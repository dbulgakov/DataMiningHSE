I didn't think she was his type.
-Neither did I.

When did they get together?
-Last weekend.

Where was that?

Jonas said that she gave him a blowjob on the toilet.

Since when are you together after a blowjob?

You're not together after that.

They were already together in the 10th grade or something.
-Yeah.

Who is this about?
-Eva, why?

It's so sick that they got together.

You look freaking hot in that shirt.

One of the prettiest girls in Pepsi Max has a boyfriend.

They fall in the same category as the Penetrator-boys.

You guys! I have fantastic news.

Are you ready?
-Say it.

Are you excited?

I have acquired "Brun og Blid" as a sponsor.

What did you say?

It's Norway's largest tanning salon chain.

I know what "Brun og Blid" is.

We will not be sponsored by them, no.

Why's that?

Because they contribute to the most speculative
and sexist market in Norway.

Have you even seen their commercials?

It's a tanning salon...

... it's difficult to promote it without
showing tanned bodies.

Noora, I worked really hard to get them to sponsor us.
You're just being really ungrateful.

Can't you see how difficult it was to persuade them?

So you think we should promote "Brun og Blid"?

And contribute to a completely inhumane body pressure?

I don't feel too much of that body pressure.

I say we milk those sexist motherfuckers
for every penny they have!

Okay... Oh my god, fucking cool.
Go for it.

But then I'm not joining the bus anymore.

Huh? Are you kidding right now?

Noora, oh my god.
Just because things don't go your way?

Now you're being really childish.
-It's just because I refuse to contribute to that inhumane body pressure.

The logo is this small. Here.

I don't understand how that will
contribute to body pressure.

Yeah well, whatever.
I give up.

Should we go as a g√•-russ then?
(= graduate not participating in the Russefeiring)

Vilde, it might come as a shock to you...

... but Russebuss is not important to me.
I just wanted to get to know Eva and Sana.

Wow, thanks for that!
-No! You too, Chris.

This discussion isn't over!

Yeah?

Did you eat my pasta?
-No.

Can you ask Eskild to turn down the music?

Eskild!

Eskild!

Sorry!

Noora?

Can you lend me 200 Kroner until Monday?

Yeah, okay.

Hi!
-Hey.

Do you need help?
-No, never.

Hello.
-Hello. What's up?

Netflix. Just Netflix...

Do you have some food?
-Yeah, of course.

I didn't have a chance to eat at home.
Too much guy-on-guy BJ action.

No, what the fuck? Your parents, or what?

I live in a shared apartment with roommates.
-Ah, okay.

But I have actually seen my parents
in BJ action.

No way! Seriously?

I would have been scarred for the
rest of my life.

What did she reply?
-"Come to my house and show me."

Are you kidding?
She is stalling.

What should I answer, then?

Who is this?
A 00'er Jonas is involved with.

I haven't even kissed her.
-But it's going to happen.

I never want to hook up
with a 00'er!

Then why are you chatting with her?

Because she has a good body.

Okay so... Jonas is flirting with a girl
and you're helping him?

Eh... yeah.

Wow! How is that working out for you?

We're friends, so it works out just fine.

Okay...

What the fuck? She sent boobs!

Are you kidding?
-No, look!

Hey, you can't show that to us!
-Why not?

Let me see! Screenshot it!

Fucking hell, they are really nice.

And she's a 00'er?
I bet she took a screenshot from a magazine or something.

No, I don't think so. She got it to look
like this with a good black and white filter.

I know the tricks. Shit!
Fuck. They are really big!

One is a little higher up than the other.

Now it's your turn. I'm sorry.

Should I go and send stuff to people?

You should send loads of dick pics, of course.

I keep it real.

It's not hard to do this.
-But it's hard to take screenshots?

Set it as your background!
What school does she go to?

We should talk about our sponsors.

Because everyone should feel like they
have a say in the Russebuss.

We are very different girls.
At the same time it's also important that we are strong and independent.

But we have to have money.
I suggest a Russebuss meeting on Friday.

Then everyone can talk properly
about the image and the concept.

We'll drink wine and just enjoy ourselves.

It's been so long since it was just us.

For me, we don't really need to do this.

It's not important to me.

I have a party in Elvebakken on Friday, so..

With who?
-With Jonas.

I promised I would go with him.

Come on! We're friends, okay?

Why is it so hard to understand that you
can be friends with your ex?

When you're a couple, it's the same thing as being
best friends. You just also have sex.

We ended the sex part.
That doesn't mean we can't still be best friends.

Did you hear William beat up someone
from Hansen this weekend?

Who was it?
-A 98'er. He was properly destroyed.

He ended up in the emergency room.

Oh my god, so cool!

I think William is very sensitive.

He knows what it's like to lose someone.

I think he's a fuckboy.
-What do you mean by losing someone?

His little sister.

He lost his little sister?
-Yeah, didn't you know?

She's dead.

A dead little sister. It's so tragic.

When did this happen?
-A long time ago.

Something like that really stays with someone.

I like that you're sitting there looking at me.

It's' so sad for him. I think that's why
he's a fuckboy.

Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

I'm not looking at you.
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

He's really a good guy. I noticed that
during Christmas.

Right, Eva?
-What?

That he's a really good guy.

It seemed like he was really keen.

Why else would he say you were hot?

You still owe me a date. Friday?

I actually don't remember what he said to me.
You still owe me a date. Friday?

I actually don't remember what he said to me.

Do you?

Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

Unfortunately, can't on Friday. Got something important.
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

What's that?
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

What's that?

Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."
What's that?

Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

Buss meeting. Russetiden preparation.
Most important thing in the world.
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

"Every guy that gets you is so fucking lucky."

"Remember when I said you weren't good enough?
That was bullshit."

"And every guy that gets you is fucking lucky."

He's totally random though.
He came up to Noora and..

Came up to Noora and then?

Nothing.

Vilde, it's never going to happen between me and William.

He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person
I've ever met.

I would never touch him.

And you shouldn't either.

You don't know him like I do.

If you had just heard him at Chrismtas.

How long can we talk about Christmas?
It's March!

Just because he came over and apologised,
because he behaved like an asshole..

.. doesn't mean he's a good person.

And it doesn't mean he's keen on you.

I'm not the one who said he was keen on me.
It was Eva who said that.

I just don't want you to get your hopes up and-

It's from William!

"Penetrator party on Friday. Bring your bus group and come."

Don't we have a bus meeting on Friday?

I thought that wasn't important to you.

I thought it was important to you
to be strong and independent?

Yeah, but I can be strong and independent
at the Penetrator party.

So we'll just drop all our plans,
because a guy calls.

Can't we have a bus meeting first,
and then go to the party afterwards?

That's exactly what we'll do.

"We're coming." Heart.. heart?

So then we'll have the bus meeting and the party,
and then you can go to that party with your best friend.

You lose.

Eskild!

Eskild!

Do you still need money?

I need help with something.
-500 Kroner.

200 Kroner.
-200 Kroner?

400 Kroner.
-300!

350! Last offer.
-350. Great.

You have to make a move on one of my friends.

Eh, yeah. Okay.

Don't you think I'm gonna set off
some gaydars?

No, oh my god. No stress.
She doesn't even know what gay is.

She's so naive.

Yeah great, okay.
Whatever.

What do you want me to do?

I'm having a bus party here tomorrow,
and you just walk in randomly.

Is there alcohol for me?

Sure!
Just be home around 7, okay?

Do I have to make out with her?
-No, no, no. Oh my god.

She just needs some attention.
Just some compliments and stuff.

Because she's crazy obsessed with a guy
who isn't interested in her.

So that's why I need you
to help her forget him.

Okay. He'll be forgotten.
-Great!

For 500 Kroner.
-No! I said 350!

If I make out with her,
we'll say 500 Kroner.

You don't need to make out with her!
-For 390 I'll touch her boobs.

350! No making out and no boob touching.

Just a little attention.
-350 and boob stroking.

No. 350 and a little attention.
-If it goes well, I can touch her boobs a little.

Oh my god, what the fuck?

It's nothing. Just to know how it feels!

.. with this here.
I thought something like..

Up here it's classy, but here it's a little slutty.

Didn't the bottles break?

A white top is just stressful. If you spill something, it becomes transparent.

Yes..
-Ah you'd like that, don't you?

No Vilde! Take this.
That one was super pretty. Now you have to stop.

I think I'm going to sleep with William tonight.

Don't forget a condom.

Are you going to sleep with Jonas tonight?
No, we're just friends.

Where are you? Come home NOW!!

So you guys haven't had sex
after you broke up?
Where are you? Come home NOW!!

So you guys haven't had sex
after you broke up?

No, I promise.
Last time we had sex was when we broke up.

That's when you broke up?

I'm serious, you have to try that once.
Fuck. The best sex I ever had.

It was really amazing.

Shouldn't you be sad after you've broken up?

Well yeah, we were. But that was what made
it so hot. So intense.

What?
-Are you sure it happened?

That it wasn't a dream
or a flashback?

Hey guys, can I ask something?

Has anyone ever gone down on you?
-No.

Yeah! Someone went down on me
in Gran Canaria last summer.

Are you kidding me?
How was it?

It was fucking nice.

I sat there and just...

Then it couldn't have been very...

I'm really scared William will try
to go down on me.

Vilde, there's no Norwegian guy
who will do it.

It's true, while we suck
dick for dear life.

Snapchat from William!
He's wondering when we're coming.

When are you gonna go to Jonas'?
-We were supposed to call. I can call him.

That snapchat to Vilde was
directed towards you.

Can't we go in half an hour?

You can't use Vilde this way.

No, oh my god! Now we're going to talk
about image, concept.

That's why we're here. Right?

Yes. What kind of concept would you like?

Jonas' phone is turned off or something.

Hi!
-There you are!

I'm having a bus party tonight.

It's nice that you're here. These are my friends.
This is Eskild. He lives with me.

Yeah, hi. Eskild.
Hi. Vilde.

Eva, if you could...
I have some tomatoes...

I'll sit here. Hi.

Here.

But eh... don't you have some wine?
-Yeah!

Oh, Chabli! Hmm.
-From 19... eh 2010.

Okay. Cheers!
-Cheers!

Noora, what should I do with the tomatoes?
-You have really pretty eyes.

You think so?

You have a lot of eye make-up.

It was Eva who did that.

You shouldn't let her do it.
She's not really good at it.

You're not a virgin, right?

No I'm not.

Can you see it?
-I might be a little direct now..

I can see it from your breasts.
Once you've had sex..

What's wrong with your phone?
Why is it turned off?

Call me when you get this.

This wine is good.
-Hello? Music?

I want to put on some music!
Which phone is it?

Let's dance!
Yes!

It's Britney, bitch.

It's William!
Hi?

Yeah...

Okay...

It's William.
He wants to talk to you.

Eh... To me?

Yeah hello.

I can't stop using Vilde
when you don't answer your phone.

What is it?

We wouldn't have been in this situation
if you had kept your promise.

No. I don't have his number.

Whose? Maybe I have it.

You go on a date with me,
and then I'll stop using Vilde.

Okay?

Okay.
-Good!

Let me speak to Vilde.

He wants to talk to you.

Hi!

What a shame.
Yeah, I understand.

Ok. Bye!

There's no Penetrator party.
-Chris' parents came home.

Can't we come along to your
Elvebakken party?

Jonas isn't answering. He turned off his phone.
-Can we at least dance and have a party?

Whose number did he want?

Next Friday. 19.00h. I'll pick you up.

Aren't you gay?

If you think I look at you like a trophy,
you're wrong. You're not good enough.

Vilde, you're super pretty.
-But not pretty enough.

If you really want to get rid of me,
go on a date with me.

Remember when I said you weren't good enough?
That was bullshit.

Okay.

Why is it so hard to understand that people
can be friends with their ex?

It's William.
He wants to talk to you.

If you go out on a date with me,
I'll stop using Vilde.

Hi. Hello.
-Hi?

We were wondering if you know Jonas.
From the first year.

I think he's in 1STD.

Eh, yeah...
-Do you know if he's together with someone?

No, I don't think so.

What about the girl with the Head jacket?

Eh, Eva?
-Yes, Eva!

No, she's not his girlfriend.

Okay, great. Thanks!

Hello.
-Hi!

What's up?

I didn't do my homework.

Have you talked to Jonas?

Yeah, why?

What actually happened on Friday?

His phone died.

So... Did he have fun at
the Elvebakken party?

They never even got there. They went to a
third year party. Do you know whose?

Apparently it was really awesome.
Lots of people from school were there.

We should've known and gone there.

Did he hook up with someone?

I don't think so. Don't know. Why?

It seems like the only thing you two talk about
is who he has hooked up with.

That's not the only thing we talk about!
Also about who I hook up with.

You haven't hooked up with anyone since
you've broken up, have you?

But if I had...
-Maybe you should.

Hook up with someone?
-Hm-hm.

I'd gladly hook up with someone,
but I just haven't hit on anyone.

What about Tinder?
-Tinder?!

Okay... what happened to you?

I think it'd be good for you to get out
there a little.

I'm not on Tinder.
-Why not?

Are you on Tinder?
-Me? No. Oh my god.

But you, Noora... Why don't we ever talk
about your love life?

We have Spanish now. Clock is ticking,
and you haven't done your homework.

(Why are you changing the subject?)

Who did you hook up with last?

I'm just saying we have Spanish now.
Stop talking about hooking up.

It's the only thing you care about.
I've never heard you talk about anything else.

It's really sick.

Maybe you should get some help.

With Spanish or hooking up?
-Both!

Should we just be wallflowers then?

It's not about being wallflowers.
It's about how we present ourselves.

We shouldn't be perceived as
sexual objects.

I don't want to be a sexual object,
I just want us to look pretty.

You use red lipstick.
Because it looks pretty on you.

That's not why I do it.
It's because I think it's nice.

I don't do it for guys.
-What's the difference?

You're really pretty today. Happy Women's Day.
Looking forward to Friday.

It's going well. We got "Brun og Blid"
as a sponsor.

How did you do that?
-I've been doing a little research after school.

I'm not really sure if we should have them
as our sponsor.

Because I don't think I want us to present
ourselves as sexual objects.

That's really important to me.

But at the same time I want us to be seen
as beautiful individuals.

Above all we will emphasize
our femininity.

I think that "Brun og Blid" is
good for that.

Why is everyone staring at Jonas?
-Didn't you hear?

No.

There are rumors that he got
a third year to come.

Come to what?

Cum-come..

He slept with a third year?

He went down on her.

Huh?
-He licked her.

But Eva, you said Norwegian guys didn't...

Hello.

Happy Women's Day.

What course do you guys have now?
-Eh, Norwegian! Yeah.

Me too. Should we just go now?

It's difficult for Tinder to know that.
It should be in the bio. 14 centimeter.

Hey you! Look who's on Tinder.

Tinder?
-Yes, Tinder! You have to come with me.

Why should I come with?

Excuse me? Check his friends.
They are fucking handsome.

They are second years at Handels.

His name is Adam. Adam... Eva...
It's perfect!

Then you can go with her!
-I'm going to Stavanger.

You?
-I have basketball camp.

It's my cousin's birthday.

Noora! Come with me, please?

You said I needed to
meet more guys.

I can't though. Sorry.
-You can't, really?

Hey, Noora?

I'll just ask you straight out.

Are you a lesbian?

There's nothing wrong with being a lesbian.
-No, no no no!

Vilde...

It's not weird that I think so! You don't have sex
and you don't want to talk about sex.

Just because I don't go around talking about
being keen on having sex...

... doesn't mean I'm a lesbian.

But what are you doing tomorrow?

It's Eskild's birthday.

Is he having a big party?
-No. A small celebration.

Not even a real celebration. Just...

Maybe we can meet up later
if you're going out?

Who was that?
-Her name is Jamila Bikarim.

Do you know each other?

She's engaged to my brother.
-Engaged?!

How old is she?
-She's 17.

Is it an arranged marriage?
-Huh?

Why would you get married when you're 17?

Because they want to have sex.

That is great.

Hello.

You're so pretty. Where are you going?
-I'm not pretty.

Okay...

I got a Facebook message
from Eva. Your friend.

She wrote: Happy birthday!

You didn't say that it wasn't your birthday?
-Huh? Not yet.

You can't say that. I had to say it was your
birthday because I have a date.

You have a date? With who?
-An asshole called William.

William? As in Vilde's William?

He's not Vilde's William.
-Okay. Drama.

He really isn't Vilde's. And you wanna know something?
I'm doing this for Vilde's sake.

You're going on a date with William for Vilde's sake?
-Yep.

Okay, how is that related?

He told Vilde she wasn't good enough.

I have to go on a date with him,
to get him to apologise to Vilde.

So you're not going on a date with William because
you want to, but to not hurt Vilde?

Yes!

She won't be hurt when she finds out you're
dating him behind her back?

Outside.

I'm not dating William. I'm going on one
date to get rid of him.

And anyway, she'll never find
out about it.

Because you won't tell Eva that it's
not your birthday, okay?

Hi.
-Hi.

Are you ready?

Ready for what?

Are you coming out,
or are you just going to sit here?

Really cool to just sit there
and be pissed.

Cocoa?

Do you see that church down there?

My grandparents lived to the right of it,

in a really big and creepy house.

They had paintings on every wall possible.

My brother said the paintings came alive
and walked around at night.

There was just one room that I liked, the TV room.

Grandma called it the Blue Room.

Walls were blue.
Chairs were blue.

Pillows were blue.
Vases were blue.

You know the wall-to-wall carpet?
Where the carpet covers the entire floor?

Yes, I know what wall-to-wall carpet is.

That was blue, too.

You're fucking with me, or what?

Hm? What?

Do you think I fall for that stuff?

What?

Everything here.

With the view, cocoa, carpet, and then you
come with that damn childhood story.

Did you see it in some high school movie
and took note of it, or?

Wow...

You're really cold.

I mean it.

Okay...

I won't talk about my childhood
stories anymore.

What do you want to talk about?

I don't want to talk about anything.

I don't want to get to know you.

I don't even want to be here.

Why are you here then?

Because you pressured me.

I actually didn't pressure you.

How did I pressure you?

Because you sent Vilde messages and you called her,
just to get to me.

How is that pressuring someone?

Because she shouldn't think there's
something between us.

You're not just saying that?
That there's nothing between us.

You're twisting it. It's much more
complicated than that.

It's not that complicated.
You're lying to a friend and you blame me.

The point is that I'm not
interested in you.

And I never will be.

Why not?

You're controlling,
and selfish.

And you use people to get your way.

You're cold,
and selfish...

You already said selfish.

And that time in the school yard when you
said Vilde wasn't good enough.

How can you say something like that?

I didn't want her to like me.

Couldn't you have said it in a better way?

Why should I have said that in a better way?
-To not hurt her.

Hurt her?

There's no point in not hurting her...

... when I don't want her to like me. It's better to be clear
so there won't be any doubt.

And destroy her self-image?

Do you really think that's how it works?
-What?

It's not possible to destroy her self-image with one comment.

In that case, I think her self-image had already
been destroyed before that.

But if you saw it from my side...
It was Vilde who came to me.

She was keen on me.
She wanted to sleep with me.

I didn't promise her anything.

However, you called me out in the
middle of the school yard.

Does that make you good?
Does that make you fair?

Shouldn't you have warm cocao?
-No.

I like the cold.

Then it tastes like chocolate milk.

It's good that you apologised about telling Vilde
she's not good enough.

Is it?
-Hm-hm.

Okay.

I hope it was a smart plan,
because now she likes me again.

I don't like her.

So then we'll end up in the same place,
won't we?

Hello?

Where?

Where are you?

We have to go.

What's up?
-I'll drive you home.

But just so that we're clear,
so that there won't be any misunderstandings.

I've made up for it now.

I don't owe you anything.

No, you don't owe me anything.

Did you hear William beat up someone from Hansen this weekend?

You're going on a date with William...
for Vilde's sake?

It was good that you apologised to Vilde.

About her not being good enough for you.

I hope it was a smart plan.

Because now she's keen on me again.

I'm not keen on her.

Where are you?

We have to go.

Eva?

Eva!

Noora!

Hi.

Hi.

I slept here.

I can see, you know.

Who is he?

His name is H√•vard.
-Halvor.

How was your date yesterday?

Eh... fine.

How was he?

Nice.

Nice? You have to tell me more!

Good morning!
-Hey birthday boy!

You know what?

I think I'm still drunk. A little.

Could you be a little bit more quiet?

Okay, Linn!
We'll be quiet all day!

I need some water.

Eskild!

What did you say to Eva?

I didn't say anything.

I said you'd gone on a Tinder date with a guy.

Tinder?!

Hello, what world do you live in?

I had to say something about why you
weren't out celebrating my birthday with me.

Eskild, it wasn't your birthday.

You can't just hang out with my friends
when I'm not here.

We chatted a little on Facebook.
She said she wanted to party.

I wanted to party too, so...

Eskild, you...

Are you jealous? Jealous that I'm taking all your friends?

Because I'm popular? Because I'm hot?

Because...

I won't take your place in your friends gang.
-I'm trying to be serious!

You are hugely popular and so funny!
Pretty! Smart! Good!

Do you need a hug?
-No! I don't need a hug.

Bear hug.

Is it better now?
Do you want a hug?

You... Are you okay now?

Just take me seriously!
-Yes, I am taking you seriously!

The Yakuza-boys were like:
Hey, guys! Stop, you're killing him!
(Yakuza-boys = a different Russ bus group)

He sat on top and hit and hit him, but he screamed:
Haven't you had enough now?!

He just lay there and wasn't even able to respond.
He just spit up blood.

Did you see the video?

It was so rough!

The Yakuza-guys fought with a knife.

... he found his mother dead in the bathtub.
After that something snapped in him.

.. and so I wrote to him: Heard there was a fight on Friday.
Are you okay?

He didn't answer.
I was terribly worried.

I heard that he wasn't even there.

Who did you hear that from?

I was talking to Iben, and he told me it was only
Chris and a few others who were there.

That's why it was really unfair.

Because there were 20 Yakuza-boys.

They were looking for William, but William wasn't there.

So they were beaten up..

.. while William was at home fucking some girl.

What girl?

It's just a rumor.
I don't know if it's true.

Did William reply?

No, he didn't reply. So I sent:

"William, could you answer, so I know you're alive?
I'm terribly worried."

Then he replied at 11.33: "Alive. I'm alive."

Has anyone seen them?

Chris is definitely still at the hospital.

Isn't that William's car?

Did Iben say more about the girl William was with?

It could be Olivia from the third year.

Or Marte from 1STA.

No, she's a bit strange.

What's the name of the girl that came out of the cafeteria?

She's quite pretty.

Or maybe the dark girl? Isabel?

Wasn't she with Jonas..

Hey!

It could be Anja from 2STB,
but she isn't really his type.

She is a bit... thick.

Huh?

You have to stop now. She's fat?!

Not fat-fat. I'm just saying William likes skinny girls.

That's the dumbest thing I've heard, Vilde.

I'm just saying that boys like different things.

Some like small butts, others like big ones.

Not everyone has to be super skinny,
but William likes girls who are model thin.

Like you.

If it's true that William's dating a girl,
she's definitely really skinny.

It's not to diss Anja.
Gum?

I'm going to find out who it is on Friday.

Friday?

If William's actually dating someone, she's definitely coming to his party.

Party?

Oh yeah! We can't drink at my place.

Mom's coming home.

Can we do it at your place?

Eh, yeah. But I won't be at William's party.

Why not?

Because I can't on Friday.

You never want to go out anymore.

You didn't go out last weekend, either.

There was no one who could go out last weekend.

Is there someone you're hiding from us?

A little girlfriend, maybe?

Bring her to William's party.

Seriously? I can? That's so amazing, Vilde!

Maybe she can come to the cabin?
A lesbian couple in Hemsedal.

That would be so cozy!

Right, Eva?

Yeah!

What do you have now?

Chemistry.

I have class in the B-building, so.

Bye!

Vilde...

Fucking hell, it's you! Isn't it?

You're dating William!

Eva, before you freak out here...

Fucking hell. Fucking hell!

Hallo, okay. We've been on one date
and I did it for Vilde.

Why for Vilde?

Because the stuff he said to her during Christmas,
he just said it because I promised I'd go on a date with him.

Are you kidding me?

Am I on an episode of Gossip Girl?

Eva, you know I hate that show.

This is totally sick!

But you don't like him at all, right?

Eva, it's William we're talking about here.

So how was your date then?

Weird!

Do you realise now why I can't go to the party?

If William starts to make a move on me...

... Vilde will start to realise it.

I just hope she doesn't start asking him about it.

I don't trust him at all.

Fucking hell. This is Gossip Girl.

Okay, maybe a budget version.
But it's fucking Gossip Girl!

I've had it with all the Gossip Girl references now.

Funny!

Noora, you're impressive.

Thanks.

I don't understand how Eskild can party so much.

I think it's lovely to just be at home and relax.
Don't you agree?

Hm-hm.

Does school suck?

I hated high school. It truly sucked.

The teachers had no sympathy.

"The curriculum is the same for everyone."
Easy for them to say.

We are the performance generation.

We have it a little worse than they had.

At first I was like that as well.

"Fuck this shit."

"I need a year off."

Drama between Vilde and William. Vilde is crying in the bathroom.

Since you're already standing up...

... could you hand me a Fun light?

Noora! Hi!

What happened? Where's Vilde?

She ran away.

But you're here now!

But... what happened?

You said there was some drama between Vilde and William.

Shit!

She's so in love with William,
but I don't think he's in love with her.

They didn't say anything about me?

They said nothing?

No.
-No?

Shhh. Shhh!

You were on a date!

Do you think he...

I don't know, but I have to...

Yeah, you have to go say hi!

Halvor... and Jacob!

He is so sweet. He's almost my boyfriend.

No! Jonas! You came!

We are best forever, right?

I love you so fucking much. Did you know that?

I've said it a few times already.

Drink a little, guys.

You should meet girls.

Where are you going?

To the toilet.

You can't leave her.

It takes two seconds.

I'll be back soon, okay?

You came.

What did you say to Vilde?

What?

She walked out crying.

She wanted to hook up,
but I wasn't interested.

You didn't say anything about me?

About you? Who are you?

I'm kidding. Of course I didn't say anything about you.

Fuck off!

What the hell is going on here?

Who are you?

William.
-William? Axel.

The party you're having here...
You have to put an end to it.

We've gotten complaints from your neighbors.

Music off, and people out.

Everyone. Great.

Eva?

Hello!

The party is over, ladies and gentlemen.

William, I have to borrow your cellphone.

Eva left with all my stuff.

Hi Eskild. I have lost everything.
My phone and keys.

Call me when you get this message.

On this number.

Chris.

It's time to leave.

Are you coming with me?

Kidding...

Did you get to her?

No.

But I left a message on the voice mail
of someone I live with so...

He'll definitely call back soon.

When are your parents coming home?

They're not coming home.

Where are they?

Dad lives in London and mom lives
on Snar√∏ya with a new man.

You live here by yourself?

More or less.

I don't drink.

Shock...

Don't you have siblings?

My brother studies in Stockholm.

Do you want something else?

Do you have... cocoa?

Baking cocoa?

Yeah, I don't know why I got it. The lady at the
check out got it for me so it was okay.

It says something about dark cocoa drink here.

Extra dark and powerful cocoa.

Five tablespoons of Freia baking cocoa.

Four to five tablespoons of sugar.

Yeah?
-Yeah!

Don't you remember how to make it?
-I do, but I just want to do it right.

Okay.

Why don't you live with your mom?

Because my mom is a cunt.

Hey...

What?

It's still your mom.

So what?
Should I not be honest?

Sure, but you don't need to be a complete
misogynist about it.

So you only want me to be honest if it's politically correct?

Has Eskild called?

No.

You have to check your cellphone.

Fuck.

Do you want one?

Oh my god, seriously?

Can I have it?

Do I look good?

It's the sweater of all sweaters.
Many at school have acquired it.

Insanely popular.
Then I would've been just like you.

That's the dream, right?

A guitar too?

Have we really come to this point?
There's nothing missing then, so to speak.

Do you play for girls?

So sweet.

Sweet, indeed.

Yeah.

Do you play for them before you take them to bed?
You have to, right?

You have to do something.

What do you play?
-I don't play for girls.

Yes you do.
What else? Oof.

There's sound! It's a real one, then?

You obviously play for girls. I know it.
What do you play?

Is it country?

I know what you play.
You just..

Was that it? No? No..

Then it's more like..

With a little rapping. No? Really?

Now I know, William.
I know it.

I think it's for you.

Hello, where are you?
-At home. What's up?

I lost all my stuff.
Keys, cellphone, everything.

Okay, so... That sucks.
-It really sucks!

At least I'm at home now.
Just call from downstairs and I'll let you in.

Yeah... Yeah okay. Bye.

Is he home?

Eh, no. No.
He is in the city with some people.

So...

I can sleep on the couch.

Oh, no. This works, right?

Just stick to your side of the bed, okay?

It's my bed, so both sides are mine.

No. That's not how it works here now, William.

You may not be used to this, but...

... there are sides to this bed.

This is your side. This is my side.

I suggest that we build a little border.

So don't come over and invade my personal space.

Are you going to sleep with all your clothes on?
-Yes.

Okay.

What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

I won't be eating breakfast here.

Eggs and bacon? Great.

You are the biggest clich√© I've met.

Ever!

I was never validated as a child.

Mom never came to graduation.
Dad never complimented my drawings.

Okay.

But you like me for it.

No, I don't.

Yes, you do. You like me.

What is it?
Is there someone you have to beat up?

It's a message from Eskild.

He doesn't want to stay up and wait for you any longer
and wonders when you're coming home.

I'll answer:
Noora is so keen on me...

... that she failed to get away.

Excuse me? No! You're not writing that!
-Excuse me, you're on my side now!

Can you... please get over on your side?
-Can I?

That's your side of the bed.

And this is my side of the bed.

So we're going to let the cellphone and pillows be.

Let go, let go, let go!

Just write that I'm coming home tomorrow.

You like me.

Goodnight, Willhelm.

Goodnight, Noora.

William likes girls who are model thin.

If it's true that Williams dating someone,
I'm sure she's super skinny.

Gum?

Drama between Vilde and William.
Vilde is crying in the bathroom.

What did you say to Vilde?

She wanted to hook up with me,
but I wasn't interested.

What's going on here?

You like me.
-No I don't.

Yes you do.
You like me.

SKAM
Easter Special

You said it was in Hemsedal!
I said it was just outside of it.

According to Google Maps it's an hour
and a half away. That's not just outside of it.

It's shorter from Oslo to Hemsedal.

Are you kidding me? What are we going to
find here? It's in the middle of nowhere.

Who is he?

Hi.

I've made the cabin ready for you.

Eh, okay. Ready how?

The only thing is that...
the electricity is a bit unstable.

Just be careful.

So you help grandmother with the cabin?

Yes.

Okay.

Bye.

My name is Kasper.

Okay.

What a creepy guy!

It's good that he helps grandma with the cabin.
-But he's a bit weird.

Just because people are different outside
of Ring 3... (= the road that can be seen as Oslo's border)

... doesn't mean he's creepy.

So he said: "Vilde, you are
really sweet, but I have to stop you."

So I said: "Is it because you like someone else?"

And he said: "It's because I'm not interested."

I don't understand it. He's hot and
then he's cold. Then hot, then cold.

We should've been in Hemsedal now.
So you could've gotten a rebound hook up.

What's this?

It looks similar to that Kasper who we met.

Maybe Kasper's up for a rebound hook up.

Maybe there's someone on Tinder.
-Nobody measures up to William anyway.

All are like 20 kilometers away.
Maybe there's someone on Jodel?

There's nothing on Jodel.
I'm not kidding.

This is the first time I've experienced this.
-We've lost contact with the world.

I wrote: "Hi! Can anyone hear us?
Is there no one out there?"

I wonder what William
is thinking about now.

Do we really have to talk
about guys the entire time?

What else can we do?
There's nothing to do here.

We're in a cabin! We have to play games,
or something.

Are there no games here, Chris?

TP? (Trivial Pursuit)
No, not TP.

Do you actually have to
wear your hijab all the time?

Why? Are you stressed out by it?

No but, we're just with girls here.
You're not forced to wear it.

Vilde, no one is forcing me to
wear it. I wear it because I want to.

Okay, I have something better than a game.

I have an Ouija board.
-What's that?

It's fucking fun. You can ask spirits
questions and they'll answer you.

For example, what is William thinking of now?

Yes, we'll play!

I'm going to lie down.
-Why?

Are you superstitious, Sana?
Night, Vilde.

Okay, let's play!

Dear spirit who's here now,
does Jonas still have feelings for me?

Nothing's happening.

Are you doing this, Chris?
-I swear it's not me.

Fuck. I knew it.
This really sucks.

Why does it suck?
-We can't be friends if he still has feelings for me.

You should have seen him at William's party.

He was so jealous.
-Okay, but now it's my turn.

Dear spirit, what's William thinking
of right now?

Someone here? But who?

No, now it's my turn Vilde.

Can you ask who?
-Eh, no.

Why not?

Because I'm not curious what William's thinking
about. I want to know something else.

Dear spirit, why didn't Sana want
to play with the Ouija board?

Psychic.
-I knew it!

I knew there was something
strange about her.

For example, that she wears her
hijab all the time.

What does that have to do with it?

That's really mysterious.

Your turn, Chris.

Can you ask who William's thinking of?
-No, I'm not gonna ask about your man.

I'm gonna ask about my man, okay?

Spirit, let's talk about Isak.

Why is he even together with Sara?

Do you miss me?

Hom?

Gay?

These spirits are smoking crack.
What's going on?

Let's take a break now. -No, now it's my turn
and I want to ask who William's thinking of.

We can just take a break.
-No! I've waited all round.

We can take a break after
I've asked my question.

I don't think the spirit is very serious if
it says Isak is gay.

Eva!

Okay, who's fucking around now?

Huh?

Is it you?
-No, what's up?

Someone has replied on Jodel,
and it says:

"Does Jonas still have feelings for me?"

"What is William thinking of right now?"

"Why is Sana not playing with the Ouija board?"

Are you joking?

2016..
Spirits are on Jodel.

From "very close".

Is it you?
-No, I promise!

You had your phone just now.
You're the only one who could've done it.

It wasn't me!
-Show your phone.

Why should I show my phone?

To see if it was you.
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

Why are you so scared
to show your phone?

What just happened?

It was like a light went on for me.

William is now a Russ.
And once someone's a Russ, they don't want a girlfriend.

Everyone knows that.

So even if he has a lot of feelings for me,
I can't fulfill them.

Because he knows it's better to reject me now
than to hurt me during Russetiden.

I'm not saying he has feelings for me,
but when the spirit said..

he thought of someone here,
I thought it was noteworthy.

Vilde, do you want bread?
-No, thanks.

Why not?

Because I'm allergic to gluten.

You don't have a gluten allergy.

Yes, I do. I have all the symptoms.
Which ones?

Skin problems, hair loss,
acne, and itchiness.

I'm tired and weak all the time.

It still doesn't work?

I sent my grandma a message
asking for Kasper's number.

Maybe it was Kasper who replied
to us on Jodel at night?

What reply on Jodel?
-Someone on Jodel wrote everything we said.

Is that him?

What is it?

A message from my grandma.

"Kasper who? There's no guy helping
me with the cabin."

Should I write "who are you" on Jodel?
-Yeah, do it.

You're not going to get any answers.

Sana?

Can I ask you if you're psychic?

Why would you ask that?

I was just wondering.
-There's no bus before tomorrow.

Are you kidding me?

Hello people, can we relax a little?

You don't seriously think Kasper
is out to get us?

Say that's the case, what is he going to do?
There's five of us, he's by himself.

And he's really small, too.

We're stuck here anyway.
Let's at least have a good mood here.

If you clean up a little here,
we can go and make some food.

Vilde, are you coming?
Why?

Because we're in a cabin.
Everyone has to help.

Can you peel these and then slice them?

What are we making?
-Tortilla.

Do you need potatoes for tortilla?
-Yes.

I'm actually not fond of potatoes.
-Why not?

I just don't like them.
And they're really unhealthy.

No Vilde, potatoes aren't unhealty.
Your body needs potatoes.

Do you know what's so
good about potatoes?

Potatoes have a lot of starch.
That's really good for you.

Because you said you're tired
and weak all the time.

And then there's Vitamin C.
-That's good for a cold.

Vitamic C is like an antioxidant...

To get rid of potentially dangerous chemicals.

Those chemicals aren't good.
-It can actually cause cancer.

And old skin, Vilde.

Completely true. But vitamin C fixes that,
isn't that cool?

Yeah.

So then we'll have eggs.

Eggs are full of protein.

If you want to be strong
when you do sit ups...

... and if you want to have abs,
you need protein.

Eggs pretty much have
all eight amino acids...

... you need them if you want to have a toned body.

Did you know that eggs
increase your metabolism, too?

No.

How do you know so
much about food?

Has anyone done a self defense course?
-Just cooking courses.

I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.
-If we sleep tonight...

So girls. Whatever happens,
we can't split up.

That always happens in horror movies,
and then they die.

I don't understand what he wants.
-He wants to have sex.

That's the only thing men want.

You want that too.
-Yes, but not with him here and now.

We won't talk about guys now.
-Perhaps another time. But I don't have time for that.

What should we do?
We just have to think a little.

If your mom doesn't answer soon,
we have to call the police.

She doesn't answer.
-The police can't do anything.

Of course they can!

There's a person stalking us.
That's what the police are for.

Put your phone away.

There's something I have to tell you.

But you can't freak out.
-I can't be freaked out more than I already am.

Vilde?
-Yeah?

Remember when you asked me why
I never take off my hijab?

Yes.

The hijab makes sure...
I don't know how to explain this.

But I wear it...

... so I can see things no one
else can see.

Are you psychic?

Call it what you want.

But ever since we got here...

I've seen images...

Of Kasper...

What kind of images?

Images from another time.
-Fucking hell.

Are you kidding me?

I see him right now.

He's standing behind that door.

Fucking hell.
I'll going to start crying.

What does he want?

He wants to be seen.

He says we have to see people like him.
-People who are a little different.

That was really sick.
Look, I'm shaking.

I can't do this without you.

You have to be with me.

Be with you for what?

We have to see him.
That's the only way we can make him disappear.

You don't have to be scared.

I'll go in front.

My hijab will protect us.

Are you guys ready?

He's standing back there!

Fucking hell!
-Are you kidding me?

Oh my god!

Fuck!

That's badly done.

I hate you! Fuck!

Dont cry.

I'm not crying!

Yes you are!

"I'm shaking. I'm shaking."

What about you?

You went: "We have to accept death."

You should've seen your face when Sana
said she was psychic because of her hijab.

It wasn't that weird that
I believed it.

You know that it's just an ordinary scarf?

But then what's the deal with Kasper?

Kasper's just a guy from the electrician
who helps my grandma with the cabin.

Are you joking? -Why do you think he was outside
when the power came on?

Fucking hell, oh my god.
-Everything was bullshit?

Yeah! Sana told me it was her who fucked
with us on Jodel yesterday.

Was that you?
-Yeah!

We decided to continue fucking with you,
because it was so much fun!

It worked good as hell!

You're really sick!
You can't do this to people!

Don't take it so seriously.

But what about the Ouija board?
-Was it real that William was thinking of me?

Vilde, it also said Sana was psychic
and Isak was gay.

So don't take it seriously.

Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

But it also said Jonas still has feelings for me.
Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

And I know that's true!
Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

So it's not completely false.
Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.
Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.

And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.

Sick that he got with a 97'er.
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.

Sick that he got with a 97'er.

You should try it.

Fucking hell!
You should try it.

Are you still in shock?
You should try it.

Best female actress goes to... Sana!
You should try it.

You should try it.

He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person I've ever met.

I would never touch him.

And you shouldn't either.

You like me.

You should've seen him at William's party,
he was so jealous.

I heard that the little hipster ex of your friend
got together with Isabel from my class?

Oh my god, look at this.

Looks good? You think it looks good?
It's hideous.

Can you picture a girl in this?

Yeah, maybe in Syria.
But like, in Norway? No.

Hey welcome back, Noora.

I didn't know you were coming back this afternoon.

This is Lito.

My name is Lito.

We're just going through some of your clothes
to see if there's anything you don't need.

Like this, for example?

Eskild, what are you doing? You can't take
my clothes without asking me first.

Oh I'm sorry, are we imposing?

No, no. Don't be silly.
She never uses clothes like this.

Yeah, we're just going through
your clothes as I said because...

... as you know there's a big crisis
in Syria right now.

There's a lot of Syrian refugees
that need your help.

So I was just thinking you
could donate some.

Okay...

Yes, I guess. But maybe just not that top.

Because it has meaning to me so.

What meaning?
-It's from when I lived in Madrid.

Isn't he handsome?
I think he's gay.

Eskild, what are you doing? You can't
just give away my clothes...

... to a Syrian refugee just to
check him out.

He's not a Syrian refugee.
He studies in Norway.

His father is the Turkish ambassador.

Lito has taken leave from university.
To help the refugees full time.

Sexy?

Sexy? There's nothing sexy about the refugee
crisis. It's incredibly serious.

It's incredibly serious, and you say stuff like:
"Oh no, not that top. It has meaning to me."

See, here she comes. A saint!

Little princess here is rising.
Very good!

Tennis racket, we have a CD player, Rubik's cube.
Lots of hoodies and sweatpants.

Don't know if it's clean.
-Thanks so much, Linn.

You know what Noora,
you're actually a bit stingy.

There are many people who need it
so much more than you.

I'm not stingy.
I care a lot aobut the refugee crisis.

You can't just come into my room and-

Is everything good?

Yes.

Yeah it's all good.
-Everything's fine.

Yeah, it's okay. It's just like...
she loves this top, so...

Yeah but I mean, we got a lot of clothes
and stuff, don't we?

If I take this and this,
you can take the rest.

I'll take this top here, Noora.
You don't need it.

Excuse me?
-Noora, don't be so stingy.

I love dresses with pockets.

It looks hot.

It starts to sink when you have your
cellphone in it.

But this is ugly.

No, nothing is ugly.
But it's a little...

Bye bye.

That one was nice.
I don't wear it. I can't go in white.

I'll get make-up on it and I'll
spill while eating.

You should wear it.

Do you want it?

No, we have to give stuff away.
-Yeah, you need it more than me.

We have to show that we care.
-I care!

You know Eskild...
He said that I don't care.

I do care about the refugee crisis.
It's Eskild who doesn't care.

He's just trying to get with
that Lito guy.

He's convinced that he's gay.
Though he's not.

I don't understand why people who are gay
just assume everyone else is gay too.

What's the deal with that?

Did you happen to hear that it's
over between Isak and Sara?

No.

I think it was her who broke
up with him.

Oh!

This is from Jonas.

I have to give it back to him, right?
It's not that nice, so...

Have you talked to Jonas since
we've come home?

Eh, no. I've tried but I feel like
he's trying to ignore me.

Oh? - I think he's a little embarrassed
about what happened at William's party.

But if he still has feelings for me,
we have to be able to talk about it.

I want us to be friends.
I don't want it to get in the way.

I think it's important that you
guys talk to each other.

Yeah I will. He can't ignore me when
school starts again.

How's it going with you and William?

There is no me and William.

No, I know. I was only joking.

I know that. Vilde would have a
breakdown if she knew.

I've never seen someone so obsessed
with another person. Have you?

No...

You don't think she's going to pay
to hook up, right?

What hook up?

Didn't you see the Penetrator stuff? They're
having a fundraiser. You didn't see it?

No?

Are you kidding me?
Okay, I have to show you.

It's really sick.

During Easter they trashed
a cabin in Trysil.

They got a bill of
300 fucking thousand Kroner.

It's so sick.

So now they're having a fundraiser.

Look: Help the Penetrators.

They're selling sweaters and
there's an auction to hook up with someone.

Hooking up with William starts
at 1000 Kroner. So sick!

They will have a charity party on Friday.

Hello, this is prostitution.

It wouldn't suprise me if Vilde ends
up paying to hook up with William.

Hi.

Willhelm!

Fucking hell, it's
lovely to see you.

Did you miss me?
-No!

Not even a little bit?
-I didn't.

Did you have a good Easter?

Yeah. Did you?

Good, yeah. Just a little wild.

I saw your event on Facebook.
Charming stuff.

You have to come.
-No!

Why not?

Because it's the dumbest thing I've seen in
my entire life.

Hook up auction? Seriously?

You know it's actually illegal? It's prostitution.

Are you jealous?

No.

Because I'll hook up with someone else?

That's why you're
being so grumpy.

I'm not grumpy. And I'm definitely not jealous.

I just think the entire event is horrible.

Europe is in a state of emergency.
Twelve million Syrians are fleeing.

People are dying of hunger.

What does it have to do with this?
-It has everything to do with this!

You guys trashed a cabin
for 300 thousand!

While the world is starving.

Imagine how much people are willing
to spend to hook up.

How high will they go?
Ten thousand Kroner to hook up with someone? No!

Think of... William. It's sick!
-Those people are stupid.

They'll fail to raise it all
on Friday anyway.

There's the hooking up, the sweaters,
partying on their bus with them.

They make a lot of effort.
They care about both-

Hello!
-Hi!

I brought lunch for you as well.

Oh, yeah.

Will you ask Noora, Vilde?
-Yeah!

We were talking about helping the
Penetrator-boys, out of solidarity.

We can use some of the money from our
bus budget for their bus.

But it's a bit boring to just donate money.

So we discussed participating in the hook up
auction. It's for a good cause.

Vilde, what world do you live in?

You know that millions of
refugees are starving?

And you think this is a good cause?

You think that we should give money
to a bunch of asshole kids?

Guys who just got themselves drunk
and trashed an entire cabin?

You don't always need to be so uptight.
Try to have a little humor.

It's a social event that gets the entire
school together. It's not just for fun.

It helps the refugees more than when we
sit at home and be sad for them.

If you used half of the energy you use
to think about William...

... to think of refugees instead,
it might have helped a little bit.

So no hook up auction then?
-No, Vilde.

What about the party?
-Of course we're going to the party.

Are you guys serious now?
-Come on, Noora!

If even Sana thinks it's fun! She knows a litte
bit more about being a refugee than you.

Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.

Why do I know anything about being a refugee?
Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.

Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.

I was born in Norway.
Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.

Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.

But only if you come to the party.

Because you're from another culture.
But only if you come to the party.

But only if you come to the party.

No... I'm from the same culture as you.
But only if you come to the party.

But only if you come to the party.

You know you're sick in the head right?

You're a muslim.
You know you're sick in the head right?

You know you're sick in the head right?

Eh, yeah?
You know you're sick in the head right?

You know you're sick in the head right?

Muslim is another culture.

Islam is a religion, Einstein.

What's up today? Is it the pick-on-Vilde day?

It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.

Why are you all ganging up on me?
It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.

It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.

Have you thought about how much of my soul I put into this project?
It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.

It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.

20%

It's not to be popular, but to be with you guys.
20%

20%

It's you I love.

Can you not try to give back a little?
I'm giving you everything. Everything!

Deal. But then you should be really sweet at the party.
Can you not try to give back a little?
I'm giving you everything. Everything!

Deal. But then you should be really sweet at the party.

Yeah alright!

We're going to the party. Okay!

And.. the hook up auction?

No, Vilde.

Do you want to pay to
hook up with William?

Yes.

You know it's illegal?
It's prostitution.

Not if there's no sex.

It's hooking up.
Sex doesn't fall under hooking up.

Everyone knows that.

And you've already won the hook up auction.
So you no longer have to be jealous.

I'm not jealous and I'm not joining the auction.

Yes you are.

You see that? They care about refugees.

They're not a bunch of assholes.

Hey, there's Jonas!

Yeah...

There's something I have to tell you.
-Yeah?

I had hoped Jonas would
have told you himself.

Jonas is together with Isabel.

They got together on Easter.

Perhaps I should've told you...

... but I thought it would be best
if you heard it from Jonas.

But he never said it, so...

What are you thinking?

I'm fine.

Sure?
-Yeah, yeah!

Eva, you're allowed to be upset.

He's your ex-boyfriend.

I'm not upset. I'm fine, really.

I think it's only good that he moved on.
We really are just friends.

It's fine.

You sure?

Yes, I'm totally sure.

Come, let's party now.

I think he's terribly in love with her.

They say you can see it in the way
he looks at her.

When he looks at her
when she's not looking at him.

He looks so... He smiles at her
in a certain way.

Not really smiling, but you see
something in his eyes.

That he... I don't know.

Do you think she's prettier than me?

Huh?

She is. Much, much prettier than me.

Eva, you have to stop now.
She's not prettier than you.

I just don't understand why
he didn't say anything.

He just pretends like it's nothing.

He has to say he has a girlfriend.
He has to introduce me.

They're going to announce who won
the hook up auction soon.

Where did you see that? -The girl who will
make out with William has paid 3000 Kroner.

You know what? If he hadn't thought
of introducing us to each other...

... then I'll do it myself.

Hi! Isak!
-What's up?

I've missed you.

We never hang out anymore.

You know what?
You're so sweet.

Jonas has a girlfriend!
Did you know? She's a third year.

I've really missed you.
It's so good to see you.

No.
-What?

We'll just drop it.

Don't you want to make
out with me? Huh?

No, we'll just drop it.

Is it because you like guys?

He doesn't want to
make out with me.

We should go drink some water.

... who has won the hook up auction?

The girl who won is...

What are you saying?
I can't hear what you're saying.

I'm not going to say it.
-You're not saying it?

Vilde! Take care of Eva.

She should have water.

Vilde...
-Hi.

I love you.

Should we get you some water?

Isak doesn't want to make out with me.
-No, he doesn't?

But... Hi!

Do you want to make out with me?

There you are.

What's this stuff about the announcement
of the hook up auction?

And you're pissed as usual.

I mean it.

Have you gone around telling
people bullshit? -Bullshit?

You have to relax a little.
Have some faith in me.

Faith? Why should I have
faith in you?

You don't care about anyone
but yourself.

I care. 20% of the funds
goes to the refugees.

Because I'm here.

They don't care why
they're getting money.

You don't care about them. Not for real.

I care about you.

For real.

No. You don't.

If you really did you wouldn't have pressured me
to come to the party like this.

You don't have to be here
if you don't want to.

Yes, I do! How else will the
refugees get their money?

The refugees will get their
money anyway. So relax.

Yeah, but eh...

I have to be here and watch Eva.
So she doesn't do something stupid.

How do you think that's going?

I think I have to puke.
-You have to puke?

You have to puke?!
You can't puke here.

Aren't you getting tired of this game soon?

What game?

Pretending as if you don't like me?

That's not a game.
I'm not pretending.

Okay. This is what we'll do.

Look into my eyes.
And tell me you don't like me.

That's the dumbest thing I've heard.

Look at me.

Say you don't like me,
and I'm gone.

I swear.

I don't like you.

You don't have the right
to be pissed at me.

I'm not pissed at you.

I'm just trying to do what's
right here. What you're doing is shit.

As long as you get your way.

Okay.

You're insanely selfish, manipulating,
and self-involved.

And spoiled.
That's why I don't like you.

Was that all?

No!

Don't you have siblings?
-My brother studies in Stockholm.

William is a Russ.

When someone becomes a Russ,
they don't want to have a girlfriend.

Everyone knows that.

Say that you don't like me, and I'm gone.

You are so insanely selfish...

... and manipulative and self-involved.

Was that all?

Are you looking at me while I'm sleeping?

No.

Noora Amalie S√¶tre

Now you have to be careful.

Because you're going to be so damn in love with me.

I'm not in love with you.

You are in love with me.

You don't even have clothes on.

I do have clothes on!

Give me two weeks and they're gone.

That is not gonna happen.
-It is gonna happen.

I told you that I won't have sex before I get married, right?

Jesus...

It's true!

Okay... We're going to get married then.

Okay...

I mean it.

I can't get married...

... to someone called... Willhelm.

Stop calling me Willhelm.

Oh my, but that's your name.

Is that not what you're called?

Oh that's awkward!
Oops! Oh god.

Where are you going?

I'm going to get water.

There's no water today.

Today we'll just lay here.

We have to go to school.

Not yet.
We'll just lay here a little first.

But I'm thirsty
Shhh...

William!

You can say my name?

Just let me get water.

How do I know you're only going to get water?

Because I say so.

Why should I trust you?

You ran away from me earlier, before I woke up.

Hey you...

Hm?

I'm just going to get water.

I swear.

You have 30 seconds.

I'll keep track of time.

Hi.

Sorry, did I wake you?

No.

Nikolai, William's brother.

Noora.
-Noora, hello!

And there's William! Hello!

Niko, what are you doing here?

I'm cooking.

In Oslo?

Yeah. Needed a little break.

Okay...

Are you perhaps hungry?

No.

No?

Ok. Little rude, right?

Maybe your girlfriend wants something to eat?

She's not my girlfriend and she's leaving now.

Can you find the way out by yourself,
or do you need me to help?

Bye.

Was it a bad vibe, or?

No, she's nothing.

What are you making?

Damn, terrible pictures.

It looks so painful!

I'm getting chills.

It's my fault.

Had it not been for me,
Jonas would have never started fighting with him.

I didn't even know he was with Yakuza.

He isn't with them.
But he's friends with quite a lot of them.

The Yakuza-guys are just looking for people to beat up.

He has to do something.
The Yakuza-guys have too much power.

They can't do anything.
Won't they just fight each other forever?

Noora, you have such good morals.

No, but I mean it.
I really look up to you.

Thanks.

How is Jonas doing?

He's still ignoring me.

It's Isabel. She's the one who told him
he can't talk to me.

She seems really bossy.
As if she has him on a leash.

Smart of her.

Why is that?

To keep him away from you.

I'm not going to sleep with Jonas.

No, but you always feel something for your ex.

You hold the advantage.

How?

You're not together with him anymore.

How is that an advantage?

When a boy is together with a girl,
suddenly all the others seem more exciting.

Seriously?

Yes.

Boys are naturally like that.

Guys' instict is to spread their genes as much as possible.

That's why guys sleep around.

If you want to hold on to a guy...

You have to make sure his needs are covered

And keep others at a distance.

Isabel is just trying to be his girlfriend.

Can't blame her for that.

Enough about spreading genes.. Anyone else excited
about the start of Russetiden this Friday?

Nice lipstick.

Thanks.

Where is it from?

Clinique, I believe.

It suits you.
Really sexy.

You're ignoring me.

William, you can't talk to me here!

I have to... when you're not answering your phone.

I have math now.

We have to talk first.

Well, then talk!

That stuff yesterday didn't have anything to do with you.

It did have something to do with me.
You treated me like crap.

The thing is that my brother was dumped by his girlfriend.

They were together for years.

He's really depressed.

So what?

It didn't feel right to introduce you.

And to rub it in.
-Rub in what?

Us.

I'm sorry.

I'm just really bad at that kind of stuff.

Hey you...

I didn't mean to hurt you.

You didn't hurt me!

I'm not hurt even a little bit.

Okay...

I just think you were a real asshole.

Yeah I agree. I was an asshole.

It won't happen again.

I promise.

It was actually really good that it happened.

I was afraid that you would go around thinking we were a couple.

But then at least I don't have to be afraid of that now.

We are together, though.

No.

Yes we are.

You have to fix your hair.

Those girls are so scary.

Should I delete the picture, Sana?

No.

What picture?

(My pillow smells of you.
I had a dream about you last night)

Don't delete the picture.

(Did you get up? What did you dream?)

(That we had sex)

(You were so delicious)

Did you just go and work out? During lunch break?

Russetiden season is approaching.
And bikini season.

Is anyone looking forward to the Penetrator concept?

I bet it's something kinky.

I wonder how many girls William will sleep with during Russetiden.

Is it okay with you that he's going to sleep with lots of girls?

Are you jealous?

No, I just have to accept it.

He has been working towards this for 3 years.
It's the most important time in his life.

I wonder if he will beat his brother's record.
He slept with 130 girls during his Russetiden.

He has a brother?

Yes, Nico. From '95.
He left Nissen 2 years ago.

A true fuckboy.

So there are two of them?

My sister studies in Stockholm with him.
She told me he gave half the Stureplan chlamydia.

Seriously?

That's really nasty.

The Magnusson brothers...

"Begge samma ulla, alle skall bli knulla"

It's the Karpe Diem song.

This here is not going to work!

What's up?

If you want to sleep with loads of girls
during Russetiden, then that's totally fine.

But if you think I'm just going to sit at home and wait for you,
then you're wrong.

Where is this coming from?

You're going to be sleeping around.

Okay, then you know more than me.

Yeah, you know what?
Your brother never had a girlfriend.

That he was "terribly depressed"
was just bullshit!

Yeah true, that was bullshit.

So you lied?

Yes.

Why?

Because you were wondering why I behaved
like that in front of my brother.

Then what's the truth?

You don't always tell the truth either.

But that's to protect Vilde.

I do it to protect you.
What's the difference?

The difference is that I don't need to be protected.

Have you asked Vilde if she wants to be protected?

Noora what is this really about?

Do you really think I worked so hard to be together with you

if I was going to sleep with loads of random girls during Russetiden?

Isn't that illogical?

No but... that's not what it's about.

How do I get to know you then?

How can I trust you?

When you don't even want me to meet your family?

You don't need to know my family to know me.

What about your family?

You've never even talked about them.

Oh we can talk about my family!

I am an unplanned only child.

My mom is a sexologist,
my dad is a psychologist.

They never loved me. They were only concerned about
one another and their sex life.

I come from a shit town called Mj√∏ndalen,
and fled as soon as I was 15. Fled to Madrid.

I talk to them once a month.

They are happy without me.
I am happy without them.

I don't have siblings.

I already told you that, so.

Your turn.

I actually have a hard time believing that.

That they don't love you?

That's practically impossible.

It's your turn.

Hey you...

Look at me.

I realise that it may be difficult to trust me.

That I can't tell you everything.

But I don't want to hurt you.

I swear.

If you really want to meet my brother
I'll introduce you to him.

Okay?

Yes.

Maybe that wasn't so crazy.

Are that Chris and Isak?

Isak?

Yeah, he's in the first year.

Okay.

Isn't that a little strange?

I just didn't know they knew each other.

Same.

Nikolai. William's brother.

She's not my girlfriend,
and she's leaving now.

I wonder how many girls William
will sleep with during Russetiden.

You're going to be sleeping around.
-Then you know more than me.

I won't hurt you.
And if you really want to meet my brother...

... then I'll introduce you to him.

I don't think it's you Isak has feelings for.

Is that Chris and Isak?
Isn't that a little strange?

My phone battery is...

It's so bad.
-Yeah I know. Same with mine.

The Riot Club? Isn't that a bit of a weak concept?
-I don't know.

Russ concepts are not really my specialty.

Looks like they had fun at
the release party.

What are you looking at?
-Chris' instagram.

I saw something strange yesterday.

What?

Isak and Penetrator Chris were together.

What? Together how?

No. Isak got into a car
with Penetrator Chris.

Are you kidding?
-No!

Where was that?
-On the right side of school.

Imagine if they're in a relationship!
How crazy would that be?

Yeah but you don't have to be in a relationship
if you sit in a car together.

It's still a bit weird, you know?
-Because it seemed like they were trying to hide it.

Hide what?
-Nothing.

Say it!

Hey, tell me Noora.
Hide what?

Huh?
-Nothing!

Did you tell Eskild about Isak?
-No.

Who is Isak?
-No one.

Eva, don't start.

Don't say anything to Eskild. You don't
know what he's capable of.

Eva. Eskild

Friends!
She's just pissed.

Don't try to come between us.
It's jealousy.

Eva, say it to Eskild.
Cutie!

I can't hold it in!

Okay, we have a friend
who we think is gay.

Who is it?

Isak.

He's always together with a lot of girls
but we found gay porn on his phone.

Eh... he's gay!

Excuse me, you think that everyone's gay Eskild.

I do not.
-You do!

Let me see pictures of him.
Give me some visuals.

I'll find one.

Okay, look at this.

Isakyaki? Okay.

Yeah, he's gay. I chatted with him
on Grindr last week.

Seriously?

I'm messing. He looks sweet though.

Pouty, handsome.

So nice that he's gay!

He isn't gay.
You don't know...

We don't even know if he is.

I'm gonna find out.

Eskild!

You won't find out anything.
You're not a part of this.

I can chat with him if I want to.
You don't own Instagram. Jesus!

Do you know what you've started, huh?

I have to hurry...
for English.

Can't have more absences.

Hurry then.

See you after school?

Tomorrow. I have bus stuff tonight.

Maybe I can stay at your place.

Okay.

What is it?
-I can't leave now.

I have a hard-on,
so we have to stand here for a bit.

Don't be delicious.

It's physically impossible for me
to not be delicious, so..

True.

Say something that will turn me off.

When will I meet your brother?

Before the weekend, maybe.

I got a message from Vilde.

She was wondering if you guys could
party on our bus with us on Friday.

Are you keen?

No.

Why not?

William, I can't be on that bus
with you and Vilde.

Well okay. I have to go.

Don't touch me.

I heard you can get
chlamydia in your eye.

I don't want to..
-Oh, I get it.

I don't want to have
chlamydia in my mouth.

Tell me if you get it,
so we don't spread it.

Maybe we have it in our mouths.
-You think so?

I don't know. From Jonas?

Hello!

What is it?

Your lipstick is just a bit smudgy.

Oh yeah. I just ate, so..

Ate? Ate what? Dick?

Vilde has arranged that we can party on
the Penetrators bus on Friday.

The Riot Club.
-To me they'll always be the Penetrators.

We were talking about
who we want to hook up with.

Who do you want to hook up with?

Eh, no one.
-No...

Noora, it just so happens that we get
to go on the bus.

The situation there is a little different.
It's give and take.

Now Vilde's saying that we're partying
with you guys. You have to stop it.
The situation there is a little different.
It's give and take.

Now Vilde's saying that we're partying
with you guys. You have to stop it.

We have to give something back.

Vilde, that's the dumbest
thing I've heard.

There's no need to hook up with anyone.
I don't have to...

What about Julian? He's kind of your
type. He's the sweetest.

A little bit... feminine?

What are you talking
about now, Vilde?

I'll fix it. You, Noora Amalie Sa√¶tre,
will get hook a up.

No, Vilde!
-I'll fix it, okay?

Yeah, so this is my room.

This is your room?
-Yeah.

Nice.

Thanks.

Remember when you said you
wouldn't have sex before you got married?

Eh, yes. I remember that.

That was really funny.

Yeah, but it wasn't a joke.

No...

No.
-No.

Yeah, same for me.

I think it's cool to wait.

Do you mean that?

No.

Okay...

Eskild! You can't just come into my
room whenever it suits you.

Who's that?

William. Eskild.
Eskild, William.

William, Eskild.
-I see.

What do you want?

I was chatting to that Isak guy.
He's not gay.

Eskild!

What?

Is it a secret that he
isn't gay, or what?

Fucking hell.

She's so uptight.
Can you do something about it?

Believe me, I'm trying.

You need dick, Noora. Dick.

Eskild!

Now I know who you can hook up with.
Maksin! He's so handsome!

Hey you.

Vilde still thinks that we're going
to party on your bus.

And... you have to stop it.

Yeah but the guys are excited about partying
with a Muslim, so it's still on.

Sana?

Yes.

Why?

Why not?

Okay, but you know I can't be on
that bus with you and Vilde.

We know this isn't going
to go well.

Then you'll stay home.

I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.

So what exactly did Eskild say?
I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.

I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.

He just said that he chatted with him,
and that he really wasn't gay.

How does he know he's gay or not?

I don't know. They have their
own language or something?

Did you ask what they talked about?

Eh, no.

I was just relieved that Eskild wasn't convinced,
or he would have started stalking him.

There's Chris.

Oh my god. They're gonna
talk in secret characters.

Did you see that?

Eh, yes!

That was the call-me sign!

That was such an obvious sign!

They're in a relationship.

It's not certain that they are.
-It is! What else?

You know what?

I will try to hook up with Chris
in the bus on Friday.

If he doesn't want to hook up with me,
then I'm convinced.

That's the plan.

Noora, this here is Julian.
He has been in Madrid.

She's a virgin.
Virgin!

Hi. Noora.

So you've been in Madrid, huh?
-Yeah.

Noora! Do you know what happened?

I hooked up with Chris, and his
phone started ringing.

"Isak calling" is what it said on the display.

So then he just pulled away.

Fucking hell, really!

What's going on?

Just stay here.

Okay?

Okay...

You promise?

What are you going to do?

Just stay here.

What's going on?

We have to stay here.

It's the Yakuza guys.

Nikolai. William's brother.

She's not my girlfriend,
and she's leaving now.

If you really want to meet my brother,
I'll introduce you to him.

I know I promised you'd meet Nikolai, but he's
back in Stockholm. You'll meet him before summer.

They were after William,
but he wasn't there.
I know I promised you'd meet Nikolai, but he's
back in Stockholm. You'll meet him before summer.

They were after William,
but he wasn't there.

What's going on?

Just stay here.

It's the Yakuza guys.

What's up with your phone?

Yeah, sorry.
My battery is fucked.

Stroll?

A little stroll.

Do I get a kiss?

How long are we gonna stroll?

Can't we just stop and argue
now? Be done with it.

I don't want to argue.

Yes, you do.

You'll say something like:

You have to stop fighting, William.
Then I'll say:

I didn't mean for you to see that.
You'll say: But I did see it.

I want you to stop.
Me: Fine, I'll stop.

You'll say: Great.
I'll say: Good.

And then we're done with it. Hm?

William... You smashed a bottle
on a guy's head.

In self defense? Yes.

You could have killed him!

Don't you understand how
serious it is?

What's serious is that Yakuza
beats up innocent people.

Someone had to do something.

Someone didn't have to do anything!
You could've talked to him!

Or contacted the police, or I don't know!
Certainly don't respond with violence.

Wow you're naive.

I'm naive?! Because I don't
think violence solves anything?

Noora, violence solves things every day.

The world is driven
by violence and war.

How do you think Norway became
such a free and democratic country?

They had a nice chat with
coffee and cake?

No. There are people who
fought for it. With violence.

How did we defend ourselves
if someone tried to take our freedom?

We solved it with violence.

I can't eh...

I can't be together with a guy who...

... who smashes bottles on
other people's heads.

Don't do this, Noora.

Yeah, but I need a little space.
To think through all this stuff.

I can't think properly
when I'm with you.

Everything just becomes messy in my head.

Okay.

Bit of space.

Slut, slut, slut...

On every picture.

Who commented that?
-allah9753

This weekend?
-After she posted the bus picture.

Is it just because she went to the bus?
-It's not because she was being so slutty.

You were acting like a real nun while
the Riot guys worked for dear life.

Fucking hell, one of the Riot
guys came over to Sana and said:

"Wanna join me in the back of
the bus and sit on my face?"

So Sana said: "Why should I?
Is your nose bigger than your dick?"

Are you kidding?
You said that? To who?

I have no idea. A sexist asshole
who wouldn't take no for an answer.

Vilde, you hooked up a little.

The one time we're on the bus,
a random fight pops up.

But it wasn't random.

It was planned that
they were going to meet.

Isak contacted the Penetrators after
Jonas was beat up by Yakuza.

While we were out partying,
Isak called Chris.

Why did it have to happen the
one time we were on the bus with them?

What happened with him that
he got a wine bottle on his head?

I heard someone filmed
it while it happened.

If they report it,
William is screwed.

It's extreme violence.
That's a prison sentence.

Hey girl.
Hello.

What are you doing?

I'm just writing... or I'm trying to
write an article for Norwegian.

But you can't concentrate on
it because you're only thinking about William?

You... What's the deal?

The deal is that...
I'm really in love with William.

Like... insanely.

Seriously in love.

Don't you ever want to...

...just drink until you're really drunk,
or hook up with people?

Sure.

What makes you not do it then?

My faith is stronger than lust.

It feels much more important
to me than hooking up and drinking.

That's exactly it.

There's nothing that feels more important
to me than to be together with William.

Even though I know there should be.

So why aren't you together with him?

Because he's a bad person.

Why is he a bad person?

First off, he's very controlling.

How?

He tells me what I should feel,
and what to say. What I should do.

And you don't dare
to contradict him?

No, I do. I dare to
contradict him.

But he gets angry
when you disagree with him?

No, he doesn't get angry.

But he argues in such a way that
I can't contradict him.

So... What's the problem?
That he's smarter than you, or?

He tries to change my opinion.

But your opinions only change
when you think he's right.

Yeah, but I'm just trying
to be strong and independent.

I can't... Should I change all my
opinion for a guy, then?

You are strong and independent when you can
change your opinions. No matter what gender changes you.

There's nothing wrong with him
challenging the way you think.

If you are not afraid
to say what you mean...

... then you don't have to be
worried about him controlling you.

But he's violent. He smashed
a bottle on someone's head.

Yeah, okay.

But why did he do it?

Because he has these damn ideas that
the world is driven by war and violence.

We are completely different.

I am against war.

That's not why
he smashed the bottle.

He smashed the bottle because he
was angry and scared. Why was that?

I don't know.

You didn't ask him?

No...

Okay. I think it's interesting that
you're saying you're against war.

War doesn't start with violence.
It starts with misunderstandings and prejudice.

Yeah, so what?

If you say you're
in favor of a world full of peace...

... you have to try to understand why
others think and act the way they do.

You have to accept that not everyone
sees the world the way you do.

You can't just believe that everyone has
the answers to what is right and wrong.

If you haven't even made an attempt
to understand the one you love...

... then I'll be pessimistic
on behalf of the whole world.

You don't have to be with him, but you can't decide
it without even trying to understand him.

Then there's Vilde...

Ah, Vilde.

I'm really scared that
she'll be devastated.

You're underestimating Vilde. She's
the coolest of us all.

She's actually the first one
I would take to war with me.

Just tell her. She'll manage.

And she knows.
That William isn't hers.

Deep down.

Deep down, indeed.

Deep, deep, really deep down.
In the inner cells of her body, there's an atom.

In that atom, there is a proton.

In that proton, there's a small sealed box.

Inside that sealed box, there's another box.

And inside that box, that's where she knows.

Good luck.

But completely serious now, Noora...

If nothing feels more important to
you than being with William...

You have to try to make it work.

It's not certain it'll go well.
It may as well go to hell.

But that's life!

It's impossible to know for sure.

Unless you have a magic
hijab like me. Then you know.

What does your magic hijab
say about me and William?

It says inshallah.

What does it mean?
Is it good or bad?

Impossible to say.
Could go either way.

Okay.

Who would have thought?
Sana has a soft side.

If you fucking tell someone...

Hey Vilde.

Noora? Hi.

What are you doing here?

I have to talk to you.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I'm in love with William.

And he's in love with you?

I think so.

What are you thinking?

A bit relieved, maybe?

Oh?

I thought about why I was
so obsessed with William.

I knew he was just a fuckboy.

I thought I could use him
to just be done with the first time.

But then when we were together,
he wasn't a fuckboy.

He was good, nice, and kind.

That meant something.

It got me thinking that maybe
it meant something for him as well.

Of course I understand that it didn't...

.. .when he said I wasn't good enough.

That's when I was done with him.

It only confirmed that he
never felt something for me.

But then he apologised, and there he was again.
He sent messages and invited us to parties.

That's when I was unsure.

I think it was the uncertainty
that just made me completely...

Crazy.

But now...

Now that you say you're in love...

I don't have to
wonder what he's feeling.

And that's a relief.
If you get what I mean.

Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

All those times you said William was a
selfish asshole that wasn't good enough for me.

Do you think he's good enough for you?

I don't know.

Anyway, I'm really glad
that you told me.

Thanks.

No, of course...

It's not "of course".

You could have tried to kept it a secret.

Pretended there was nothing. Dragged
it out, let me sit there and talk about William...

... and look stupid. While you actually
knew he had feelings for you.

But I did keep
it a secret from you.

I know that.

I was just testing you.

You knew?

Yeah. I've known it for a while.

But I'm gonna continue
working out.

Do you think this body becomes
like this by itself? Huh? No!

It's hard work. This here are squats,
every two days. Every morning at 7.

I'll be done in half an hour. Do you
want to eat lunch at the coffee place?

Hi.

Noora, wasn't it?

Eh, yeah.

Hi.

Is William at home?

Sorry.

Okay. But do you know where he is?

Yeah, where is he?
Training, maybe?

Did you try to call him?
-Yeah, but my phone runs out of power all the time.

I can try to call him for you.

Eh, yeah.

Or do you have a charger?
A phone charger?

Yeah, yeah!

This is Noora. She'll just
borrow a phone charger.

Do you want some wine?
-No thanks.

Something else to drink?

I'm fine.

I actually thought
you were in Stockholm?

Okay... Why?

Because William said so?

William, William..

William isn't very fond
of mixing friends and family, you see.

He's not answering?

Eh, no.

We're in a fight, so...

I can send him a message to find out
when he's coming home, if you want me to?

Eh, yeah. Maybe.
If you want to.

Who's the girl with blonde
hair sitting at the end?

Eh, Mari.

I think she goes to my school.

Yeah, she goes to Nissen.

Did you get a reply?

William's not coming home...

... tonight.

Where is he, then?

Noora, you...
seem like an incredibly nice girl.

And I'm really happy for William.

He's my little brother.

There's nothing I want more than
for him to have a girl like you.

It's just that William
is... complicated.

Complicated?

He used to have
these insane tantrums.

He would hit, or bite. Kick.

He once threatened to push
our little sister out the window.

Mom sometimes had to lock him inside of a room.
She was so scared of what he could do.

He's stopped biting, though

William has always
done as he pleases.

He's good at manipulating people
to get what he wants.

When he doesn't get what he wants,
he becomes extremely destructive.

He doesn't really
care about other people.

If you were wondering why he didn't
want us to meet. This is why.

He's really scared
of being found out.

Perhaps I'm a bad brother
for telling you this but..

I've seen enough good
women like you come and go.

There are girls who believe he's good deep down.
That he's going to be better to them.

I don't know...

You're standing here. Waiting.

While he's out there somewhere
and sleeping with someone else.

Nikolai. William's brother.

She's not my girlfriend
and she's leaving now.

I need some space!

I can't think properly
when I'm with you.

If nothing feels more important
to you than being with William...

You have to try to make it work.

Hi. Noora, wasn't it?

Some girls believe he's good deep down.
They believe he's going to be better for them.

You're standing here, while he's out there
somewhere sleeping with someone else.

Fuck I lost my phone between the bus seats yesterday, and
only found it today. I'm in Lillehammer but it's shit and I miss
you so much. Can we please be done with the space stuff soon?

Love you.

Alcohol poisoning

Drugged?

Rape and sexual assault

Hi. What happened on Friday?
I don't remember anything.

Hi. What happened on Friday?
I blacked out.

What's up? Have you locked your door?
-What is it?

William's outside.

Say that I'm not home.
-That'd be weird since I already said you're home.

Say that I'm sleeping or something.
Or that I'm sick.

He's really insistent. Can't you
just go out and talk to him?

Can't you just find an excuse, Eskild?

Okay.

Are you ok, or?
-Eskild! I...

I just want to be alone, okay?

Is that impossible for you to understand?

Okay, that's fine.

Noora. Noora!
Two seconds.

I have a friend who's a journalist at Aftenposten.
They want an article from a young voice.

I showed him the article
you wrote last week.

He liked it a lot. I suggested
you could write the article.

Isn't that cool?

Yeah... I'm just not sure I can.
If I have time now.

There's a week left. Don't you want
to become a journalist? You have to do this.

Yeah, okay. I can try.
-Cool. I'll e-mail you then.

You tried to call me on Friday?

Wrong number.

Six times?

What's going on?

What's going on is that...

I said I want some space!
I asked for it, you have to give me space.

Whose locker is this?

Sana's.

What does it mean?

Whore.

Fucking hijab police.

They want war,
they'll get war.

Hello sunshine. What's up?
-I'll just have some food.

Should we go see Paradise afterwards?

Was it you who took my fishcakes?

Were those your fishcakes?

For fuck's sake, Eskild.

I can buy new ones in the morning.
I get my salary tomorrow.

I don't need fishcakes tomorrow,
I need fishcakes now!

I would've eaten two
fishcakes at five!

Now I don't have
anything to eat.

I can make something else
that's nice for you...

You can't make something else!

You can't even cook, Eskild!

The only thing you can do... You can't do shit
other than benefiting from other people!

She's kind of right.

What the fuck, Linn?
Are you serious?

Oh my god.

How did the talk
with William go?

I dropped it. I don't think
we fit really well together.

What happened?

We logged into my brother's computer, copied all
the kinky messages with Jamilah, and posted it on his wall.

Are you joking?

What did she say?
-She hasn't said anything.

Did you bring me lunch today?

No, I forgot.

Want to borrow some
money to buy something?

No, no. I'm fine.

Hey, Sana?
-What?

I think we really got ourselves into shit now.

What is it?

Allah9753 commented on a Riot picture:
"Good click yesterday, guys."

What does that mean?

It means the hijab
police is not behind the hate account.

I'm sure it's one
of the Riot guys.

Fuck, it's the asshole
from the bus party.

Eh, Sana?

Oh no.
-They're coming this way.

What do we do?
-Honestly, run!

Huh?
-Run!

Hi Noora. Didn't see your message til now. Nice to hear from you.
Don't worry. Absolutely nothing happened. Just a party. Nikko.

William, we have to go.

William! We have to pick
up the bus in 30 minutes.

What's going on?

We have to talk.

I have to talk.

I know I shouldn't have smashed that
bottle on the Yakuza guy's head.

But there isn't anything
we can do about that now, okay?

He has terrorised half of Oslo
and beat up innocent people.

Including my best friend.

I'm just really angry and
frustrated that they were beaten up.

It was me who Yakuza was really after.
It's me they were going to take.

Chris and the guys are the
only ones who have been there for me.

Because I don't even
really have any family.

You don't?

Dad's a workaholic and mom's going
around taking valium with wine.

My brother is a complete psychopath.

Psychopath?

He's just really manipulative.

That's why I was such an
asshole that morning. In the kitchen.

Had he found out
that I have feelings for you...

He would have
tried to fuck it up.

That's just how he is.

He doesn't tolerate that
others can have something he doesn't.

I've taken a lot of shit from Nico.

That's because he's the only brother I have.
He's pretty much the only family I have.

But if he had tried to
fuck it up between the two of us...

... I would've killed him.

I would've killed him.

I have to be with you.

Say that we should be together.

Don't be so sad.

Fucking hell William,
we have to go.

I love you.

No way! Fucked up! Just found this picture on my phone,
and then remembered EVERYTHING! You were so horny.
Haha! You behaved like a little whore.

Is William home?

Girls believe he's good deep down.
That he's going to be better for them.

You're standing here. While he's out there
somewhere sleeping with someone else.

Fuck I lost my phone between the bus seats yesterday, and
only found it today. I'm in Lillehammer but it's shit and I miss
you so much. Can we please be done with the space stuff soon?

My brother is a complete psychopath.

Psychopath?

Want to pop out to Bygd√∏y and take the first swim of the year?
No, it's not too cold, come on. I'll make cocoa and pick you up in 30.

Don't you have Russ stuff today?

..?

I just mean that you have to remember to have fun in
the last few days! You're only a Russ once in your life.

I want to be with you.

But I'm sick. I think I have a fever.

Okay. Do you need anything?

No thanks. I'm fine.

I'm sleeping.

Ah good, you're awake!

What is it?

We've made breakfast in bed for you...

... to show you that we love you and
to apologise for always leeching off of you.

I'm not hungry.

Yeah, but you can just a eat a little bit.

Eskild, I said I wasn't hungry!

I'm gonna lie down again.

What's wrong?

Is it William?

I just have the flu.

You know you don't have
to face everything in the world on your own?

It's just a fever.

It'll pass.

Okay.

I'll give you two days.

Why do you never answer in the chat? You're coming to the 17th of
May (Norway's Constitution Day) breakfast at my place tomorrow, right?

I have to know what happened last Friday.

Noora! You were so quiet! Meet me.
Then we'll drink beer and talk about it. My treat.

Ok. At a public caf√© in one hour.

Public caf√©? All caf√©s are public.

Please don't hate me...

What are you doing here?

I'm trying to find out why you've
locked yourself inside for three days.

I'm sick.

I'm sick.

Why don't you want to talk to me?

Because it's just... there's just
a few hours of your Russ time left.

You have to... I want
you to go out and celebrate and...

... to have fun with your friends.

You don't have to
waste your time on me.

What's this fuss about Russ time?

Fuck that.

It's not that important.

It's just once in your
life that you're a Russ.

If you don't want to be with me..,

... then you need to
have the fucking guts to say it.

I do want to be with you!

But I have to write an article...

... which I should have handed in yesterday.

I can't write it, because I can't think.
Because I can't sleep!

Do you understand? It's just
because my heart is jumping out of my chest.

No, but I can't breathe!
It feels as if I'm going to die.

You're not gonna die.

I promise.

You're just anxious.

We just have to get
you to relax a little, okay?

No, but I can't relax. Don't you see?

That article is really important.

I have to hand it in.

Noora, you don't have to do anything.

Don't look at me
while I'm sleeping.

Good reply.

You slept for 15 hours.

How do you feel?

NOORA

Okay, world's ... person..

You should be at Eva's 17th of
May breakfast in 30 minutes. I'll drive you.

I can't bear that now.

You're not better off lying here.
You have to go out with your friends.

I found a dress for you.

I can't go in that one.

I wore it to a Christmas ball in the eighth grade.

It's really ugly.

Huh?

No, it's really nice.

Call me if something happens, okay?

You promise?

There's some stuff...

... that I have to find out.

Before I can tell you.

Just tell me when you're ready.

Love you.

I love you too.

Happy Constitution Day!

Happy Constitution Day.

New dress?

Cheers again!
Oh my god.

The 17th of May is my favorite day!

You start the day with alcohol,
you end the day with alcohol.

You spend the entire day with alcohol.

How much ice cream
do you eat during the 17th of May?

How much ice cream?

Ice cream or sausages.
-I eat 15.

15?!
-At least!

I'm not kidding. We have to eat ice cream.
-Krone ice cream?

How many did you eat today?
-Five.

You ate five ice creams?
-Yeah.

The Russ parade is
in like two hours.

I'll wave to many.

Oh! Oh!

Cheers to you.
-Yeah, cheers to you!

Finish that glass.

Should I hand you some food?

No, thanks. I have a
bit of a stomach ache today.

It's so nice that you could all
come to my 17th of May breakfast today.

I love you all. You know that,
that's not why I'm giving a speech.

I want to say, Noora...

Fucking hell, how clever you are.

I thought I should read your article.

As some kind of speech for today.

Youthful freedom and responsibility.

By Noora Amalie Sa√¶tre. 17 years old.

Norwegian youth spend more than four hours a day
on social media, according to a study.

Some believe it's a waste of time,
but I understand why we do it very well.

Society is straightforward on social media.

Where you can just log off,
or block everything you don't like.

Today, we celebrate our constitution.

It says that everyone has equal rights,
and that humas are born free and shall remain free.

Free to be on social media for four hours.

Free to get wasted and fuck around.

Free to use 900.000 for a Russ bus.

Norway isn't the same country as it
was when the Constitution was written.

Norwegian society is constantly developing.

Today, thousands of refugees are
coming into Europe in search of a place to live.

Those are people from a different culture than us.

People whose values we may disagree with.

Some are afraid they
will threaten our Norwegian values.

It would have been best
to have the Facebook function to just block them.

But that's not how it goes.

So, on this day when we celebrate our Constitution...

... we shall remember what we celebrate.

If we believe in the values it is based on...

If we agree with the idea that all people
should be free and have equal rights...

... it is our responsibility to
fight to preserve the values for all people.

It is not there to open doors to
strangers who want to threaten our values...

But it's not to open the doors for them.

We live in a society because we need each other.

People need people.

It can be tiring to deal with others...
Especially the ones you disagree with.

Those who think differently from you.

Whether some are from another culture, or a girl who's
a lame Facebook friend from elementary school.

In a peaceful society with equal rights, we have
to manage to listen to, and try to understand each other.

Perhaps it's easier to understand if we focus on what
we have in common, rather than the differences.

Look for what we agree with,
instead of what we disagree with.

Maybe if we see the worst in others,
it is exactly what they will show us.

We have the right to waste
four hours on social media every day.

Because people before us have
fought for the freedom to do so.

Soon it is us who will take over this country.

It's up to us to determine which
values we live by in the future.

I hope equal rights and freedom for all the people
of this world is a battle we are ready to take on.

Completely seriously...

If not we, who are raised in the
world's most free and richest country...

If not we choose generosity,
patience, and openness...

If not we choose to look for and
believe in the good in each other...

If not we can fight for righteousness...

Then who would be able to do it?

What's wrong?

I think I was raped by William's brother.

Huh?

I don't know... it's possible that
I had sex with him willingly, but...

I don't remember anything.

Did you ask him?

What does he say?

Fucking hell, that asshole!

I swear to God,
if he raped you.

We have to report him.

What is there to report?

I can't report anything
I know nothing about.

I don't know what happened.

Does it feel as if
you've had sex with him?

How would I feel that?

You're a virgin.
You would have noticed it.

I'm not a virgin.

I had sex when I was thirteen.

Thirteen?!

I had a boyfriend who was fifteen.

So, I thought I was ready for it.

Then he dumped me days later.

End of story.

What happened with William's brother?

Tell us everything from the start.

I had to talk to William.

Eva and Chris... you don't know this.

Everyone knows about you and William, Noora.

I went to see William,
but he wasn't home.

His brother was there.

I went inside to charge my phone.

I ended up talking to him.

He just told me lots of shit about William.

I felt really sad.

I drank a glass of wine.

Then I remember nothing.

You were drugged?

I don't know. I never drink alcohol, because I can't
take it. I either feel really bad or I black out.

But, after one glass of wine?

I think I drank a shot, too.

But is there no one else you can ask?
Someone at the party, some witnesses?

Yeah there was a
girl who goes to our school. Mari.

Do you know who she is?

What year?

I don't know, but...

I can't ask her, because...

She seems like a bit of a bitch.

How so?

We have to go to the emergency room.

Huh, no.

They can help us. You
should've gone there long ago.

It's the first place you go!

They can help us find evidence
we can use against him.

Everyone knows that.

You go to the doctor. It's the first place you go. Before
showering, before changing your clothes, you just go to the doctor.

I don't understand
how you didn't know that.

I don't even know if I was raped.

There's no evidence left now.

And there's nothing the doctor,
the police, or the law can do now.

In this free, democratic country we have to believe there are
laws and rules that protect us against assholes like him.

We must believe in justice.

We must believe that the good wins.

Dead serious.

If we don't believe in it...

Who will believe in it then?

Hello!

Hi.

Can we have two beers?

I'm under 18.

So nice to see you!

Thought you were chickening out.

It seemed like you
were a little paranoid in that chat.

I remember very little of that night.

So I'm nervous about what happened.

You blacked out completely.

Yes.

What did I actually drink?

Relax, it was just white wine.

Or tequila? Didn't we drink tequila?

Cheers.

I'm not here to drink beer with you.
I just want to know what happened.

You can have one beer with me, though.

If you never intended to tell me what happened,
I'm just gonna go.

Isn't that a little presumptuous?

It's pretty ballsy to be rude to
someone who has naked pictures of you.

Was that a threat?

Did it sound like a threat?

Yes.
-Yeah well, then it was a threat.

What are you studying in Stockholm?

Eh, international finance.

You should have chosen law.

Okay?

Yeah then perhaps you wouldn't
have been in the situation you are in now.

And what situation am I in now, Noora?

You're in a situation where you'll
be convicted for child pornography.

According to the penal code, paragraph 204a..

.. the penalty for producing and possessing an image that sexualises
a child, is imprisonment for up to three years.

I am under 18, and therefore according
to the Norwegian law, I am still a child.

So those naked pictures you have of me,
that you took without my consent..

Not only is it illegal that you took them,
but also that you stored them in your phone.

So if I were you, I'd be really
careful about spreading them around.

Before it enters another paragraph.

Are you serious now?

Does it look like I'm kidding?

Child pornography?

That's completely foolish.

Tell that to the judge.

You've also threatened me just now.

According to the law about threats...

Paragraph 263, and coercion paragraph 251...

... it's punishable by imprisonment
of up to two years.

Then we're up to five years.

But relax..

They tend to merge verdicts. So we're
talking about maybe two years in reality.

But if you have a good lawyer,
which surely you have...

Then we come to the violations of
the Alcohol Act, paragraph 1 to 5.

Serving alcohol to minors,
on top of it all.

That's something to have on your CV, right?

However, I think the child pornography...

That one has to be the worst.

You know what happens to people in
prison who were convicted of child pornography?

I wouldn't pick up the soap
in the shower if I were you.

To put it like that.

She's your last hope.

Why didn't you talk to her before?

Move on, or talk to her.

What's the worst thing that could happen?

That she says I had sex with her, as well.

It's nothing to be embarrassed
about. I made out with Eva.

The feelings that arise don't
necessarily mean you're a lesbian.

It's a message from Nico.
-What does it say?

Open it.

Nice to see you yesterday. I hope you and
William become happy together.

He told William.

Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

I'll explain everything.

You didn't sleep with him?

I don't know.

Why don't you want to talk to me?

I think I was raped by William's brother.

Is there no one else you can ask?
Someone who was at the party?

There was a girl from our school. Mari.

Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

I don't know.

Yes?

Hi.

Hi.

Are you up for a visit from a friend?

What are you doing?

I'm just throwing
out a lot of shit I don't need.

You had such long hair.

When is this from?

Ninth grade.

Have you heard something from William?

Eva talked to Penetrator Chris,
and he said William has gone to London.

His father lives there.

I'm sure it's just for the weekend.
They have exams next week.

He has to take the exam.

I will talk to Mari tomorrow.

You will?

I sent her a message asking if we could talk.

We'll just cross our fingers hoping she's a little cool.

Just not so cool that
I would've slept with her as well.

What do you want to find out?

Are you hungry?

Eh, no.

I've made something nice for you.

Vilde, I've already eaten.

Do you like tortilla?

What's so good about tortilla,
is that it's made from potatoes.

And your body needs potatoes.

Because potatoes have
lots of starch, which give you energy.

And vitamin C,
which is an antioxidant.

Antioxidants help you
so you don't get old skin.

You don't want to have old skin
when you get together with William again.

Then we need to eat tortilla!

He didn't show up to his exam today. Chris says he
can't reach him either.

What's up?

Hi.

Thank you for wanting to meet me.
-Of course.

You're paranoid about
Nico's party?

Yes.

Don't be. You were just sweet.

Do you know if I slept with Nico?

No.

You don't know.

No, you didn't.

Are you sure?

Yes.

But... oh my god. Okay.

But did I sleep with someone else?
-No.

You were really stressed out, weren't you?

Yeah, I woke up naked!
-You undressed yourself!

I got undressed?!

You seriously don't remember anything?

No! Can you just explain everything now?

Okay. Do you remember
throwing up on the sofa upstairs?

No...

You threw up on the sofa upstairs.
I took you to the toilet.

You threw up again,
so we drank some water.

Then you said you wanted
to lie in William's bed. Remember that?

No...

You were really obsessing over William.

How so?

You said you loved him...

... and that he wasn't good because he was an asshole. You didn't
want to be that girl who falls for such a guy.

You smelled his pillow and said it
smelled like him. You wanted to sleep in his bed...

... and you began to undress yourself completely.

You said last time you were in his bed,
he said that all your clothes would be off within two weeks.

You said it wasn't going to happen,
but that he had meant it.

But that really deep inside
you hoped he was right.

Now he had been right in a way.
Then you passed out.

But I woke up in bed next to Nico.

Yeah, but he came in much later.

But how do you
know he didn't do anything?

Because when Nico came, I was awake. I asked him to go
lie somewhere else. But then he passed out and fell asleep.

But maybe he did
something while you were sleeping.

Noora...

Nico was really fucked up. He wouldn't have even
managed to get a boner.

Just forget it, really.

I would have noticed if
someone had sex next to me.

You didn't sleep with Nico.

I'm totally sure.

But he took pictures of me.

What kind of pictures?

Naked pictures. While I was asleep.

Are you kidding?

I reported him.

Nico, poor guy.

Poor guy? Seriously?

I remember when I was little,
I used to be scared of him.

I'm not scared of him any longer.
I think I just pity him.

But not like that. It was right
of you to report him.

Did you know him when you were little?

I went to kindergarten with Amalie,
his little sister. She was my best friend.

Oh yeah?

I know Nico hasn't had an easy life.
He has a different father than William and Amalie.

His real father never wanted anything
to do with him. Neither did William and Amalie's father.

And their mother is
just really cowardly and weak.

When Nico was little he got
these really sick tantrums. He snapped completely.

Instead of trying to calm him down and
understand him, his mom would lock him in his room.

Music at full blast, so no one would hear him. She went
around smiling nervously and pretending nothing had happened.

It was really intereseting to
have dinner there, so to speak.

After the accident she just
really abandoned both her sons.

Just left them to the au pairs.

I know Nico doesn't have any contact with her.

I don't think William has, either.
If he does, it's not much.

Accident?

When Nico was eleven...

... he stole his stepdad's
car and crashed it into a cliff.

With William and Amalie in it.

It wasn't his intention.
He was just a kid.

But Amalie broke
her back and died.

Fucking hell...

Yeah, it's quite dark.
They were eight years old.

After that, pretty much
the whole family was fucked up.

But William is a good guy.

I understand you think he's an asshole,
but he's actually really sensitive.

He just keeps everything inside.

Does it sting?
-It itches.

It stings when I touch it.

You can't touch it.

That's why you got it.
-Huh?

If you touch there, you get it there.

What are you talking about?
-You can't touch it on your fiffi.

Fiffi?

It's Swedish for vagina.

Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone
is living and sleeping there. There's a mattress, a duvet,
pillows and stuff on the floor. Do you know anything about it?

On (pocketdoctor.com) it says you can get chlamydia in your eye.

No.

Don't touch me!

I promise it's not chlamydia.

I did not sleep with Nico!

But who did you have sex with?
I did not sleep with Nico!

I went to you that night to talk to you...
Nico had a party and said a lot of crap about you, I drank wine and blacked out!

Had sex with?
-Yeah, you said you had sex with him.
I went to you that night to talk to you...
Nico had a party and said a lot of crap about you, I drank wine and blacked out!

I went to you that night to talk to you...

After the party.
I can explain everything. The important part is nothing happened. Please reply. I love you.

I can explain everything. The important part is nothing happened. Please reply. I love you.

Vilde, I didn't say we had sex.
I just said...

... that he fingered me a little
in the taxi. We didn't have sex.

William's at school! He went into
the headmaster's office.

Excuse me, I was just wondering...
Is William...

You haven't replied to my messages.

My phone was dead.

I didn't sleep with your brother.

Can we talk?

I'm moving...

... to London.

Listen up.

William Magnusson.

You're a smart guy.

So you ought to understand...

... that I would never just
let you move to London.

Not before we've talked.

So if you really want to get rid of me...

You should meet me for a talk.

Stop feeling so
damn sorry for yourself.

Okay.

I'll text you.

I'm outside of your apartment now. You
wanted to talk? I don't have much time.

You weren't kidding when
you said you don't have much time.

Plane leaves at six.

You want to talk?

Why do you have to go to London?

Because I want to.

How long will you be there?

I think the rest of my life.

What about us?

What about us?

Is it just over?

Yes.

Just like that?

I'm not in love with you.

You are...

You are in love with me...

That's why you're being so cold.

No, Noora.

I'm cold because that's how I am.

I always wondered why you're so smart.

Just to defend your asshole
behavior to yourself?

You just tell yourself that's how you are?

Is it because your mom is a cunt?

Because you had a tragic childhood?

Is that what you say to yourself? That you feel so sorry
for yourself that you just can't fault your own behavior?

Anyway, it's not true.

People experience horrible things every day,
and they still manage to be nice to others.

Being an asshole is not something
you're born with, or something you become.

It's a choice.

It's also a choice to let
Nico destroy what there is between us.

What's the plan?

Were you just gonna go around London being
an asshole, because your brother is mean?

Because your girl lied to you?

Are you never letting anyone in
again because you might get hurt?

Believe me...
You don't want that.

It's really lonely.

Because people...

... need people.

I love you.

And you love me.

We have to be together.

Tell me we should be together.

I have to go.

Eva?

William has left.

William broke up with me.
William has left to London.

Fuck, he left to...

He came here. We were going to meet.
He came here...

... in Chris' car. He said he wasn't in love with
me anymore, and his flight would leave at six.

No, he said he
wasn't in love with me anymore.

Because he wanted to...
Can I come to you?

He's the most unsympathetic, selfish
person I've ever met.

I would never touch him.

I told you I won't
have sex before I get married, right?

Jesus!

My brother is a complete psychopath.

Psychopath?

Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

I don't know.

You didn't sleep with Nico.
-But he took pictures of me. Naked pictures.

I reported him.

What's the plan?

Are you gonna go around London
being an asshole because your brother is mean?

Because your girl lied to you?

We should just lie here today.

Okay.

What's wrong?

Don't stop.

I need some space, okay?

You don't need space.

Dead serious.

I respect you.

Now you have to respect me.

I had... sex when I was thirteen.

And the guy I had sex with
behaved really shitty afterwards.

So in the spring...
It was not just because of that.

Lots of stuff.

But then I got kind of...

... sick.

So I'm probably just...

... scared that something
like that will happen again.

Hey you...

I'm really damn sorry...

... for what Nico has done.

But it wasn't your fault.

Nothing serious happened,
and he'll be convicted.

Isn't that good?

We have a legal system in Norway.

We just have to trust
that the legal system is fair.

So you don't have to kill him.

You didn't kill him, did you?

I haven't seen him.

I went to London.

Is he in Oslo?

Don't know.

I haven't been to the apartment.

Is it you who has
been living in our basement?

There really is someone
who's living in our basement.

So damn creepy.

I know!

I stayed with Chris.
I'll keep staying with Chris.

You can live here, too.

But you have to...

... go back to the apartment sometime.

I can't meet Nico.

I can come with you.

I'm not scared of him.

Hello?

He's not here.

What do you wanna do now?

Leave again.

Don't you want to be here for awhile?
-Why should I?

You have to take back your apartment.

I can't live here.

You...

You need to give in now. You can't
run from your brother for the rest of your life.

You just have to face him.

You have to look him in the eye
and tell him he's a fucking loser.

Be done with it.

That's not how it works.

I don't know what I
would have done if I had met him now.

Where will you move to?

I'll buy a new apartment.

You have money for that?

It'll work itself out.

So your solution
is to buy a new apartment?

Yes.

Do you want to move in with me?

Say yes.

William...

Can you not for once stop giving a damn about
what's right and wrong, and just do what you want?

Okay.

We'll move in together!

We'll move in together.

Don't stop.

You don't need to.

What's that?

William!

Summons for interrogation.
Friday, 3rd of June. At 3 o' clock.

Why?

Because I smashed a bottle on that
guy's head. There's a video of it.

Why did you guys stop
talking when I came over?

Have you received a letter from the police?

No.

Have you?

We've been summoned for questioning about the
fight on the night of the bus party. They called our parents.

Mom snapped completely.
-Mine too.

Why was I not summoned?

Probably because you left
before the police arrived. They took our names.

They came across the video on the internet.
The police reported the case themselves.

But it's good that you weren't summoned.
It prevents you from having to testify against William.

Will you guys testify against William?

What should we do?
We can't lie to the police.

We can refuse to say anything.

Yeah, we have the right to remain silent.

They can't convict him based
on just that video anyway.

The quality is bad and it's unfocused.

We really have to think this through carefully.
He could go to prison for six months. I Googled it.

This all started when William did something good.
-How so?

In the winter William beat up a Yakuza guy
for calling Iben, Chris' ex-girlfiriend, a cheap whore.

To get revenge he beat up three
Penetrator guys. And William did nothing.

They beat up Jonas. Then Chris and Isak
planned to beat up Yakuza on the night of the bus party.

William didn't know anything about it.

But he ended up having to get involved.

Can't we tell them this story?

I don't think that's how it works. They're only interested
in who threw the bottle at someone's head.

Why did William
smash that bottle, Noora?

Why?
-Yes.

He smashed it because
he felt it was his fault.

That Yakuza beat
up his best friend.

He's extremely loyal
to the people he loves.

So he did it because...

He doesn't trust the responsibility
with adults, because...

There has never been an
adult who has taken responsibility of him.

He also has a little trouble controlling his mind.

It'd be great if you said that, too.

I say we shut our
mouths at the questioning.

I agree.

Okay, let's do it.

Do you think Isak
and Jonas will say anything?

No, it was William who helped them.

Jonas doesn't even like the police.

The only thing that could fuck
up everything, is if the Yakuza testifies against him.

Eskild?

Eskild!

What?

I don't know who you've got
living down in our basement..

But it has to stop. We've gotten
complaints from our downstairs neighbors.

I don't know anything about it.
It's not me.

Is it Tito?
Or Nito?

I don't know anything about it.
It could be Linn.

It's your bedding.

No, it's not.

You know what bedding is mine? Stalker.

Eskild, I'm the only
one who washes bedding in this house.

Had it not been for me,
your bedding would be full of stiff, old cum.

What's this?

Did you just say
stiff, old cum?

Wow!

Way to go, girl!

Dirty.

Eskild, don't change the subject now!

It's because of William.

No, it's not because of William!

Yes, it is. I can see it in you.
You think in a more sexual way.

Good job, William. Applause!
From one guy to another.

He got them juices flowin', Willy!

Fuck, Eskild. Shut up!

Did you guys have sex?

No!

You're gonna have it now!
You're so horny now, help!

Didn't you see the video?

Are you kidding me now?

"Skogtur". On Google. Search for "Skogtur".

You can watch it with William. Foreplay.
-Bye, Eskild.

Stop having people live in the basement.

Eskild!

Yes? "Skogtur"

Say hi to Tito and tell
him to find himself a new place to live.

Yeah.

But let me know if you're going to watch
that video. It's been a long time since I've seen it.

It's quite cool to watch it together.
-Bye!

Who did you get the number from?

Eva got it from Iben who got it from the guy's ex.

Okay. Wish me luck.

Hey you...
-Hm?

Why do you actually
write Noora with two O's?

No one else does it.

Eh, you know Vilde...

Yes. I know Vilde...

Yeah...

She just sent me the
number of the Yakuza guy.

Okay, what are you going to do with it?

No, I just thought that...

... maybe you could call him.

Why should I?

So that you could asked him not
to say anything in the interrogation.

No.

William!

Seriously!

Please.

Forget it.

Yeah but listen!

Everyone is keeping their mouth shut.

Your guys, Isak and Jonas, and my friends. Everyone!

If you don't say anything about everything that happened,
they won't say anything about what you did either.

Noora...

No.

Forget it.

Done.

He refuses to call, so that's fucked.

Seriously? Guys are such idiots. Why does he have to be so proud?
We're talking about six months in prison.

I know

But you can call him...

Do you want to read to me?

Ibsen?

Please?

Why?

Because I'm excited
to hear Ibsen's story.

Story? The story of Ibsen?

Yes.
-The Ibsen of the story?

There's nothing here.
-There's lots of pages here.

Just read 'em.

Read 'em words?

A Doll's House.

A Doll's House?



Who cares?

Three-act play.
-1879.

No...

You're cute.

Yeah, that's true.

Hi. You don't know me, but I was there during the fight on the 29th of April.
I just wanted to say that none of the Riot guys or anyone else who was there
will say anything about what happened. As long as you don't say anything.

Hi. You don't know me, but I was there during the fight on the 29th of April.
I just wanted to say that none of the Riot guys or anyone else who was there
will say anything about what happened. As long as you don't say anything.

We won't say anything.

Hello.

How did it go?

It went fine.

Yeah, but you were there for four hours.
What did they say?

Did you get the impression
they have a lot of evidence against you?

I confessed.

Why did you... You can't...
Why did you do that?

Hell, do I know?
Maybe it's because of what you said.

What I said?! I said you shouldn't say shit.
That's what I said.

The stuff about Nico. That we should
believe in and trust that we have a fair legal system.

I chose to trust it.

Alternatively...

I could have chosen to not trust it...

... and just kept my mouth shut about it.

But then I'd nearly killed Nico.

If you get what I mean.

But what will happen now?

I have to go to court in a few weeks.

I might have to go to prison.

What do you want to do now?
While you're still free?

What do I want to do now?

I know what I want to do.
-What?

What I want to do now,
is to have a really big party...

... where we get completely wasted.

We'll just crawl around.

Okay.

Yeah.
-Yeah.

Where do you think that's gonna happen?
At my place?

We may as well go
back to that damn apartment.

I'm ready to order. If there's someone else
who wants to...

Eva!

You have to meet Isak!
-Hi! Eskild. -Isak.

And Jonas.
-Hi! Eskild.

I live with him.

We live together.
-No, we live in a house with roommates.

We live together.

Jonas talking about Eskild's BJ action.

Huh?
-Yes!

What BJ action?

What day? On Saturday?

No! It was a really long time ago.

I can't remember
everytime I get sucked off.

It's true. If we have fun,
I won't think about it anymore the day after.

Isn't that a good philosophy?

Do your thing!
-Yeah!

Speaking of that jacket...
I know she...

I know she's not the one
who created it, but she sews at the factory.

I met her when I was in Asia.

You look so cool!
-Thank you.

I like that you're standing there looking at me.

You actually hate parties, don't you?

I don't HATE it.

We don't have to be here.

Go to your house and chill?

No. That's not what I want.

What do you want?

Chris. Out.

Are you serious now?

Out. Now.

Bro!

I know I should ask you
if you're ready, but I don't care now.

So shut up.

Oh my god!
Kasper!

Kasper!

Is there no life here?!

I think I did something stupid.

What do you mean?

I sent a message to the Yakuza guy.

I knew you were going to do it.

You're not mad?

I would have done the same.

What will Eskild and Linn
say when you tell them you're moving out?

I'm scared to say it.
You have to say it.

Okay.

My god, it'll go well for sure.

They just have to find
someone else who can live in the room.

Oh, cool belt!

Is it?

Are you taking the credit for that belt?

Is it yours?
-Yes, it's Isak's.

Ah, I see.

All his coolest clothes are actually mine.

SKAM LOVES YOU

I spotted them on Friday.

This is good shit. Fuck!

Both her and Emilie are so hot.

No...

She isn't doable.

Huh?!

What do you think?

I think that she's doable.

Yeah?
-Emilie as well.

Emilie is even better.

What's up with you guys, lowering you standards.

What's up with you?

What are you talking about standards?
You should be much less picky, considering how ugly you are.

Is there not a single hot girl? Not one?

I could've gotten with all the first years.
-There is one!

Listen to me. One!

Short, dark hair. Don't know
what she's called. But she's hot.

She's pretty. I saw her.

The one resembling Natalie Portman?
-Yes, yes, yes. That one.

I don't think you have a chance.

Not in this life, maybe the next one.

I do have a chance!

Last guy she was with was a 20-year-old model.
He was tall and dark. You are neither.

Why should I care about that?

Because then you know what her standards are.

When a girl dates a 20-year-old model,
she won't date another guy like that.

I have a chance.

You have to take the stash.
-No!

I'm too stressed when I have it.
Take it yourself.

I can't have it with me.

Then I'll take it. Jesus Christ!

It isn't yours!

Just let him take it.
-I don't even know him!

Don't know me? What are you talking about?
-It's 1000 kroner!

You know... What the fuck?
You're sitting here smoking it with him.

Of course you know him!

He's in, I'm in, he's in...

Him... I don't know what he's doing.
Just let him take it. I'm really certain.

Thanks.

What would you do without me?

What's going on? Shut the door.

I need to pee.
-Then shut the door right now.

Hello?!

Don't just leave.
I was stuck there with that nerd.

I had to pee.

Your girl.
-It's so boring here.

Hello.

Remember when we were at Sana's place and took some pills?

She was so out of it.
-They weren't blue.

I think they're the same.

Do you know who you look like?

Yes.

The little boy in Stranger Things.

You know! The little boy
who's actually a girl. Eleven.

So damn rude.

No!

She's sweet.
If you're into 13-year-old boys.

Huh? What?
-I'm only kidding!

Seriously. I'm only kidding. I'm sorry.

My name's Isak. What's yours?
-Emma.

Emma? You're really beautiful.

We're leaving.

Do you know how this works?

Let me see.

Zyrtec? Those are allergy pills.

They'll make you tired.

Do you want something that works?
-Do you have that?

Maybe.

I'm leaving.

Uh yeah. We'll check if there's some food around here.

Really nice, Isak.

Hey...
-Hey, what?

Emma, Yousef is here.

Have you seen Eva?
-No.

Hi.

Where are you going?
-Home.

You're going home? Over the fence?
-Yeah.

Everybody else has gone through the gate over there.

Do you have some ID on you?
With your name etc.

Bank card? Driver's license?

No.
-Nothing?

What's your name?
-Adrian Eksett.

Adrian. How old are you?
Wait a minute.

Yes? Answer.

Mamma, Exodus 20:4

Do you still have our stash? Call me when you wake up. Police found
some stuff at Eva's place. She's really mad and thinks it's mine.

Pick up your phone then. Sorry I had to hide it at Eva's.
But it's not possible that they found it because I hid it really well.

Promise I'll fix it. Call me.

Isak! Hey, he's awake.
With morning wood straight up.

Look! Devil's cave is what I call it.

Want to say hi?
Hi, good morning!

Did you sleep well?

Say hi.

Hi.
-Say hi then!

Hi!

He's a bit crabby and tired.

Hi Isak!
-Hi. Hi, Noora.

Piss off, Eskild!
-Relax!

What are you guys doing today?
-Relax, I think.

Yeah. Relax.
So nice.

I'm going to sell my Warhammer collection
on the flea market. No, I'm kidding.

I'm going to the supermarket to buy fish cakes. Kidding.

I'm going to fill up a big can with
Fun Light and watch a movie. With Linn.

Ah, so nice.
-Yeah.

We'll snuggle up together.

What are you going to do?

I don't know. I'll just find something.

Something like what?

William's working, so I just have to...
I don't have that many friends yet.

What I think, Noora.. .
You are in London. Best city in the world.

I know! I'm having a lot fun!

I'll have lots of fun today.
Or I'll go to a museum.

You're going to a museum?
-Yeah!

Don't go to a museum, Noora. Do something fun!
Don't go to a museum and be boring. Do something fun.

Go to a club. Get some drinks.
-Yeah, relax.

I'm having lots of fun.
-Yeah...

I want you to be doing well, Noora.
-Yeah, really well!

So what's it like living with Isak?
Is it all right?

He doesn't pay rent, you know?
-I will pay.

And he smells like farts. Guy farts.

While you smell good.
You smell like delicious lavender.

Love you.

...I hooked up with a girl of who I legitimately thought had a cat tongue.

I'm not sure if it was a tongue, or a fake tongue.

Fake tongue?!

Like making out with a cat.
-Have you kissed a cat?

No, but it was really small and thin.
-Cat size?

I didn't see her tongue, but...

You know that party at Johanna's?

I hooked up with a chick there.

The blonde one?
-Yeah, the blonde one.

She didn't have a clitoris.

What?!
-Yeah, I swear. She didn't have it.

How do you know?
-I saw it.

Dad: Hi Isak. Do you want to have dinner with
me on Wednesday night? Hug from dad/

I saw it! I know where the clitoris is.
And I saw it when I went down on her.

I need money for my rent. 4000 Kroner

Are you joking?
I need money for my rent. 4000 Kroner

I need money for my rent. 4000 Kroner

No...
-You went down on her?

Yeah.
-You go down on chicks?

Why are you so surprised? You don't?

Eh, no!
-Why not?

I don't know. Should we go down on chicks?

Why the fuck...

Because they love it. Why do you ask?
-Do you also go down on chicks?

Isak?

Hi!

Do you guys perhaps want to join the theatre this year?

Don't really know.

We are group leaders of the ‚Äúkose‚Äù group.
(kose = a good vibe/feeling/atmosphere)

We want to have you guys!

Kose group? What does a kose group do?

We make sure there's a good atmosphere.

We spread love, bake bread, we cook.

We have a group meeting next Friday.
Maybe you guys want to come?

Friday...?

No. I don't really know. It's Friday, you know.

But you're second years.
You're neither third years nor first years.

You guys should make yourselves known
socially to avoid becoming completely anonymous.

Do you guys want that?
To walk around being a nobody?

Eva!

Did you see my messages?
I forgot my sweater at your place.

Yeah, I saw. I'll look for it.

No, but I have to come get it
at your place because I know what it looks like.

Can't you just describe it?

Yes. I can.

It's black‚Ä¶

Okay... A black sweater. Got it.

Let us know if you want to join!

Yeah, we'll do that.

Bye.

A sweater?!

What's up?

I had to hide the shit at Eva's place.
-Are you kidding?

I'll fix it.
-That's 1000 Kroner.

Mahdi, I'll fix it.

Was it not good?



Ask first. Cat guy.



Hi.
-Hi.

I have your drugs.
-What?

The stuff you left at Eva's place.

I have it.

You have it?

If there's one thing I don't like,
it's when someone fucks over their friends.

What do you mean?

Eva could've been in a
lot of trouble if they had found it.

Could have... but they didn't find it.

They didn't find it because I took it.

Okay, I'm sorry for leaving it there.
Thanks for taking it, but it's not even mine.

I should get something in
return for rescuing it from the police.

Do you think this is a fucking
Narcos episode or something?

Can't you just give it to me?

I want 10% of your drugs.

Do you use then?

No, but it's great to have.

I also want you and your
friends to join the kose group.

Kose group. That's the best theatre group of them all!

Okay.

Whatever. We can join the kose group.

So then you'll give it to me?
-Yes.

So just give it to me now.

Do you think I'm dumb? You get it
when I see you and your friends at the group meeting.

Sana and Isak can work together.

Huh?! No, I'm not sitting here.

Can't you work with Isak? It'll be fine.

Guys and girls can work together.

We do that in Norway.

Hi! Welcome!

Where the fuck are you guys? I can't be
bothered to sit here by myself, it's your shit.

Chris!
Where the fuck are you guys? I can't be
bothered to sit here by myself, it's your shit.

Chris!

Can Kasper join the meeting?

Kasper doesn't go to this school though.

Yes. That'll be fine.
Right Vilde?

It's quite unhealthy that
they're together every single second.

Hello.
-Hi!

So nice that you wanted to come.

Yeah just find a seat,
then we can start.

Some bread? I baked it myself.

Cool. Looking forward to it.

Sorry man, I have to help my mom
with something. I'll come as soon as I'm done.

Fuck was that today

Hello.
-Hello.

Kose group, yay!
-Yay...

We looked at the group list during break.
Where are the awesome people of this school?

Kose group, of course.

Cool.

Hi and welcome.

We are overjoyed that you
guys are here today.

You guys can introduce yourselves.
This here is...

Eva.
-Sana.

Vilde!
-Vilde.

So I thought I'd explain
what kind of vision we have.

We have our group meeting 3 weeks before
the others because we are an important aspect of the theatre.

More than, for example, PR or costumes.

We thought it's best to have
a good system throughout the entire theatre event.

That's why we'll divide you into groups.

Or duos, so that you'll be in pairs.

Then it's not a group, but a duo.

You guys will divide the days between yourselves.
That's what we'll be doing.

So that... I'm a bit nervous!

So that you will pair up and
someone will cook every day.

It's really important in the kose group that
you spread a lot of good vibes, and love.

Spreading love is not something
that comes naturally to everyone.

So I thought we could all do a love exercise.
If everyone can get up...

If everyone can stand in a circle here,
then we'll grab each other's hands.

Do you also need tissues?

Come outside.

You know the group leader?

Vilde?

With the love game?
-What was that?

I had to bail. I can't be bothered
with that stuff. What happened?

She got us to go and feel eachother in a dark room.
If you walked into a dick, you had to suck it.

No?
-No!

What class are you in?
-3STB

You didn't go here before?

No, Elvebakken.

You transferred in your final year?

Hey you.

Hey.
-Hi.

We're setting up the cooking system.
We should be in pairs.

I don't know that many people.
Well I know Maria, but she's going with Lea.

So that's why I was wondering
if you want to be in a group with me.

I thought we were in a group together.

Yeah, I had in a way already
agreed to be in a group with...

With...
-Even.

Emma.

I'm sure we can be in a group of three.

I think she said we should
be in pairs, but I don't care.

It seemed like Vilde was
really clear on wanting pairs.

Can't you just ask?

Yeah, okay. Then we'll do that.

Yes, we'll do that.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

Can I have a drag?

Thanks.

I'll just take it then, Jesus Christ.

What would you guys do without me?

I want 10% of your drugs, and I want
you and your friends to join the kose group.

Yeah just find a seat,
then we can start.

Come outside.

So that's why I was wondering if you wanted
to be in a group with me.

Yeah, I kind of already agreed to
be in a group with...

With...
-Even.

Hello again.

Hi how's it going?

Horny, you?

Location?

Look at this guy.

Do you think he's handsome?

This guy.

I don't fucking know.
-Look!

Definitely handsome.

Isak, you can say a guy's handsome without being gay.

I said he's definitely handsome.

I'm going to meet him, you know.

You need my confirmation that he's hot before you meet him?

He writes that he isn't gay, but likes to suck cock for fun.

My boy, you have one year and then you'll be out of the closet.

Eskild, why do you think every guy is gay?

I don't think every guy is gay, Isak.

But I have quite a good gaydar.

You know?

How does this gaydar work?
What's the characteristic of a gay guy?

Okay.

A clue, for example, is when someone
starts talking about sucking dick with a stranger.

Right?

It's also a bit suspicious
when you have a Grindr profile.

Hi!

Noora.

I'm in Isak's room.

No, it's better now. He's cleaned
up a little. However, it smells‚Ä¶

Yo, what's up people?

Straight out of Elvebakken.

Today I'm talking to my best buddy Even.

What's up, bro? Tell us about your movie.

The movie is about Captain America and Vladimir Putin

who are in love with each other.

But they can't be together because
Sarah Palin has bewitched them.

So when they kiss, a cat dies of AIDS.

Who is this Barbie? Sarah Palin?

No! She's just Barbie.

You always have to have a hot woman.

Sarah Palin is considered a hot woman.
-What?!

Who's your favourite director?

Baz Luhrmann.

Seriously?
-Seriously.

Are you kidding me?
-No I'm not kidding you.

Baz Luhrmann?
-Why are you so skeptical?

He makes clich√© movies where the leads die.

He makes epic love stories, man!

The lead must die,
otherwise it's not an epic love story.

Hello.

Do you have my stuff?

What stuff?

What stuff?!

I thought you said it wasn't yours.

Can't you just give it to me?

I didn't see your friends at the meeting.

I can't force them to come, can I?!

Control yo hoes, is all that I'm saying.

I can't be bothered with this anymore.
-Neither can I.

Where do you want it?
-You have it?

No! The big compartment.

Sana and Isak! What are you guys doing?

What was it you put in your burqa just now?

My burqa?
-Niqab, then.

Niqab? You can't name the
garment 10% of your students wear?

Are you a racist?

What's it called then?
-It's called a hijab!

Great. Hijab.
But now you guys need to pay attention.

Please, class starts now.

Vilde?

Hi!

I was just thinking, are there
any more kose group meetings?

How unbelievably nice that you're engaging!

We won't have a group meeting this week,
but next week there's the theatre party.

So we'll have a group pre-drink.

Could the pre-drink maybe be at yours?

Why?

Because my mom is hosting a wine
reception, Eva's house was completely trashed

and Sana's parents are Muslim.
But it could be at yours!

Maybe...
-What's up here?

Isak will throw next week's pre-drink.
Do you guys want to come?

Eh, group pre-drink?

What the fuck‚Ä¶

Why are you laughing?
Do you think the theatre is stupid?

The theatre will lay the social
foundation for how you'll be at school if you engage.

That's where class, age, race, sexual orientation...

Hi!

Did you get my messages?

Sorry. No I didn't get them.

We'll have a pre-drink on Friday.
We were wondering if you guys want to come.

Friday?

I don't really know. I think‚Ä¶
-Isak has brain damage. We're coming.

Okay, yeah. Cool. I'll text you.

What the fuck is your deal?
Are you gay or what?

Where do these first
year girls get the confidence?

Why are first year girls inviting second year guys to a bus pre-drink?

Are they complete noobs?
They're not meant to go after you?

What's the problem with that?

The problem is that there's a system!

If first year girls start sleeping with third
year guys, and second year guys as well...

Who will we sleep with?

I'm available if you want to have sex.

Don't be rude.

Dude, you're such an idiot.
-What the fuck did you mean by that?

Is she playing me, guys?

I'm so damn hungover.

It's Wednesday...

You always have to have a hot woman.

Sarah Palin is considered a hot woman.
-What?!

Who is your favorite director?

Baz Luhrmann.

Seriously?

Horny?

Hi. Top or bottom?

Is your cock thick?

Squirt a lot?

You can fuck and
come in my ass.

You owe me a drink. Yeah.
-Huh?!

That party Ina and Hedda had together...

...You drank almost all of my six pack.

It's you who owes me.
I gave you like three beers at a party.

That was ages ago!

At that one party you didn't have shit,
and I had a six-pack.

You almost finished the entire fucking six pack.

When I came up to you, you gave me some.

Why are you saying it's true?
-He gets it!

It goes without saying.

Eskild will get it for sure.
-Eksild? Eksild will get it.

Later, guys!
-Text me when we're leaving.

I'll find out.
-Bye!

Are you home and can you buy beer for me?

Sorry, working until 9PM

Hello.

Hello.

Going home?

Yeah.

You too?

Nice chat...

This is line 12 via. Gr√ºnerl√∏kka
and Torshov to Disen.

You're 18, right?

Could you maybe buy some beer?

I forgot my ID.
I have to go home and get it.

You coming?

Hello?

Nice.

Don't know where I've put it.

Did you draw these?

Yeah.

They're good.
-Thanks

Really funny.
-You think so?

Here it is.
-You found it?

No, but...

Haven't you skipped school yet?

I just skipped class earlier.

You didn't get caught yet?
I skipped a few hours.

What's the limit?
-The limit is 10 hours.

But if the principal likes you it's 15.

Really?
-Yeah.

But I don't think the principal likes me.

What do you listen to when you listen to music?

I'm quite a big N.W.A. fan.
-That's what gets you going?

That's what you listen to
when you want to feel though.

Have you listened to anything from Nas?

Nas?

Are you kidding?
You haven't checked that out?

I've listened to it. Nas. Nas?
-Nas?

Have you even heard of it?
-I have heard of it!

It doesn't sound like it.

I've heard of it...

You should listen to it later.

That there is a sweaty cheese, man.

I know, I forgot about it
when I went to school today.

It has almost melted.

Has that happened to you before?
-Yeah, I always forget the cheese.

You do that too?
-Yeah.

Fuck, that's a problem.

Cheese and keys. Especially cumin cheese.
(Word play on n√∏kler = keys, and n√∏kkel = cumin)

Those are the things I forget most.

Beer?

There you go.

Cheers.
-Cheers.

So, what kind of spices do
you want? Let's start with...

Caribbean Jerk Barbecue.
-Caribbean Jerk sounds perfect! Go ahead!

Chili?
-Chili? Always chili.

Rosemary?

Rosemary? Yes, loads.
-Loads of rosemary? Okay.

Let's do this.

Even more?
-No, this is great.

Pottagaldrar?
-Pottagaldrar? Eh, yes!

When should we be at Emma's?
Did you get beer? Answer.

Hi we'll start the pre-drink at 7PM. Maria lives in Torshov,
just call when you guys are outside the 7-eleven,
I'll come out to meet you. When are you guys coming?

My friends are also wondering if you could bring
some of the stuff you gave me in the bathroom
at that party. Only if it isn't much trouble.

Cinnamon?

Yeah, fuck it!

I think it's gonna taste like balls.

But we can't go back now.

No, we can't go back now.

Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.

I'll just put a little bit more pepper.
Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.

Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.

Sorry we forgot some other stuff we were doing,
but we'll join another time.

Should we put it in the oven?

Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

There's something that doesn't taste right in there.
-It's absolutely terrible.

So bad that it was good in a way.

No, it's so bad that it's even worse.

It was you who wanted to use all the spices.

A lot of cardamom is essential.

Is that the trick?
For it to be good?

Have you heard rumors about my rapping?
-I actually have.

Come on! Focus!

What time is it?
-Ten to eight.

I've invited a few friends.
But just stay. We have lots of beer.

Hi.
-Introduce yourself.

Hi. Elise. Nice to meet you.
-Isak.

And this here is Sonja. My girlfriend.
-Sonja. Nice to meet you.

Isak.

Your girlfriend became the saleswoman of the month.
-Really? What?!

You're so smart.
-Yeah, yeah.

You must be quite proud.

Why are you lying?
Talked to Emma and her friends.

What are the characteristics of a gay guy?

We'll have a pre-drink on Friday.
We were wondering if you guys want to come.

I don't really know.
I think...

Isak has brain damage, you know?
We're coming.

Text me when we're supposed to be there.
-Yeah, I'll figure it out.

Hello.

And this here is Sonja, my girlfriend.
-Sonja.

Isak.

Why are you lying?
Talked to Emma and her friends.

Hi. I just want to say that we talked to your friends and know
that you didn't have other plans. If you're not interested, that's
great, but you don't have to give me false hope by saying you're coming
to the pre-drink when you aren't, that's really asshole-ish.

Hello?! Is it so hard to answer!?!!

Sorry that I called you an asshole.
It's possible you have a good reason, but can you answer?

ASSHOLE!

Hello.

Hello, traitor.
-Hey man.

Traitor?! Fuck.
-That was dumb of you.

You just betrayed us.
What's up with that?

Yeah, sorry man.
Yeah...

It was just really stressful.
-Stressful? What do you mean, stressful?

I'll arrange a new pre-drink, okay?
-Yeah, but what kind of stress?

There was just something with my mom.
-Your mom? What's up with her?

She's stressed out.
-She's stressed out?!

My mom has been stressed ever since
I arrived on this earth, and you're talking about stress?

Huh?

How's it going with her?

She's fine.

Just arrange a new pre-drink.
Case closed.

Case closed.

Closed.

Mamma: Corinthians,6:11

Hi!
-Can you hold this?

I will be sending out invites‚Ä¶
I wanted to ask you if we can have the pre-drink a bit earlier?

No. I won't be having a pre-drink.

Why not?

I can't because I live with other people and
they don't want to have a pre-drink.

But I talked to Eskild and he said it was completely fine.

Of course he said that. But I talked to Linn,
and Linn does not want to have a pre-drink at ours.

Honestly though Isak, what does Linn want?

Linn doesn't want anything.
Linn is deeply depressed.

You should take responsibility
and make her socialise a little.

Take responsibility!

You're hosting that party, Friday at 6.

Hi!

I was wondering...

I need advice, so to speak.

Because there's this really sweet girl in the first year

and I managed to make her quite angry.

She has a good reason to be,
because I fucked up a promise.

That wasn't nice.

That's why I was wondering,
do you think I should go and shoot myself?

Or perhaps she'll forgive me?

It'd be cool if she does it in 20 years.
As long as she does it sometime.

Jerk.
-I'm a jerk?

You think I'm a jerk?

Fuck, then there are two girls who think I'm a jerk.
She's sweet, and then you.

Oy, did you just try to kill me with that look?
Was that what you were trying?

Am I really such a jerk?
You think?

Good job!

We want six dancers for the theatre.

You'll get an answer within the week.
Thanks!

Show's over, guys.

Really good. So good! Wow.

Did he need to be so gay?
-Huh?

You didn't notice?
-He was ultra gay.

What's up with you dissing people who are gay?

I didn't diss him.
But you could see it.

Yeah, but you're just pointing
out that he's gay or what?

Really great observation, Isak.

What's up with you? You're being so pissy.
-With me? Huh?!

Me?
-Yeah.

You're the one who's fucking grouchy about everything!
-Grouchy?

Ever since we walked into
the classroom, you were...

What the fuck are you talking about?
-Hello.

You forgot this Friday.

Is it yours?

I think it's mine.

Forgot where?

In the cafeteria.

Who's that dude?
He's just some theatre nerd from Vilde's group.

Oh fuck! My dream yesterday. Fuck!

Vilde was in it. She was some dominatrix, SM chick
who punished me with sex because I hooked up with a first year.

Sickest dream I've ever had! So wild.

Dominatrix? What are you talking about?
-Dominatrix‚Ä¶ I don't know what to call it.

What did she do?
-She was the boss. I didn't do anything.

Black clothes?
-Yeah!

Whip and everything.

So sick.

You have a weird imagination.

What kind of music do you like?

That's difficult.

My favorite music is Justin Bieber!

Oh my god.
-Was that bad? Oh no!

I'm getting a headache.
-You get a migraine from Justin Bieber?

A chronic Justin Bieber migraine.

I can't leave. I live here.
Could you leave?

You're throwing me out because I like him?
What kind of music do you like?

I'm more into 90's hip hop.
Do you know anything about it?

Eh, no.
-You don't know anything about it?

I do...
-Nas?

Nas? Have you heard of him?
-Huh?!

He made the best album of all time.
Illmatic. Have you heard of it?

Ill?
-Illmatic!

Ill as in sick. And Matic.

Hi! So nice to see you. Hi.

Vilde. Nice to meet you.
Sonja.

I don't know if you know this but...

Do you feel this strap here?

You feel it?
-Yeah.

It sticks out just under my arm.

It will be like that until I get home.

You should be happy you're not a girl.

It's really annoying to be a girl.

Especially when-

I'm starting to think you're bonding too much.
-Finally! Hello!

Kose group!
-Cool apartment.

Thanks.
-It's so cool here. Sick.

It's a shared apartment. There's always
cool people here. Like Eskild!

Have you met Eskild?
-No, I don't think so.

He's gay. He's really sweet.

I love gay people. They're sweet.

You don't think that's a bit of
a superficial generalization?

How so? By saying gay
people are funny?

That's like saying all muslims are terrorists.
-What?!

No, that's too much.
It's not like that.

To be funny is really positive.

To be a terrorist is really negative.

That's not what I'm saying, but you are
generalizing. Not all gays are funny.

This is really boring.
Isak, come dance with me

People! We have ordered 4 taxis.
And we have to go now!

Who took my phone?
Who used my phone to play music?

Does everyone have their tickets?
The tickets are really important.

Can someone call me?
Please. I can't find my phone.

Isak! Me, Sonja, and Even
are taking a taxi together.

Do you want to come with us?
-No, I'm cycling.

Yeah, okay. Fine.

Didn't you take a taxi with the others?

I have a bicycle.

Were you having a good time with Emma?

She's something.

Do you know me and Sonja have been
dating since she was 15 or something?

Okay.

I'm noticing that we're growing
apart more and more.

But I can't dump Sonja.

Okay.

If I dump Sonja, she'll think
it's because she has an aluminum leg.

Huh?
-You didn't know?

Aluminum leg?
-Yeah, her entire foot was amputated.

What? How did that happen?

She stepped on a land mine in Tj√∏me
when she was nine years old.

Shit.

It was quite bad.
-I didn't know.

But it's going better with her now.

She's gotten really good help from...

What's it called? A physiotherapist.
They've helped with her motor skills.

You know aluminum technology has come a long way.
You can hardly see that she limps.

You're joking?

You're joking? Yeah?
Fuck!

How can you joke about that?

You think there are land mines in Tj√∏me?

I don't fucking know!
You can't joke about something like that!

I could've joked about
something way worse!

No! That's a very serious
thing to be kidding about.

I could've joked about a dick.
That would've gone too far.

Dick...

Too far.

I don't think aluminum technology was ...
-Was that what betrayed me?

But...

She's sweet.

Sonja.

The global mentality is moving toward
free world trade and increased market liberalism.

A world full of opportunities.
A world where dreams can come true.

It sounds fantastic,
and it is fantastic.

For a very small percentage of us.

But for the vast, poor majority, the capitalist
system only means one thing: death and suffering.

While we live out our days thoughtlessly,
and stuff ourselves with cheap food..

.. the poor people of the earth struggle
in factories.

Wages are forced down to the minimum,
while the work hours keep increasing.

Unionization is illegal,
and the working conditions are intolerable.

Before applauding freedom,
we must remember one thing:

Our over consummating society stands
on the shoulders of the coffee beans from Peru.

We gorge on cheap food produced
by underpaid children's hands from India-

Was it good?
-So good!

Should I change the title to:
Working conditions are inhumane?

No, it was good the way it was.
-Yeah?

Are there other things you thought of?

You know you wrote
"gorge on cheap food" twice in a row?

Maybe you could change that.

No, that's the point.
To write it twice.

I use repetition as a
literary tool to emphasize...

Was it good?
-Yeah, that was good.

Cleverly written.

I got a 5.

5+? Nice. Really good!

Eva, what did you get?

I don't want to talk about it.

The thing is, is that Jonas is your boyfriend.
So you have to tell him everything,

and Jonas tells me everything.
So I'll know anyway.

It's true.

Okay, yeah.
I got a 4 minus.

You got a 4 minus?

That's bad.
-Yeah, yeah. You're good a a lot of other things.

You're able to dress yourself,
you can brush your teeth by yourself. Think of that.

Jonas, we're leaving.

Now?
-Yeah.

Where are you going?
-To Elias.

I'll call you later.
-Okay.

Phone is turned off...

Hello!
-Hey!

What's up?
-Nothing special, really.

Are you with Jonas?
-No, not now.

Weren't you going to Elias?

Yeah but that was a while ago.

Did you see Sara's picture?
I think she got fake lashes.

No!
-Yeah, check the picture on Facebook.

Have you heard they
started their bus already?

No.

One month into high school
and they started their bus.

With who?

With Rodrigues maybe,
they're calling themselves Papsi Max.

You know you can
just talk to her, right?

She doesn't bite.

Jonas is here.
I have to go.

What are you gonna do?

I tried to call you,
but you never answered your phone.

My battery was dead.

Can't you just charge it at home?
-I wasn't home.

Where were you then?

I was at Elias'.

Until now?

I talked to Isak. He said
you guys left Elias' a long time ago.

So many questions!
Isak left, I stayed.

Don't you trust me?

Don't you trust me?

Huh?

Why don't you trust me?

3+? You said you got a 4 minus!
-It's almost the same.

"Whoever has expelled..."
-Jonas!

"... must be blamed for their behavior."
-Jonas!

"A state one experiences"?
That was really sweet.

What do you think you're doing?
-A kiss.

What's your name?
-Ingrid.

Are you guys in the same class.
-1STA, yeah.

It costs 10 Kroner per ticket.

It'll be good.
Are you guys excited?

Hi!

Will you be at the show?

We're from the theater
group, and we want to have you!

What do you do at the theater group?

We have a pre-party tomorrow.
Are you going to the party?

You have to, everyone will go!

You're a first year. This is when you'll
lay the foundation for your social future for the next three years!

Wake up!

But if you want to be at
the pre-party, add me on Facebook.

Argentina etc.

I don't think anyone actually likes him.

When the teacher asks obvious questions...

Hey you...

Can't we go to the party?

Why?

Because the entire school is going.
And we are first years.

This is when we have to
lay the foundation for our social life.

Foundation for our social life?

Come on! It'll be so much fun!

I promise.
-Yeah okay, I'll come.

If... Isak can come
to the cabin next week.

I know it was supposed to be just the two of us,
but Isak has nothing to do.

He'll just walk around,
completely by himself.

You can take a friend as well.

What do you say?

Okay, Isak can come.

Come to what?

The cabin, man!

Cabin? I'm going to the cabin?

On one condition..

That you guys come to the party tomorrow.

We can't.

Why not?

Kindred Fever tickets.

I completely forgot!

Seriously, I didn't even remember it.

Hi! You came!

You can't ignore me forever.

We're bound to talk.

Ingrid...

I miss you.

Say something.

I would've lost the eyeliner.

You look like a slut.

She snapped.

NOORA

We have Spanish together. Noora.

Eva.

Girls who call other girls sluts
have 90% higher chance of getting chlamydia.

Seriously?

No.

But it would've
been cool if it were true.

Are you okay, or?

Yeah... Yeah.

Are you sure?

Maybe...

Maybe I can get a friend?

Can you maybe get Chris?

Chris?

It was 40.000 Kroner.
I don't have that money!

It's toilet paper, Vilde! Toilet paper!

It's not that bad.

We're not going to use
that much toilet paper.

I don't mean to interrupt,
but I got Chris for you.

Here I am!

This is Chris.
-I am Chris.

Are you also called Chris?

Oh my god!

Twin names!
-Yeah, twin names!

We were actually in
the middle of something...

Yes, of course.

Come, we're going.

What happened?
We're not going to talk?

You! Where are you going?

Don't be a dick tease.

Hi.

Hi friend.

Are you in Oslo now?

No, my flight from Geneva is
booked so I'm here until tomorrow.

No...

But I'm in Oslo tomorrow afternoon.

But I'm going to the cabin tomorrow.

Oh yeah, that's true!

Where was it you're going?

To Ingrid's cabin,
with Igrid and Sara.

So nice! Who will drive you guys?

No, we'll take the bus.

The bus? Can't you wait?
If you wait a day, I can drive you.

But I've been looking forward
to the cabin for over a month.

Yeah, I know.

But I'm coming home on Saturday.

Yeah... On Saturday I-

It looks like I'll
leave again on Friday night.

Do you have enough money?

Yeah.

I'll wire you a little bit extra,
so you guys can have fun.

Thanks.

Okay, have a good trip
and say hi to Igrid and Sara.

Yeah, thanks. You too.

Okay, we'll talk.
-We will. Take care!

Sorry, sorry!
-Isak!

Should we send him home?
-Okay, we'll just do that.

What time is it even?

Eh, ten past nine.
-Ten past nine?!

Why did you come so fucking early?

Play "I'm Yours".
-No!

You only know gay songs.
-Shut up! Is that a gay song?

Who is it?

Jonas?

Elias.

Your new lover?

What are you talking about?

You know what I'm talking about.
You ran after him the entire school day.

Hello?

Oh, Elias? I'm so happy to be talking to you.
I think I love you.

Maybe we can get married. Then we'll go on our
honeymoon in March and live alone for the rest of our lives.

Love each other.

What's the deal with Jonas and Ingrid?
-Huh?

You heard what I said.

You have to ask Jonas.

Why do you ask?

I saw a notification on his phone.

I know that you know something.

Can't you just say it?
I promise I won't get angry.

I promise I won't
tell Jonas you said something.

They text?

Maybe a little.

In which stadium does the
English Cup Final take place? -Wembley.

That's correct.

What bone in your body
gets broken most often? -Collarbone.

Yep.

Who was the first
president of the USA?

George Washington.

Okay, Eva. Who was the
first female Prime Minister of Norway?

I'm not joining.

She can't answer.

I do, I just don't want to join.
-Just answer, then we won't nag anymore.

I didn't hear the question.
-Who was Norway's first female Prime Minister?

Erna Solberg.

Fuck you guys!

Why are you so pissed?

I'm not pissed. I just think
Trivial Pursuit is boring.

Okay?

What do you want to play, then?
Something that isn't so boring.

Nothing. I want to read.

Come on! You must
want to do something.

Okay.

I want to play "My ship is loaded with.."
-Then we'll play "My ship".

I'll start.

My ship is loaded with Ingrid.

My ship is loaded with Erna Solberg.

Okay, eh.. My ship is loaded with insects.

My ship is loaded with ice.

My ship is loaded with-

What the fuck?
What was that?

Shit. Fuck.

Did you see it?
-No.

So weird.
-Really strange.

It's..

Hello?

Hi!
-The fuck?

Elias!
-Jonas!

What's up?
-You came!

Of course I came!

How did you find it?
-Embedded GPS in my brain.

No, I asked a guy
at the parking space up there.

Hello.
-Hello.

Hello.
-Hi.

So this is where you guys hang?
-Really cool.

Good atmosphere at least.

It'll be a party.

Where should I sleep?

In the bedroom with Isak.

I'll sleep with the gay guy?
-Why is everyone calling me gay?

You are gay.

He's joking. Have a little humor.

What? He asked if he
could come. What should I have said?

That was really awesome.
-Yeah, it works now.

Do you need help?

You set the table?
Yes.

Hm, looks good. Can I taste it?

Good.

We're gonna have a smoke.

Smoke?

Yeah, a smoke.
-You don't even smoke.

Come on, it's a party.

Yeah, it's a party.

You really don't need help?
-No.

Food's ready!

Jonas!

Seriously?

Not funny.
-It's a little funny.

You're able to
help yourself, aren't you?

Why are you so pissed all the time?

I'm pissed because
you're behaving like a complete jerk.

Jerk? What did I do?

Say what I did!

You invited loads of people
to a cabin trip that was just supposed to be us.

Two guys?
-Yes.

You change personalities
once Elias is around.

And you're texting with Ingrid behind my back,
when you know how much of a bitch she is to me!

Ingrid? I'm not going behind your
back talking to Ingrid!

What did she say I did?
-You think I don't know you text her?

I texted with her about French.
-About French?

During fall break?
-We have homework for after the break.

Yeah okay, if it's about French,
I can read the messages.

Why would you read my messages?
-You can read my messages!

I don't need to read your messages.
-Why?

You have to read my messages
so we can trust each other? -Yeah.

That's ridiculous!
-Jonas!

This is ridiculous!

What the fuck? Why do
you think that I talk to Ingrid?

It's true, right?
-Yeah, about school!

Can I see your messages?
-I already told you it's ridiculous!

Why don't you trust me?

Did you hear they started their bus already?
-No?

One month into high
school and they started their bus already.

Ingrid‚Ä¶
I miss you.

You look like a slut.

Maybe I can get a friend?

You invited loads of people on a cabin trip
that was supposed to be just us! -Two guys?!

I can see your messages then.
-I already told you, this is ridiculous!

Why don't you trust me?

I'll call you later, okay?

Yeah.

Eva...

I'm sorry.

If I knew how important this cabin
trip was for you, I wouldn't have invited the guys.

I didn't know it wasn't
that important to you.

It was important to me!

But‚Ä¶

It's also important to
me to spend time with my friends.

It used to be
important to you, too.

It's important to me.
But not as important as your friends.

I told you that
you could bring friends!

Can't you just-
-Get some friends?

That's not what I meant.

But it's what you're thinking.

I don't know
what the right answer is.

Just be completely honest.

Completely honest?

Eva, you are the coolest girl I know.

You're pretty, sweet, smart, and funny.

But‚Ä¶

I don't know what the problem is.

You have to find new friends!

Get yourself new friends!

Anyone who gets to
be your friend is really lucky.

You don't know what to say?
-I nailed it.

You nailed it.

Congratulations on having me as a friend!

Hey girl! What's up?

Hi, is what I meant. Wanted to write Hi, but then
I pressed the send button and so it was just H. Haha.

Hello.

How are you doing?

I'll sit here.

Hi.

Or.. H?

H-H.

Should we have done homework during the fall break?
-Yes!

Fuck!

Eva?

What does the main
character of this story do?

She feels alone.

Noora, I don't want you to respond for Eva.

She hadn't found her homework yet.

I was just helping.

You asked it the wrong way.

The right way would be:

What are the main
characters of the story like?

You're right. I'm sorry!

I lived in Madrid.
Okay, okay.

That's why I don't have friends.
In Oslo.

What's your excuse?

Strong body odor.

Culturally.

Hi!

Thanks for last time.
-Hi!

I can't remember if I greeted
you properly. I was a little out of it.

Vilde.
-Eva.

It was so nice of
you to help me!

No, no. It was nothing!

We were wondering
if you already had a Russ bus.

Eh, no.

That's perfect! We just rented a
completely new bus. We really want you to join.

I haven't really started
thinking about Russ time.

It's really important to think about it
if you want to be on a bus.

I don't know what it's like in Trondheim,
but here in Oslo you have to start planning really early.

Otherwise you end up on a
bad bus, or you become a g√•-russ.
(= graduate not participating in bus activities)

Being a Russ is not just about Russ time,
it's also about being social and about unity.

Yes, think of it a like a sect.
Once you're in, you can't get out.

It ends in a collective suicide in Tryvann,
on the night of the 17th of May in 2018.

She's just joking.

Do you perhaps want to join
our bus meeting Friday after school?

Yeah, yeah ok.
-Yeah?

That's so cool! If you
have friends, just take them with you!

We'll see each other then.

What the fuck was that?

What is it?

She was sucking on that spoon
and looking him straight in the eyes.

Who is she?

H. As in, "Have you got a drug problem?"

Or H as in, "Have you got any plans for Friday?"

Hi!

Vilde, this is Noora.

Hi.

Have you talked to Chris?
-No.

We can't have the bus meeting
at hers, her mom is having a wine reception.

And we can't have it
at mine because it'll be stressful for me.

So I was wondering
if we can do it at yours?

Mine?

Eh, yes! But how
many will come?

Do you want to join?

What?
-Bus meeting.

Bus meeting‚Ä¶ what?

We'll create the world's coolest
Russ bus. You want to join?

No.

Then we're with three‚Ä¶

Hi guys. Meet Sana.
She'll join the bus meeting.

Where do you know each other from?

We met at a Ramadan
programme in the mosque.

She's joking. We have German together.

But you want to join our bus meeting?

Yes.

Is that okay, then?

What's the problem?

No, eh‚Ä¶

Since you're Muslim, isn't it true that
Muslims aren't allowed to be a Russ?

No, it's punished by stoning.

When is it?
-Tomorrow. Who's hosting?

Me.

I'll put your address in the GPS.

Auf Wiedersehen!

It means "see you later".

She can't be on our bus.
-Why not?

We'll give her a chance.
She was really cool.

We?

You're not even on our bus.

If she's joining, so am I.

Awesome!

We have a really big advantage over the other
bus groups. I already bought a lot of toilet paper.

Vilde managed to buy toilet paper
for 40.000 Kroner with a credit card from another bus.

Anyway, we're left with
a profit of 60.000 Kroner.

According to the budget, we'll
need 50.000 next to the toilet paper sales.

So I'll need an individual plan from
all of you on how you'll earn that money.

Is there something?

We're wasting time on
toilet paper. It's not enough.

It's important that we have

Listen, we're losers at school. If we don't
want to end up in a loser car, we need a strategy.

We aren't the losers of the school.
-Wasn't it you who was thrown out of another bus?

Not really thrown out.

Yes you were.

Listen, Vilde. It'll be hard if you
deny everything. Acknowledge that we're losers.

Do you think so yourself?

Hello?! I'm a Muslim girl in a faithless country.
I'm the biggest loser of them all.

You talk really maturely.
-Thanks.

But what do you want us to do?

First, we need to get more girls.
Cool girls.

How do we do that?

Ask them?
-Wrong.

We ask nothing.
The cool girls ask us.

But first, we need something we don't have.

A four-letter word.

"Spenn."
-Cred.

Spenn has five letters, Chris.

Do we know any '97 guys?

Okay..

Then we need to find out who from the '97 people have
the best bus, get ourselves invited to parties and to those busses.

Any idea how we'll do that?

You guys have to hook up with them.

Are you serious?

"You guys"?
-I'm not hooking up!

Okay, so we'll hook up.
What will you contribute?

Are you kidding me? I'm rescuing you here with
a strategic plan and you're wondering what I'll contribute?

Does anyone have a boyfriend?

I do.

How old is he?

He's from '99.

Dump him.

You're not serious?

She's the prettiest here.
It's wasted if she has a boyfriend.

Honestly. This is really stupid.

What is?

You can't ask us to use our
sexuality in exchange for credibility.

You're crazy.
-No, I'm honest.

Norwegian girls exchange sex for money,
popularity, and acknowledgement every day.

We might disagree on values. But this
isn't news to you! It's your culture.

It is crazy. So try to change it
instead of criticising it.

But it's a little much to
ask Eva to break up with her boyfriend.

It was a suggestion. She can think
for herself. She's not a child.

I think it went well.

Hello.

He's on a bus with William.
-Who's William?

He's the most handsome and coolest
guy in all of third year.

Invite me to have
dinner with your mom.

Friday.
-Yeah... Friday.

Guess who's invited
to the Penetrator party on Friday?

Are you for real, Eva?!

William asked me if I wanted to
go outside with him. I think we'll hook up.

Hi! Is Jonas home?
-Yeah, he's in the living room.

Hello.
-Hi.

What are you guys playing?
-FIFA.

What's up?

What?

Where's your Russ crew today?

Don't you have a shitload to do?

It's only two years and seven
months until Russ time. You better start working.

I know. I'm really jealous of you guys, who
spend their time on more constructive things...

Like playing videogames all day long.

What are you mad about now?

I'm not mad. I'm just
kidding. Have a little humor.

I have to talk to you.

Drama!

What's wrong?

What's wrong with you?
-There's nothing wrong with me.

Okay...

So why haven't
you replied to my messages?

I was busy.

So you're not mad I forgot our thing yesterday?
-No, no.

I don't care.

You don't care?

Don't stress about it.

Okay, good.
-Good.

Fine.

Yeah, so I'll go.
-You're welcome to stay.

No, I have a lot of stuff to do.

Yeah, I'll call you.

He claims he's not pissed, but I think
there's something when he doesn't want to talk about it.

But isn't he just pissed because he thought
that you didn't want him to meet your mom?

He thinks you're embarrassed of him.

You think so?

Just let him meet
your mom. What's the problem?

Chris has to tell Sana
that she can't be on our bus any longer.

Why?

Hello?! She nearly ruined our
entire social status, and I had to fix it.

I had to explain to the Penetrator
guys that we don't usually create a lot of drama.

It's really important what they think of us.

But maybe it wasn't Sana's fault?
-Have you met Sana? She's incredibly rude.

Sara and Ingrid aren't
the nicest people in the world.

I know Sara and Ingrid really well
and they're not girls who start drama.

Really...

William...

What's up with you two?
-I think we'll sleep together.

Okay?

Don't you think you should
get to know him a little better first?

Why? He's totally perfect.

I want my first time to be with the most handsome,
coolest '97 guy rather than someone basic.

You'll remember your first time for the rest of your life.
-His first time?

I've also heard that
William is really, really good in bed.

And that usually you don't get
an orgasm the first time. But with William, you do.

I've heard about
five girls who got an orgasm.

Okay...

Hello?! I'm doing this for you guys too!
This will guarantee we'll get to party on their bus.

Vilde?!

There's something I was wondering.

Can I borrow the pill from you guys?
You can't borrow the pill.

Not one pill. I thought for
a week or something. You have it?

I don't have it.

Me neither.

Don't you sleep with your boyfriend?

I have a NuvaRing. And you
don't want to borrow that one.

Where did you get it?

The doctor.

So much stress. Can't
you order it online or something?

I don't know.
-Just go to the school doctor.

Can you come with me?
-Why?

Because it's really weird to go there alone.
-It's so much less weird with us...

Of course we can come, Vilde.

William!

Hey, are you awake?
-Yeah, I can't sleep.

What are you doing?
-It's just boring work.

No wonder your grades
are going down if you don't sleep at night.

I definitely won't sleep
if we're going to talk about grades.

How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
-Why are you asking and interrogating like that?

It was just a normal question.

Yeah. Yeah, they're doing well.

I have a boyfriend.

Oh?

Hm-hm.

Who is it?

Who?
-Hm-hm.

I thought you could meet him.

Yes!

Before you leave again?
-Hm-hm.

Maybe we can invite
him over for dinner?

Yes.

When are you leaving again?
-Saturday morning.

Maybe Friday night?

So nice.

Hi.

Have you become friends again, or?

This is Noora. I've told you about Noora.

Noora.
-Hello. Jonas.

We have an appointment at the school doctor.
-Yeah, what about Vilde?

Vilde will meet us there.

What's going on at the doctor?

We're helping a friend get laid.

Okay... Good luck with that.
-Thanks!

You guys are so slow!

Sorry!
-But, are you doing anything on Friday?

What is she doing here?

How did you know we were here?

Eva's boyfriend told me.

Did you tell your boyfriend?!
-I have the best news in the world!

Sana sold all the toilet paper!
-Vilde Lien?

I'm serious!
-How did she manage that?

I don't know! She said you
just had to send your account number and address.

Are you kidding?
-No!

Can she please join our bus?
-It's not something illegal?

No, no! She's Muslim.

No, but as a Muslim you go to hell if you do
something illegal. She doesn't really want to go to hell.

Welcome!

Everyone.

What can I help you with?
-She's gonna sleep with a guy.

You're so lucky!

For the first time.

That's not just anything.

What do you mean?

My cousin bled so
much that she got anemia.

That's bullshit.
-No, bleeding can happen during your first intercourse.

Large bleedings should be taken
seriously because they can in fact kill you.

She just got a little weak.
-Then she was lucky.

I had a patient once who bled so extremely
that we feared she would pass out.

Because she had sex for the first time?

No, she cut herself. She bled so much
that we had to give her a blood transfusion.

But she just wants to have the pill.

Yes. When will the intercourse take place?

On Friday.
-On Friday?!

That's when William's available.
I thought that we could drink in Eva's basement.

We should drink? You're the
one who will be having sex with him.

I can't drink by myself.
You have to support me.

Why do you have to drink at all?

It can't be at my place.
Mom's home and Jonas is coming.

Please-
-Have you seen one like this before?

Do any of you perhaps want
to see how to put on a condom?

It's difficult to open.

It tends to be...

There we go.

Be honest, how painful is it?

I don't remember anything from my first time.

Just drink, you won't feel anything.

Do you want to be
so drunk that you don't remember anything?

Were you drunk your first time?
-No.

Pinch my arm.
How much does it hurt?

Seriously?
-It doesn't resemble pinching.

Just relax,
so it doesn't hurt.

What do you know?
You haven't even had sex.

Okay, seriously.
William has to call soon.

What did he write last?

Pick you up around 7.
We'll find something.

Can't you just call him?

I can't seem too desperate for his dick.

But what if he doesn't send a message?

Then I would be a little bit relieved.
-Vilde, you don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.

I want to! But I just don't want it to hurt.

No, but that's why
you have to relax.

What turns you on about him?

Turns me on?

What gets you horny?
-Horny...

Nothing makes me horny.
-You're never horny?

Are you?
-Yes!

Why don't you have sex then?

I know what can make you horny.

I won't be
involved in lesbian stuff.

Vilde, it's not lesbian stuff.
Just lie on your back and close your eyes.

Imagine you and William
standing in the bedroom. Are you imagining it?

Yes.
-What's happening?

What's happening?
-Yeah, describe it.

We're standing in the bedroom.

I'm wearing a white dress.
-Yeah, good. Continue.

Okay!

The dress is almost similar to
a Stella McCartney dress with lace at the bottom.

But it doesn't have lace at the bottom.

I have my hair down.
No! I'm wearing it up.

But my up-do is loose
so my hair falls down some.

I'm wearing light pink lipstick.

Not the lightest from Mac,
but the one that's kind of medium.

This actually works!

Seriously?

I think so!

You get horny when
talking about clothes and make-up?

Yes!

People get horny from different things.

I was watching a documentary
about the countryside and got horny from donkeys.

Eva?

I'm coming!

Okay, you guys have to leave now.

We can't go.
He hasn't sent a message yet.

Go to your house, then.
-I can't go home, I've been drinking.

Can't we just
sit here? We can be quiet.

Eva?

Yeah, I'm coming!

Okay, okay!
But you have to be really quiet.

Leave through the window, okay?

Hi!
Hi. Shouldn't your boyfriend be coming now?

Eh, yes! But he sent
a message that he's a bit delayed.

Okay.

Where the hell are you?

Do you need help?
Where the hell are you?

Do you need help?

No, it's going well.

What was that?

I forgot to turn off a movie.
I'll fix it.

What are you doing here?

Is Vilde here?
-No! Eh, yes. But you can't be here.

Hi! Nice to meet you.
-Hi. William.

No, no, no. This isn't
my boyfiriend. This is Vilde's boyfriend.

Oh, really?
Who's Vilde?

A friend. William thought Vilde
was here, but she isn't. So he's leaving now.

Chris, Noora, Vilde!
What are you doing here?

Remember when I borrowed your jacket?

Well we thought we'd bring it.

But you weren't in your basement, so we
left it in a bag outside... your window.

Yeah, thanks.
But now you surely have to go again.

Yeah, yeah. We have so
many jackets to deliver. So we'll just...

See you!
Come.

Bye!

What's going on here, Eva?

Nothing's going on.
-Were those girls drunk?

No.

Where are you?
-I can't come anymore.

Why not?

Because I forgot I said I'd help my mom with something.
-Can't you help her later?

No it's really important.
I have to do it now.

Who was that?
-That was my sister.

Jonas!
-I'm sorry, but I have to go now.

He's the most handsome and
coolest guy in all of third year.

I think we're going to sleep together.

I like it.
I think it's a little hot.

You! Don't be a dick tease.

Ingrid...
I miss you.

You look like a slut.

I'm not going behind
your back and talking to Ingrid.

Where are you?
-I can't come.

Who was that?

Jonas!

Sorry, I have to go.

Hello.

Hi.

Sad?

No!

I bought coffee for you!

Thanks.

What should we talk about?

Nothing. It's just nice to have coffee.

What did you do on the weekend?

Eh... Nothing.

What did you do on Friday?

Mom had her birthday.

So you were just home?

Yeah!

Did something happen on Friday?

No, I was just wondering what you did.

I think that maybe
Jonas was with Ingrid.

Do you know anything about it?

No.

Why do you think so?

I talked on the phone with
him and heard her voice in the background.

Did you ask him?

Yeah, but he said it was his sister.

Maybe it was.

I know Ingrid's voice.
We've been best friends for four years.

Say that to him.

I did, but he got really mad
and said that I didn't trust him.

Eva, why are you with him?

What do you mean?

Jonas is my bro, but why
are you with someone you don't trust?

So do you think I should trust him?

Or you could go for option three.

You could ask Ingrid.

I'll soon see William again.

I think we have something going on,
but the age difference is quite big.

There could really be something between us.

He said he thinks I'm really special.
And I'm ready for it.

Did I tell you I had an orgasm?

Smile.

How was that?

Smile yourself.
How was that?

Smile yourself.

It was a bit like
a sneeze. Just down there.
Smile yourself.

It was a bit like
a sneeze. Just down there.

Like a sneeze?

Hm-hm.

I am smiling.

I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

You're angry.
I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

Yeah, why is that?

Because he was really big.

You can't go around telling
people about his dick.

Why not?

You're asking why you
can't tell people about his most vulnerable body part?

Firstly, that body part wasn't that vulnerable.

And secondly, he'll surely talk
about my body to his friends.

Girls should also
be able to do that.

I support equality and feminism.

But Vilde, firstly, size doesn't
have anything to do with orgasms.

And secondly, just because guys
are fools, doesn't mean we have to be fools as well.

It doesn't have anything
to do with equality at all.

Whatever...

But it was good, then?
That's the most important part.

It was really good.

But, there's just one thing.

There's no one who tells you
it practically runs out again.

You didn't use a condom?

No, he said he tends not to use one.
-Vilde!

What the fuck is that?

Where are those from?
-Sana knows someone.

It's to fetch the toilet paper.

But I need payment first.
-That's not how it works.

He receives payment from his people,
and then you can pay your people.

But I don't have "people".

Do you think MasterCard operates without people?

Hello.

Hi!
-Hello.

Are you guys coming
to the Halloween party on Friday?

Yeah, maybe.
-We're coming!

Good. We'll talk.

Bye!

You smell like smoke.

What's up, Eva?

This doesn't bother me...

I think there's something
between you and Ingrid.

Really?

You still think so?

I know I heard her voice on the phone!

For the last time, that was my sister
talking in the background!

Why would she be talking in the background?
-Because she thought it was my mom!

Wasn't your mom at home?

Jonas!

You said you would help
your mom with something at home.

But your mom wasn't even home?
-No, she came home later. That's why I called.

Why are you lying to me?
-I'm not lying!

This is not working.

It isn't working?

What do you mean by that?

Do you want a break or something?

That's what you want.
-No, that's not what I want!

Stop being so
insecure all the time.

What's up with you? Why aren't you
listening to me? I want to talk to you.

Can't you get to
the point? Just admit it!

I got a glass of water and...
He's a guy who only looks-

How's it going with
the alcohol for the party?

I sent William a message if he
could get it for us. -Can he?

He hasn't replied yet. He's extremely busy.
He's in the third year, and he's the bus boss.

He has so much to think about.
We haven't talked properly since last time.

But we do keep in
contact via. Snapchat.

You know what I did yesterday?

No?

I sent William a topless picture.

What did you do?

They're just boobs.
William likes confident girls.

What did he reply?
-He didn't reply directly, but he took a screenshot.

Now listen, Einstein.

William is not interested.

How do you know?
-He didn't even reply to a topless picture.

In "The Game" it says that boys
don't reply to make girls more interested.

If I were you, I would put down "The Game"
and start reading "He's Just Not That Into You".

Why are you always so mean?

Hello?!

We are her friends. If we don't
tell her the truth, who will?

She's sending topless pictures
to a guy who is lying to sleep with her.

That's mean!
-You don't know if he's lying!

He doesn't really seem
like the most trustworthy guy.

I mean that you can't just
claim people are lying without having proof.

Sometimes you have to trust people.

Everyone knows that guys lie.

And how do you know that?
-Their stories are inconsistent.

They get mad when you ask.
Afterwards, they get a bad conscience..

.. and they start drowning you in compliments.

Believe me, just wait and see.

William will break her heart.

You know you're the coolest, best, hottest,
funniest, prettiest girl in the whole world? I love you.

Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me.

Last Friday?

Yeah! Yeah, I was with Jonas.

He didn't tell you?

Oops.

Fuck you!

No, fuck you Eva. Fuck you!

I talked to Ingrid and she told me EVERYTHING!

You're sitting here?

I'm sitting here.

Someone's obviously trying to reach you.
-Yeah.

Who is Jonas?

My boyfriend.

Or, eh...

You don't know if he's your boyfriend, or?

He is my boyfriend, it's just that...

We're having a fight.

Hey, you...

Fuck him.

If he makes such a
nice girl cry, fuck him.

This can't happen.

There you are.

What are you guys doing?

Eva's fighting with her boyfriend.
Have you met Eva?

Eva, this is Iben.
My girlfriend.

You shouldn't be talking to me.
Iben's really good with boyfriend trouble.

She's fighting with her boyfriend.
-Ah, poor you.

I'll give you two some time.

I'm fine, really.
You don't need to-

Believe me, I know what it's like.

You're a first year. When people try to figure
out who they are, and they change a lot.

People might not be
the way you thought they were.

The same goes for boyfriends.
When I was in the first year my boyfriend was an asshole.

He cheated five
times without me knowing about it.

It gets better when you get older.

It's going really well between me
and Christoffer, because third year guys are more mature.

We can talk about everything,
and I trust him 110%.

You'll get a more mature
relationship, if you know what I mean.

Are you also in the third year?

No, second. But a lot happens
from your first to your second year.

Don't take relationships so seriously.

Think of it as something temporary.
Don't let him stand in your way.

It's Halloween! There's a really cool
party here. And you're sitting here like a sad ballerina.

Don't you agree?

Come on, let's go.
Let's have an awesome time.

Thanks, you're really kind...

But I don't feel too good,
so I think I might go home.

Are you sure?

Really sure?

It'll get better.

Black Swan?

I can't handle us breaking up.

The thing is that
Ingrid's brother is a dealer.

Dealer of what?
-Greens.

Have you started smoking marijuana?

Huh?

Why?

You're reacting as if it was heroin.

Marijuana is a drug.

So you think it's equally as dangerous as heroin?
-Yes!

I was at Ingrid's brother's place to buy stuff.

Ingrid showed up. But she lives there,
so I couldn't say anything to you.

Why didn't you say anything to me?
-Seriously? Did you see your reaction just now?

Anyway, my point is that
there's nothing between me and Ingrid.

And there never
will be anything, either.

It was really dumb of me to lie.

The fact that you believe there was...

That really hurt me.

Because I trust you 100%.

You have to start trusting me.

I would never do
anything that could destroy us.

Because it's us.

Right?

Don't cry.

Did something happen on Friday?

I think Jonas was with Ingrid.

Why are you lying to me?
-I'm not lying!

Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me!

Last Friday? Yeah.
Yeah I was with Jonas.

Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

I'll meet William again soon.
There really can be something between us.

Ingrid's brother is a dealer.

I trust you 100%.

First there's Ring Lord
instead of Lord of the Rings.

Then we have The Lion King.
Taking Lion literally, you can have sex in the woods.

I won't!

Or instead of the Hunger Games,
we'll say the Thirst Games.

The Thirst Games!

Because we drink. And we
don't drink Pepsi Max, if you know what I mean.

No? It's about
Smirnoff Light here.

Did you know Diet Coke won in
the Pepsi Max versus Diet Coke test?

So Pepsi Max really
isn't that great. It isn't!

No!

What are you doing on your plate, Vilde?

I'm just sorting my salad.

I don't think you have to sort it anymore.

When should we talk
about what happened at the Halloween party?

That William and Sara hooked up.
-Who are they?

Were you upset?

No, dear god. It was a hook up party. It was completely
normal to hook up at the party. Everyone hooked up with each other.

Penetrator Henrik hooked up with Frida from 1STE.

Borkis hooked up with Elise from 1STB.

Chris hooked up with someone.
And then there's William and Sara.

Chris, who did you hook up with?
No, not this Chris. Penetrator Chris.

Who did he hook up with?

I don't know. I just
heard he hooked up with someone.

Hello.
-Hi.

What are you doing today?
-Thought I'd go skate.

Can I come? And watch?

Yeah... When did you get into that?

I feel like being with you.

But I have to go now.
We'll talk later.

Love you!
-Yeah, you too.

Question.

Is Isak available?

Yeah. Why?

I felt there was some
electric chemistry going on here.

Some really hot vibes between us.

Seriously.

I see it's going
better with you and Jonas.

Yes.

You don't want to say why?

No, we just talked some stuff out.

I fucked up badly.
-What?

What did you do?

Isak.

If I tell you this, you have
to promise not to say anything to Jonas.

Okay, I promise.

Seriously.

Otherwise you could
ruin our relationship.

I'm not gonna tell anyone, okay?
You can trust me.

What did you do?

You know how I thought
there was something between Ingrid and Jonas?

Hm-hm.

So I asked Ingrid if they
had been together.

And they had been.

Seriously?

But there was a reason for it. It was...

But Ingrid didn't tell me that.

So I was really pissed. And sad.

I hooked up with Chris.

You hooked up with Chris?!

The girl who keeps eye fucking me?

No, no!

Chris from the third year. Christoffer.

So you hooked up with a third year?

Fuck! It's really-

It was just hooking up, right?
Nothing more happened?

No, no.

It would been worse
if it wasn't just hooking up.

If it had meant something to you.
But you were just angry.

Yeah...

It feels shitty not
to tell Jonas.

Honestly, Eva...

If I had a girl who had hooked up
with someone else, I wouldn't want to know.

Things like that fuck up a relationship.
You don't have to tell him if it meant nothing.

And it seems like you're more in love with
him now than you were before, right? Maybe it was a good thing?

It was just a little hook up, right?

It'll be okay, but make sure no one knows.
That it won't come from someone else.

Especially from Chris, right?

It'll be okay.

Thanks.

For what?

You know.

Vilde!

Hi!

I have to ask you something.

Yesterday you said Chris
hooked up with someone at the Halloween party.

What do you know about it?

I just heard he
hooked up with someone.

Okay... Who said that?

Or was it Robin who hooked up with someone?
-Robin?

Now that I think about
it, it was Robin. Chris has a girlfriend.

Yeah, okay.

Do you like him?

Huh? No, no!

Think of how perfect it would be if I'm
together with William, and you're with Chris.

Vilde, seriously?!

It was just a suggestion...

You can't walk around in that
sweater thinking you'll be together with William.

Come here.

You see that girl over there?

She has slept with William.

See her over there?

She has also slept with William.
There comes another one.

There, and up there.

You can't know that all those girls slept
with William! There's a lot of guys on their bus.

Vilde, it's marked on the sweater.

The one you've slept
with is marked in red.

You're walking around like some
living trophy now. You have to forget William!

Give him back the sweater,
and take back your integrity!

He's the loser, not you.

You need to know that if a guy doesn't like you
it's not you there's something wrong with. It's him.

But how do you think like that?

I keep thinking it's
me there's something wrong with.

Hi.
Hello.

What are you doing here?

What do you mean by that?

Hi.

Hello.
-Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. What about you?
-Good. I was reading.

Yeah, what?

Elle.

Are you gonna get that, or?

Yeah!

Hallo?

You're such a stalker!

Hi, mom! I can't talk
right now. Someone's visiting.

Mom?! What kind of
sick game are you playing?

I'll call you afterwards, okay?

Okay, my girl! We'll call afterwards.

Okay, bye!
-Wait, one more thing.

Have you done your homework?
-Bye!

Was that your mom?
-Yeah!

"Someone's visiting"?!

It's REALLY important that you shut up
about what happened on Halloween, okay?

Have you still not told her we're together?

You know what? You had the chance to meet my
mom but you chose to smoke marijuana with Ingrid's brother.

What?

It's sweet that you call it marijuana.

I'll keep my mouth shut. No worries.

What's sweet about it? That's what it's called.

Yeah.

But..
-But?

Only old people say it.

Old people?! I'm a little
older than you. Little smarter.

What do you call drugs?

Drugs...

I don't know. We just
call it greens or something.

But it's the same.
And it's not good for you.

You're really far away now. Do you see me?

I'm perfectly fine.

Then you're an alcoholic.
You've tried drinking alcohol.

You can't compare those!
-That's what you're saying!

Okay, great. So I'm a junkie
for trying it sometimes. -Sometimes?!

How many times?
-I don't know.

Are you awake all night?
-No.

Can't you stop for my sake?

I can do everything for your sake.

Yeah?
-Yeah.

You can't buy pink uggs!
-Uggs in general.

Why not?
-They're super comfortable, though.

They look insanely ugly.

I've decided on what
I'm going to say to William.

Say?

What are you talking about?
-My integrity.

You don't have any. Next subject.

What are you gonna say?

I will say that I will not be
treated like this.

Huh?

And then, I'll return the sweater.

You can't do that.
-Why not?

We're finally in with the Penetrator guys,
and now you're going to fuck everything up?

Says you, who ruined things for
all first years the first time we were invited to a party.

Sana, it's good that Vilde will explain
to William that she will not be treated like crap.

She can't tell him! It won't work.
It's better to be completely cool.

It's possible to be cool and speak up.

There he is.

You're going to say it now?!

Yes.

He's with his friends.
-I don't give a shit who he's with!

Hi.
-Hi?

If you thought I would walk around like
some living trophy, you're terribly wrong.

Don't play dumb!
You know what I mean.

What's your name again?

Vilde.

Okay, Vilde. Take a deep breath.

I think there's a
small miscommunication here.

I'm sure it's my fault.

If you think I look
at you like some trophy, you're wrong.

Because you're not good enough.

What an awesome guy you are!

Who are you?

What happened that made
you have such an inferiority complex...

... that you have to piss on the feelings of
a first year girl to feel cool?

Were you never validated as a child, or?

Did mommy never compliment your drawings?

Or did daddy never come to
any of your graduations?

You didn't have hair on your
dick in 7th grade and you were bullied for it?

Anyway, you have to seriously
get over it and start behaving like a human.

Stop walking around like a fucking cliche.

I have to go to Norwegian.

No...
-I have to!

But seriously, I really have to go.
I've been late way too many times.

We'll talk!

Fucking hell, you
were so awesome yesterday.

Yeah, you were legendary.

Are you doing okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Completely over William.

Good.

Anyway, nobody cares about what happened. Everyone's
talking about that rumor that's going around about Chris.

What rumor about Chris?

Chris hooked up with someone at the Halloween party,
and his girl found out. She went psycho!

But you said it wasn't Chris!

Chris hooked up with
someone at the party. I saw it.

You saw it?

On the staircase.
-Staircase?!

You fucking whore!

Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

It was just a hook up.

You just follow what
everyone else thinks is exciting.

Chris hooked up with
someone at the party. I saw it.

You saw it?
-On the staircase.

Staircase?!

I got an unpleasant phone call from the Rad girls
saying that as long as Eva is on our bus, we're all blacklisted.

I don't understand why you're
attacking Eva, when they're the enemy.

Jonas and Ingrid were a couple. So Eva only has
herself to blame for the situation she is in now.

PS: On the back there's
a greeting in period blood.

Hi.

Hi.

You were right.

The Rad girls are after the entire bus.

Whatever. I'm not on the bus anymore.

Why not?

Why bother being on a
blacklisted bus where everyone hates me?

There is no one who hates you, Vilde.
-Sana made it pretty clear.

Anyway, I'm back with Pepsi Max.

Vilde!

I just want you to know I'm not
the type of person who steals other people's boyfriends.

What kind of person are you then?

When I think of Foss, I see
a dude jamming on his guitar.

When I think of the entrance,
I see those majestic stairs.

I strongly recommend this school.

Hi! I would like to change high school in the middle
of the school year.

Immediately. From Nissen to some place else.
Preferably Foss. Or Elvebakken.

Hi.
-Hi.

You weren't at school today.

No.

It's really unfair
that you get this much hate.

I have decided to change schools.

Why?

Because everything is fucked at Nissen.

And that's why you're changing schools?

Yes.

Okay...

Okay what?

It's just not typical of you.

What is that supposed to mean?
-I didn't know you were someone who would just give up.

What is this bullshit about what kind of person
I am? Maybe I am someone who gives up!

I don't know! Why would
you know what kind of person I am?

Everyone is like: "What kind of person are you?
You have to know who you are!" What a fucking cliche.

Yeah, ok.

Just chill.

I didn't mean it like that.

Sorry.

No...

It's actually not that complicated, Eva.

It's just what people do.

If you want to change schools because
things are a little fucked up, you are someone who gives up easily.

I'm not five years old. You thought
reverse psychology would work on me?

I don't know. Does it?

You've got to fight back girl

Yes?

Are you Maria?
Bus boss from Rad?

Yes.

I am Eva.

Okay.

I am that Eva.

Okay.

I just want to say that I got your letter.

I know I fucked up, but I think it's unfair
to blacklist the entire bus. My friends didn't do anything.

It was me. Take me, not them.

Okay, Eva...

You can say hi to your friends
and tell them we won't "take" them.

We have more important stuff
to do than blacklisting first years.

So, what's up with the letter then?

We haven't given you a letter.
Someone's fucking with you.

So you guys aren't mad
that I hooked up with Chris?

Eva, we don't give
a shit who you've hooked up with.

Even Iben's boyfriend?

Even Iben's boyfriend. Eva, listen.

I'm sure that in your head, this hook up is the
most important and dramatic thing you've done in your life

But for us who have been here
for a while, it's only a little comma.

So I suggest you accept that, okay?

Okay.

And relax.

You shouldn't care. Youre in
the first year. You'll hook up a lot.

But don't sleep around. There's a difference.

When we were in our first year,
we had a chlamydia epidemic.

Did you find out who started it?
-It was William.

It wasn't William.

Chris had it too, right?

It was one of the guys for sure.

Inaudible.

I see what you did wrong.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

You did it completely wrong, Sana.
-The answer key is wrong.

The answer key isn't wrong, Sana.
-It is! Because it doesn't have the same as me.

Hi!

Hi.

I talked to the Rad girls.

They aren't after us.
-Now I can finally breathe again!

It's Vilde who cares about that stuff and
is peeing her pants about some blacklist.

She isn't on our bus anymore.

Huh?!

She said she didn't want to be
on a bus where everyone hates her.

Something's wrong.

At the bus meeting, she was mean.
And Vilde isn't a mean person.

What?

It seems like you just defended Vilde?

I'm just saying something's wrong.

We are her friends.

You guys should pay more attention to her.

Okay...

You guys...

I feel like I owe you an explanation.
About what Vilde said about me and Ingrid.

But I don't have one.

I know I should've done things differently.

Save that speech for Ingrid.
-Fuck Ingrid!

You don't owe her shit. She was sucking up
to Iben and hooked up with Chris herself.

I'm sure it was her
who sent the period letter.

What are you saying now?
-You don't think it was her? I think so.

Has Ingrid hooked up with Chris?

Yes, I saw it at the Halloween party.
I saw her and Chris making out on the stairs.

Are you kidding me?
-No, I saw it!

And you're telling me this now?!

What? I've told it before.

I thought I told it before.

We have to talk.

Unless you want me to tell
Iben that you hooked up with Chris.

I know you don't want
to listen to me, but you have to.

Whether you want to or not,
we'll be going to the same school for the next three years.

You can't keep trying to block me out,
throwing shit, or sending me threat letters.

Just hear me out, okay?

I moved here from Bergen in the 7th grade...

No one wanted to hang out with me
because I talk so weird.

You were the only
one who took care of me.

I remember how proud and lucky...

I couldn't believe the most popular girls
in our class wanted to be friends with me.

I always really looked up to you.

You're the best
friend I've ever had.

Just the thought of me destroying that...

... makes me feel sick.

More than sick.

It made me stop
liking myself as a person.

But I can't continue having
regrets for the rest of my life.

It wasn't going well between you and Jonas.
You talked about breaking up with him every day.

I know that's not an excuse, but...

I loved him.

I wish I could do it
all over again, completely different.

But I can't.

I'm just going to have
to accept it and move on.

I'm saying this for the last time.

Okay?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that I lied
and went behind your back.

I'm sorry that I ruined our friendship.

You didn't deserve it.

I'm not trying to say you should like me.

Or that we should be friends again.

I just...

I can't bear any more threat letters, okay?

Okay.

No more shit.

But I didn't send a threat letter.

And I barely knew Iben when I hooked
up with Chris at the Halloween party.

Fucking hell!

Seriously?

You have serious issues.

What's wrong with you?
You can't just jump on people. Pull yourself together.

You're with the school's largest douche. Your way
of coping with it is to jump people and send threat letters?

I have a better suggestion for you...

Break up with your fucking
boyfriend. He's a fucking asshole.

I didn't mean it like that.

Yeah, I'm fine.

I know it's true, so...

I just...

I think you deserve better.
Everyone deserves better than that.

I love him.

Maybe he'll change.

It was good that he told you.

What?

That he had cheated.

He didn't tell me

He didn't?
-No.

Some people told me that's
how you knew about it.

That your boyfriend told you.

My boyfriend?! It was
your boyfriend who tipped me off.

My boyfriend?

Yes.

But my boyfriend didn't even know.

He must've done.
It was him who sent the tip.

That's how I found out about it.

Huh?

The little blonde one. The one
you're always with. Isn't he your boyfriend?

Isak Yaki? Isak?
Isn't that what he's called?

Did Isak send the tip?

I thought you knew.

I'm just sorting my salad.

I'm not on the bus anymore.

Anyway, I'm back with Pepsi Max.

Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

It was just a hook up.

Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

It was your boyfriend who sent the tip.

My boyfriend didn't even know.
-The little blonde one. Isak?

Isn't that what he's called?

Hello! This is Isak.
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

But you can leave a
message after the beep.

Okay, just wait for the beep.

Isak. You better answer the
phone because I need to talk to you.

Hi.
-Hi.

Where's Isak?

Isak is a bit upset.

What happened?

His dad left,
and his mother completely collapsed.

Shit.

Yeah, it's shit.

But, is everything okay?

I don't really know.
His mother was already pretty crazy.

Yeah.

Do you want me to get someone or?

Eh, no. I just wanted to talk to
him about something.

He's not answering his phone.
-I think he turned it off.

How are you doing?

Good!

Or...

You know.

Yeah, I know.

Say hi to him.

Don't you want to come in?
I'm sure he wants to see you.

No, eh. I think...

He has you, so...

Yeah.

Bye.

Bye.

What's the symbol for porridge?

I'm really struggling here.

"In the barn sits Santa with his Christmas porridge."

What's this porridge?
Porridge is porridge.

Why did you choose this song?
-I thought it was simple.

You have to hand it in next class.
-I know. And I forgot.

Porridge is the symbol of...

Life?
-Life? Fits perfectly. Life.

Did you do it?

What did you use?
-"Deilig er jorden"

Isn't that a really bad song?

It has a beautiful message.

Fuck! Message! What's the
message in "P√• l√•ven sitter nissen"?

Vilde?

Hi!

Hi.

How's it going with you?
-Really good! With you guys?

Come sit with us.

I would really love to, but me,
Sara, Ingrid, and Pepsi Max are going to the coffee place.

So.. Maybe next time?

How's it going with your bus?

Good.

Did you find a sponsor yet?

Not yet.

It's just one thing. They'll come running soon.

Hi! Are you guys here?
Do you want to eat here?

I'll just go and get my
jacket, I'll be right back.

What happened just now?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out when you go up the stairs.
Me?! It's you who has to look out.

Okay...

How's it going with Isak?

Yeah, it's going better now.

But he's not at school.
No, he's chilling at home for a bit.

Call or text him. He would like that.

Yeah, I'll do that. I forgot.

What do you have now?
-French.

Awkward.

Jonas!

What are you doing?!

Jonas!

Fuck, you have to back me up!
-You hooked up with his girl. If I were him I would've killed you.

Hi!

Hi.

How's it going?

Fine. Or...

It's going great.

How's it going with you?

It's going well.

I dumped Chris.

Did you?
-Hm-hm.

That's good, Iben!
-Yeah.

Also, I'm having a girl power
Christmas party on Friday. You have to come.

Girl power Christmas party?
-Yeah, where no third year guys are invited.

Okay.

They have too much power
at this school. All the drama is because of them.

Us girls have to start sticking up for each other.

Agreed?
-Agreed.

So, an all girls party?

No, no. We need guys there.
So I thought we could invite first year guys.

They're the most undervalued
group at school.

But come on Friday! Bring your friends.

Yeah, cool!

If you know any delicious
first year guys, invite them.

Yeah, I'll try.
-Okay, good.

But, I was wondering...

Could you maybe ask Vilde if she can come?

Vilde?

Yeah, Vilde Lien.
She's a first year.

Of course. Just take her with you.

I think she'd be happy
if you could invite her.

Yeah, okay! I'll find her on Facebook.

Thanks.

I need water!

Have you heard from Vilde?

No.

Have you heard from Vilde?

Eh, no.

Iben, did you invite Vilde?

Yeah, she said she would come.

Check this on snapchat.

Even more first year guys!

Isak?

Hi! Eva!

How's it going with you?

It's going... better.

Good.

How's it going with your mom now?

Good... It's a lot of stress.

Her and dad will
surely find a solution.

Good.

So, it's going better with you now?

Now it's going better.

I have news for you.
-Yeah?

Me and Jonas are back together.

Seriously?

He hasn't said anything, but... great!

Yeah, I know.

He has forgiven you and everything?

Yes!

Great!

So I just want to say..
Thanks so much for being there for me.

I don't know what I would've done without you.

I don't have many people I can trust.

But you're one of them. So, thanks.

I'm just glad you guys worked it out.

Yeah. I'm happy you support us.

Team Jonas!

There's just one thing I'm wondering.

Hm?

Did you also support us when
you told everyone that me and Chris hooked up?

Because our relationship
went to hell after that!

My whole life went to hell after that!
So you have to tell me what you were thinking.

Because I think it's psycho.
Why did you do it?!

What were you thinking?

You really don't know why?

No, I really don't know why!

Think about it.

What? Do you have...

Do you have...

... feelings for me?

Like you didn't know?

No...

I didn't know.

So it's not that great for
me to have to listen to you...

... talk about Jonas,
and me having to be your advisor.

That's really not great for me.

Sitting there like an idiot.

And hoping that one day you'll know...

... that he's not good enough for you.

Isak, I didn't know.

Honestly, Eva. How did you not understand?

Anyway, it's not an excuse for what you did.

You outed me to the whole school!
-It was stupid. I fucked up.

I was drunk and...

I was also quite mad at you.

I thought you used me.

I didn't know Chris had a
psycho girlfriend who would create a bunch of drama.

Then I wouldn't have done it.

Eva, come.

Now!

Eva.

Don't...

You can't tell Jonas anything about this, okay?

Call an ambulance!

Vilde!

What happened?!

She came in, started staggering,
and then she tripped. She's not responding.

Is your mom home?
-No, no!

I think I killed William's baby tonight.

Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

Call me when you find out who you are.

It was just a hook up.

It was your boyfriend who sent the tip.
-Did Isak send the tip?

I think it's completely psycho.

Do you have feelings for me?

Like you didn't know.

Will you come home with me to do homework?
-No.

Let me know when you change your mind.

What are you doing on your plate?
-I'm just sorting my salad.

I'm not on the bus anymore.

She started staggering, and then
she tripped. She's not responding.

I think I killed William's baby tonight.

You kept pushing me out of bed.

You pulled away my covers.

Your mom is never at home?

She is, but she got a new job
at the Ministry of Environment so...

... ever since that she's been traveling a lot more.
She's home every other week.

You're alone a lot!
Isn't that cool?

You can do whatever you want.

Where's your dad?
-He lives in Bergen.

Chris! You get to clean it up.

Yeah, I'll clean it up.

Dad lives in Bergen.
Mom and dad are divorced.

I think we moved from Bergen when I was twelve?

Do you have contact with him?

No... Yeah, we have. But we kind
of lost contact when we moved.

My dad got remarried,
and his wife was a bit jealous.

Hi!
-Hi!

Hi.

We made breakfast.
-Yeah, Noora made pancakes.

Let's eat.

You can sit here.

Take some pancakes.

Just start! Sana?

Do you want juice, Vilde?

Here!

I just spilled a bit.

Do you want jam?

I don't remember anything from yesterday.

Nothing happened.
It was fine.

Blackouts are God's way
of telling you not to worry about anything, Vilde.

Nothing special happened.

You just passed out
when you came to Iben's party.

So we took you here.
You just slept.

Vilde..

Which girl with self-respect
hasn't blacked out at least once before?

Thank you.

I mean it.

You don't have to thank us. That's
why we're on a bus together. To help each other.

You still want me on your bus?
-What are you talking about? You're our bus boss!

You think any of us want
to do the financials and the budget?

But eh... I can be a
bit stressed as the bus boss.

If it interferes with other things.
That could easily happen.

Yeah, like what?

Well, like school and...

Things like fun stuff outside of school.

Or, eh...

A child.

Vilde, are you pregnant?

Are you sure?
-Yes.

How sure?

Yeah... yeah, yeah.

It'll probably be another
little trip to doctor Skrulle.

It's quite catchy.
-Who are you talking about?

Justin...

Your crush.

Eva, that's between us.
-Look, look!

Yeah, yeah.
I saw that.

Hi!

Hi.

The theater group invites you to the Christmas
tree lighting on Friday. Are you coming?

Maybe?

You have to.
The entire school will be there.

Okay, we're coming.
-Great!

Yeah, yeah. I've seen it.

Hi beautiful.

Willhelm! Wow.

You're not answering my messages?

No power.

For two weeks straight.

Should we skip the next class?

You have to give up now.
-Give up?

I won't give up.

You're wasting your time.

Listen, Noora Amalie S√¶tre.

You're a smart girl. You have
to understand that every time you reject me...

...I only want you more and more.

So if you really want to
get rid of me, just go on a date with me.

Stop playing hard to get.

Great logic.

Was that all, or?

No, one more thing.

Fucking hell, you're so beautiful.

Just tell me what I should do!

Hi...
-Hi.

Maybe we should talk.

Yes.

When can you talk?

I have lots to do this week.

But, Thursday maybe?

Thursday is fine.

What's up with him?

He's in love with me.
-You're kidding!

Hi there!

Oh, she's new. Salaam alaikum?

Vilde is pregnant!
-Ai, that went fast.

Vilde Lien, what should
I say? Congratulations?

She's not gonna keep the child!
-That's completely up to her.

She's 16! She's
still a child herself.

World's youngest mother
was 5 years old when she gave birth.

But she wasn't from Norway.
She was from some place in South America.

I want to say Chile.

Or was it Peru?

Yeah, hello?
-Hi. Yeah.

What should we do?

Yeah, what should we do?
I think the first thing we should do is a blood test.

I took a test.

When did you take the test?
-I took it on Friday.

On Friday? And have
you had sex since Friday?

No!
-Are you really sure?

There were a few hours
where it went a bit black..

Okay, girls. This here
is an ovulation test.

An ovulation test?

It will tell you the likelihood of you
getting pregnant after taking the test.

Seriously?

But there's more.
I feel sick in the morning.

I have a bloated stomach.
It's gotten a lot bigger.

I hasn't gotten that
much bigger. Can I take a look?

Does this hurt?

Yes.

How's your diet?
-Good.

What did you eat today?

It's still really early,
so a Cola Light and gum.

Yeah, got it.

Then I don't think there's a baby in your stomach.
There's probably air in your intestines.

That happens when you cram Cola Light and gum into your
stomach. It just produces more gas. Do you eat a lot?

No.
-No?

You should. You're pushing up too much air in your intestines.
Then you get a stomach ache. You have to fart it out.

In the worst case scenario we have to
give you a colostomy. It's like a poop bag on your stomach.

Are you serious?
-No, of course not.

But you can't live on Cola
and gum. That's the point I'm trying to make.

Yes! We will not be having a baby!

Vilde...

I see what you're doing.

And you have to stop.

You don't know what you're talking about.

Yes, I do know.

You stuff yourself with chocolate milk and
pancakes and you look like a super model.

What are you talking about?

You look like a super model.

Vilde, you're super pretty.

But not good enough.

Isak...

Be completely honest with me now.

Yes.

If I don't believe you, I'll ask
Jonas. Then I'll tell him why I'm asking.

I understand.

When we were at the cabin, and
I asked you if you knew if Jonas and Ingrid texted..

I knew he texted with
her because of her brother.

So it wasn't about French?

No. Well, maybe that too.

Jonas stressed like crazy about
bringing that shit on the cabin trip.

He couldn't reach her brother,
so instead he sent her a message.

You guys smoked at the cabin?

Yeah, that's why Elias came.
Jonas didn't get anything before we left.

I won't criticize you, but we were
pretty out of it. I'm surprised you didn't notice it.

Okay.

Anyway.

What about the other time?
When I thought I heard Ingrid's voice on the phone.

When I asked you,
did you know anything?

No.

I could've known it was
because of her brother.

But I promised Jonas I wouldn't
tell you anything about him smoking.

So I kept my promise.

But you advised me to ask Ingrid?

That was bad advice. Plain bad advice.

I should've just told you
that you shouldn't worry about her.

He was more in love with you than... ever.

It would've been really cool
if you could've told me this a bit earlier.

One more thing. If you wanted to
fuck things up between me and Jonas...

Then why didn't you advise
me to tell Jonas about Chris?

I knew that if you told Jonas
yourself he would have forgiven you.

Do you understand how
messed up that sounds to me?

I feel like I don't know you anymore.

I know it might be hard to believe,
but I never wanted to hurt you. It just turned out that way.

I'm sorry.

Karma's a bitch.

If nothing else...

At least now I know
how Ingrid must've felt.

Hi!
-Hi!

How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

What are you doing?

Just Christmas shopping.

You don't like Christmas shopping.

Who was that?

My sister.

Okay...

I swear!

Okay, I believe you.

Good.

But...
-Yeah?

You told me to call
when I found out who I am.

Yes.

Do you want to meet?

Yes, of course. When?

Now you're probably going to
smoke marijuana with Ingrid's brother.

That's not true.
-Come in the morning.

Yeah, tomorrow suits me.

Good.

We'll talk then. Bye.

Hi.
-Hi.

Tea?
-Yeah.

That was warm.

Do you remember the first time we kissed?

Why are you laughing?
-Of course I remember that.

Yeah? What do you remember?

What do I remember?

Yeah.

What is it?
-It's a bit weird.

No. Say it.

The thing is that I didn't
know you felt the same thing I did.

Since you were best friends with
my girl, it was a big risk to take.

If it didn't go well,
it would have been really weird.

So I just waited for a sign.

What kind of sign?

A sign that I should kiss you.

And you know the Take Me to Church
song they played all the time?

Yes.

I kept thinking if that was
the next song that came on, I should go fot it.

So did it come on?

No, it didn't.

They played this Kygo shit...

But then it was you who kissed me.

It was me who kissed you.

What you didn't know,
was that I thought the exact same thing as you.

Oh yeah?

I need to have a sign.

If the next song was Kygo,
I would kiss you.

So funny.

But that was not why you kissed me, was it?

No.

That wasn't why.

I kissed you because
I couldn't help myself.

It wasn't like I was with
you just because it seemed cool.

No?

No.

You accusing me of that,
actually angered me a little.

It felt like I had to
give up everything to be with you.

I ditched my best friends.

So when you said
I just do what others think is cool...

... and that I don't have my
own opinion, it's really unfair.

Because it's not true.

Because I chose you.

And it was a really stupid choice.

But at least I didn't
do it to be popular.

A really stupid choice?

Yes.

A really stupid choice.

Because it made me feel like shit.

I walked around paranoid all the time
because I thought there might be something betwen you two.

I thought that if you and
I could do something like that to Ingrid...

... you could do the same thing to me.

You understand?

Maybe I thought I deserved it.

And so I became insecure and desperate.

Your opinion meant more than my own.

That's not how it should be.

No.

I have to find out...

... what my own opinion is.

And I have to do it on my own.

Do we break up now?

I think so.

Is that what you want?

Yes.

Right now...

... this seems like the most important thing.

As if nothing else has meaning.

Then we'll just lie here for now.

Hello.
-Hi.

Me and Jonas broke up.

I just thought I should tell you.

Are you okay?

Hi!

Hi!

Have you seen Vilde?

Eh, no.

But she should be coming, right?

Yeah, I think so.

Okay, can I just borrow your phone?

Yes.

My battery's empty.

In 2015? Is there no one
who has functioning technology?

Thanks.

Do you have Vilde's number?

No, I don't.

Hi!
-Hi!

I just want to say Merry Christmas.

Yes, Merry Christmas!

Vilde!

Hi!

Noora is looking for you like crazy.
-Why?

I'm sure she's scared
you've blacked out somewhere.

Really funny!

Vilde?

Hey.
-Hi.

Remember when I said you weren't good enough?

That was bullshit.

You're more than good enough.

Anyone who says otherwise, is an asshole.
Including me. Okay?

Okay.

What just happened?

I have to tell Chris and Sana!

Hey you.

I found Vilde. You're never going
to guess what just happened.

I just thought of something. Remember
when you told me it was a little weird...

... when Isak said he has feelings for you.

Eh, yes.

Because...

I just think that maybe it's
not you he has feelings for.

You really don't remember
what happened last year?

- School. Now.
- I dropped out.

You'll get your diploma,
I'll get mine.

- What you doing?
- Studying.

You taking your GED?
All right, Fi!

Estefania.
Fiona.

You married
a druglord's daughter?

I'm not in love with her.

That's good, 'cause she
doesn't love you either.

She's got this other guy.
Marco... somebody.

Marco, you're me now.
Take my identity.

And if Este's dad
comes looking for you,

she'll still be married
to Steve Wilton.

We can't have sex anymore.

I'm pretty sure
that Jody's gonna propose.

You're better than this guy,
Karen.

Stay the fuck away from me,

and stay the fuck away
from this baby!

Is it all right
if I stay over tonight?

Couldn't go 12 hours
without seeing me, could you?

Went to the clinic today,
said me having kids...

not likely.

No one said
that we have to stop trying.

Hello, boys.

We got nothing
to be ashamed of.

What fucking world
do you live in?

Officer, oink, oink!

- Does this violate my probation?
- Shut up!

- Laughing
- Screams

- Is it the baby?
- No!

It's you!
Get out!

I really am so sorry
about all of this with Karen.

You deserve better.

Congratulations, my boy.
You hit the jackpot.

- Frank!
- What?

I think you should go.

Why don't you just live
at your real home

with your real family?

I don't like them,
and they don't like me.

Hey, stop that!
Hey, hey!

Please just go.
Leave.

Mind if I sleep here
for the night?

Hey, that's no problem for me.

Back to being a legal resident
around here, Steve?

His name is Jimmy now.

Steve was just an alias he used
to lie to me

about who he really was.

I wanna meet your family.

Sorry to be late.

These are Fiona's brothers,
Carl and Ian.

- Do they know you're gay?
- I'm not gay.

Really?

Screaming
It's coming! It's coming!

Doctor.

What's wrong with him?

- He has down's syndrome, Debs.
- Yeah, and he's Asian.

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

- It's me or the baby.
- The baby, sweetheart.

Know you're gonna regret this.

I love you.

- Are you gonna leave?
- No.

Everybody always leaves.

I won't.

Already fed and gone.

Why are you eating
a popsicle for breakfast?

Jimmy said it was okay.

I've got your smoothie
ready to go.

Where's Debbie?

Out front like always.

?

Morning, Debs.

137 days.

When I was nine,
he was gone for a year.

He always comes back.

Lunch.

He'll be back, Debs.

He always comes back.

Hey, Speaking Spanish sir.

Hey! Speaking Spanish Get up!

Speaking Spanish Get up!
You can't sleep here.

Hey!

Speaking Spanish Come on. Come on.
Get up! Come on, quickly! Get up, get up!

Speaking Spanish
Quickly, quickly.

Speaking Spanish - Get the hell out.
- All right.

Speaking Spanish - Now!
- Yeah.

Speaking Spanish
Let's pray...

Hey.
Can you help me?

Sir.
You need help?

Yes, thank you.

- Where am I?
- Juarez.

- Mexico?
- Speaking Spanish Yes.

- Did I miss Christmas?
- Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

There's an Escalade
parked across the street

with someone in it.

- Oh?
- It's nice.

Still has its hubcaps.

I think it was there
yesterday too.

- Popsicle for breakfast?
- Carl's teeth hurt.

Yeah, 'cause he's eating
popsicles for breakfast.

Did he brush
before he left for school?

Yeah, think so.

Did you check his toothbrush
to see if it was wet?

Mm, I was hoping

that you'd still be in bed

when the kids left for school.

I have to work.

- You've got five minutes.
- Five?

I'll make it ten if I focus

on the white sox box scores
or something.

Liam?

Just plop him down in front
of the wiggles,

he's good for hours.

I can't be late.

I can't be late!

I need the cash
for the property tax bill.

Sniffs

Please don't tell my kids

they can do things
they know they can't.

- Your kids?
- A popsicle?

So I'm just the nanny?

I can feed them, change them,

but when Carl
wants a second popsicle...

A second popsicle?

Didn't like the first one.
Banana.

His teeth are gonna rot
out of his head.

We just spent 2 grand
on his braces.

We?

What?

Not... we.

Me.
I paid for Carl's braces.

No more popsicles
for breakfast, okay?

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had to pick
something up downtown

- before school.
- Downtown?

What they said.

Pick up what?

Go, go, go, go!

When you said you had access
to the building,

I thought you meant
through a door!

I may have fudged
on that a bit.

Hey!

Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

- Get out of the way!
- Stop!

Jesus, whatever happened
to fat, doughnut-eating cops?

Now they're all triathletes.

Catch!

The tall prick looks good
for another 10 miles.

Aah!

Shit!

Ditch out at the street, yeah?

Wait, wait, wait!
Maybe they'll give up.

What are you doing?

Shit, shit!

Whoa!
Whoa.

Right there!
Hold it!

No way West Point takes you
with a felony conviction.

Hey!

Catch you
at the courthouse later?

Don't be stupid!

Call Mandy, all right?

Milkovich has gotta have
a good bail-bondsman.

Screams

Baby fussing

Baby.

Baby crying

Baby.

It's your turn.

I know you're awake.

You're making
that fakey sleep sound.

I was up at 3:00 and 5:00.

Get your ass up,

you goddamn pony-tailed
Fabio motherfucker!

What?

Get your goddamn ass
out of this bed!

It's your fucking turn!

Is someone tearing
his flesh off?

You sure this Ferber dude knows

what the hell
he's talking about?

Go!

Crying stops

 Hush, little baby,
don't say a word

Crying continues, drumming

 Papa's gonna buy you
a mockingbird

 if that mockingbird
don't sing

Stop it!

Singing in Spanish

?

Excuse me.
Medi-medi-medical emergency.

Good morning.

Passport?

Ah, yeah, um...

No.

Must have left 'em
in my other pants.

But I'm an American citizen.
Chi-town, born and raised.

No passport, no entry.

What?
Since when?

Since Al Qaeda decided
Americans needed killing.

See, here's the thing,

Agent Tacker.

You look like a man

who occasionally enjoys
a malt beverage,

so you can understand,

every once in a while,

a couple of drinks
can get out of hand.

But when it happens,
the next morning,

you have to pick yourself up,
dust yourself off,

and get right back
on the horse.

Am I right, or am I right?

Just let me cross.
I won't tell anyone.

I promise.

You got a driver's license?

Any form of photo ID?
Costco card?

Do I look
like I've got a Costco card?

You look like you need
a course of penicillin

and a lice comb.

Call home,

get somebody to send you
some kind of photo ID,

so we can use it to make you
a temporary passport.

Get cleaned up.

We're not letting you
into the country,

so you can add to Texas'
homeless population.

Next!

He just walks in,

That's nothing.
Last night, Kev waltzes in,

does his sit-down business
while I'm taking a bath.

Only one bathroom.
Had to go.

We have another bathroom,

but Jimmy can't be bothered
to go downstairs?

Kev once did his poopy business

while I was brushing my teeth.

Only one bathroom.

- Can I steal some of this?
- Sure.

Yesterday,
I caught him vacuuming

and watching Rachel Ray.

Kev doesn't even know
what a vacuum is.

Sure, I do.
Outer space.

Dude in Armageddon got sucked

right out of his space suit,
exploded.

Nice overalls.

$14.50 an hour.

You haven't lived till
you've vacuumed up toxic waste.

Hey, what do you think?
Am I camera ready or what?

Both: Ow!

Grunting

My topless web traffic
is way down.

Too many girls ironing.

If we're going to have a kid,
I need to save up money

for when my tits
are the size of watermelons.

There's probably a market
for pervs

who want to see
a woman nursing.

Kev's worried our kid might
find these online one day.

Whoo! Shit on the net
never goes away.

Kev Junior's gonna be surfing
the net for porn one day

and see his mama's
big titties and get hungry.

So we're trying
a new web thing.

Couple act.
Master and slave.

Wah!

You gonna do it in a cast?

Hey, man's gotta eat.

- That is so wrong.
- It's educational.

By acting out a scene
from the old plantation,

we're providing content
for an internet audience

that embraces a truthful
reenactment of our past.

It's racist and wrong!

Which why it's gonna make money

'cause this country is racist.

What's that all about?

The place we were working
yesterday

had a couple billion fleas.

Jimmy doesn't really
do anything.

He just hangs around the house
all day with Liam,

making smoothies, acting
like he's the kids' new dad.

So he's vacuuming, cooking,
and changing dirty diapers,

and you're still pissed.

I thought that's
what you ladies wanted

is shared housework.

Wage equality
and all that Hunger Games,

Lady Gaga girl power shit.

We say it,
but we don't mean it.

There is nothing sexy
about a man with a mop.

TV prelap

I don't know, tell us.

- At least give us a hint.
- Okay.

Hey, my man.

Guitar plays on TV Huh?

I know.
I've seen it worse.

That's right, Chip.
You guessed it.

Living with someone is hard.

When's the last time
you were with a guy

- for longer than a few weeks?
- Pshh. Never.

Wha--

And how long you been living
with Jimmy, three months?

Four.

Boring happens.
We all get bored.

It'll pass.

He'll stop being boring
again soon.

 Up, up, up

It's been, what,
a couple of months?

Almost a year, your honor.

Turn a new leaf
or just dumb luck?

No, walking the straight
and narrow, Your Honor.

Thanks to the wise counsel
and guidance

previously provided
by this court.

Are you mocking me, Philip?

No, Your Honor, absolutely not.

You know, I have nothing
but respect for this court

and for the rule of law
that it represents.

You know, the rights
that we've derived

from over 900 years of fealty

to the magna carta
are the only things standing

between us and the anarchy
of mob rule.

Hmm. Still a minor.
What a shame.

The defendant before you beat
a co-worker to death

with a nail-studded 2x4

for finishing the coffee
and not starting a new pot.

You show up in this court again

Someone stole all my money

- Hey, hey!

Trouble, Speaking Spanish sir?

What?

Maybe I could help.

Alarm buzzes

Here he comes.

Been up to see Mickey?

It's the only thing
he ever wants.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Thanks, man.
How you doing?

Hey.

Gah! What the fuck?

- Asshole.
- What the hell's that about?

Wasn't too happy to hear
about you getting caught.

Underprivileged kid

All Mandy.

She used
her dad's line of credit

at Bad Bob's bonds.

Miss a hearing,
and my dad will come after you

with a linoleum knife
and a bucket of battery acid.

Hey.

- You knew about this.
- Absolutely not.

I'm shocked and humiliated
by this betrayal.

I can't believe it.

How could she be unfaithful
to me

after everything
we've been through?

_

Better safe than sorry.

Well...

looks like you don't need me
around here anymore.

Put some gloves on.

You get to hold his foot

So my lazy-ass nephew,
my brother Howie's kid

with the big head.

- You remember him from school?
- Howie Jr., sure!

Anyway, he's back from college
for the summer--

- Howie Jr.'s in college?
- Wrestling scholarship.

Majoring in beer pong
and date rape from what I hear.

Anyway, he's back
for the summer,

and he needs a job.

You're a hard worker, but...

blood is blood.

When's Junior back?

That's it?

Call you if anything big
comes up,

and we need some extra hands.

We're almost done here.

Now get your wife dressed,
and go have a nice dinner.

Hmm?

Someplace expensive.

I'll come and join you later.

I only have one shoe.

Take a pair of Marco's.

He always had good taste
in footwear.

No, just toss it in

- GPS wrist unit.

For your ROTC orienting weekends
so you know where you are.

We're supposed to learn that
off of maps and stuff.

Oh, come on.

They teaching you how to use
a sextant too?

Modern infantry officers
have, like, a grand worth

of satellite gear
in their packs.

We need to learn how though

in case we get separated
from our unit

or all that fancy equipment

breaks down
in a harsh environment.

Aw, come on.

Just take it.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Well, I sorta have a wife.

He's been gone for a while,

but he's going to be back
in a couple of weeks.

Young or old?

Young.

Ah.

You up for a threesome, hmm?

I mean, an old guy
can dream, can't he?

Laughing Keep dreaming.

Both laughing Come here.

- Who needs more eggs?
- Me, please!

You came in awfully late
for a school night.

Trig test in a couple weeks,
you know.

Wow. Couldn't find
your pants?

I already made them lunches.

What time do you have
to be at work?

Laid off.

Well, that's all right.
I mean, you hated that job.

Didn't hate the money.

Time to get back in bed
when the kids leave?

Oh, I wish.
I can't, I have a meeting.

Bus is leaving!
Dishes in the sink!

Mandy, do you need a ride?

- Sure, if you got room.
- All right.

- Meeting with who?
- Old friend from last night.

Old friend have a name?

Arnando.
We used to work together.

He came to town unexpectedly.

Used to work together
doing what?

Butcher shop.

Debbie, milk in the fridge!

All right, train's leaving!

Mandy!

I'll be back,
just don't make the bed.

Let's go, Jimmy!

Spanish Hurry!

What now?

Now you go away.

What, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

Hey, I'm thirsty.

- You a quitter, Manuel?
- What?

A quitter?
Little baby quitter?

I'll give you $1,000.

You already promised
to give me five.

That or let me cut out
a kidney to sell.

Well, that was
before I realized

that you were
a little pansy quitter.

- Ah!
- Stay away from me, asshole!

Now that is the spirit
that I've been looking for,

but let's channel it
into something constructive,

like getting me on the other
side of the Rio Grande.

How bad do you want
to get back?

It's "badly," but yes, bad!

Come, amigo.

Let me introduce you
to my friend El Cuchillo.

- El Cuchillo.
- Yeah.

- Cuchillo. Cuchillo.
- Let's go.

Now I'm gonna perform lasix on
near-sighted neighborhood kids.

50 bucks a pop.

What are you doing this summer?

Probably pretty much
what I did last summer--

drink too much beer,
smoke a lot of weed.

Yeah.

Well, that ain't gonna work.

You got to pad your resume for
your college apps this summer.

You're a poor kid
from the South Side.

And you got a 4.6,
and that's great,

but you're gonna need
a full ride.

What's so goddamn funny?

No, it's just, um...

why does everyone think
I'm going to college?

Dummy,
you are going to college,

and you're gonna graduate.

And then you're gonna
get your masters

and your doctorate.

And then you're gonna make
a boatload of money.

Spend the summer
padding this resume.

Doing what?

I don't give a shit.

Teach brain-damaged kids
how to make plastic explosives

or the blind how to blow glass.

You know what,
I already have my sights set

on a few hundred hours
of community service.

Okay.

That's good.

Get it done.

Courtesy of Cook County
juvenile court system.

You have a 4.6?

My GPA is, like, 1.2.

How smart are you?

- You find anything?
- Nothing I can get with a GED.

Go to Malcolm X.

Take some nurses aide classes
or something.

You got Jimmy playing Mr. Mom,

might as well
take advantage of it.

This Aunt Jemima scarf
too much?

- You gonna be topless?
- Yeah.

No one's gonna be
looking at your head.

How much does
community college cost?

Nothing. Take out of shitload
of student loans,

then bail on the feds
once you get your degree.

Bookkeeping, accounting,

X-ray technician,
dental hygienist.

Yech, I get grossed out
just flossing my teeth.

I've been shoveling sewage
for the last month.

Computer programming.

Drug and alcohol
rehab counselor!

I definitely have the practical
experience for that one.

Crap.

Need a bunch
of psych prerequisites first.

Why don't you take the civil
service exam and get on the ITC?

Drive a bus?

Hey, pension,
health care, paid vacations.

Or there's the Post Office.

Uniforms are for shit.

Everyone looks like they have
a dick in those pants.

Oh, wow, a lot of people
queuing up online for this.

This might just work!

Club's gonna open up
the outdoor patio soon,

maybe Meg would give me
another shot at managing

or at least get
my old job back.

Slinging appletinis?

You didn't need to get your GED

to shake your titties
and collect tips from frat boys.

The money's good,

and it doesn't require
prerequisites.

Requires a couple.

Can you set up the camera,
please?

We're ready to go.

- Who are you supposed to be?
- Thomas Jefferson.

Okay, Miss Sally.

You get your revenge

for me raping you
in the slave quarters.

Ah!

Ooh.

Get down,

Get in there.
Ah!

Hey, Meg.
How are you?

Sure. How you been?

Thought I'd stop by,

see if you were staffing up
for summer yet.

Patio's not open
till Memorial Day,

but if you want to push
cocktails in 6-inch heels,

I can always use another
pretty girl for the summer.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing

like we discussed last fall.

- Congrats.
- Yeah.

I know I screwed you over
last time.

It's a family thing,
my mother was really--

- I get it.
You have it tough.

But fool me once, shame on you.

- Fool me twice--
- I won't let you down again.

Come on, give me one night
to show you what I can do.

You won't regret it.

Give me a thousand bucks.

I'll find you a night
to promote.

- Promote?
- Yeah.

You take over the club,
do it all.

- How about Tuesday the 15th?
- Next week?

Show me what you got.

I don't have $1,000.

So I'll pencil you in
to work the patio.

Give me a call mid-May,
and keep the weight off.

Speaks portuguese
Hey, pretty girl.

- Mimosa?
- Uh, sure.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family, his friends.

His ability to honor
his commitment,

the value of his word.

Eat, please.

I believe
the only true measure of a man

is his willingness to accept
responsibility for his actions.

Don't you agree?

We're here.

Beautiful, very peaceful.

The Great Lakes, right?

Uh, Lake Michigan.

How many Great Lakes are there?

Uh, five.

I knew the Great Lakes
were big,

but I never imagined
they would be this big.

It's like a sea.

Surprisingly heavy for a man
with so few brains.

Speaking portuguese

So, Steve...

Are you a man capable
of honoring your commitments?

Are you a man of your word?

Men speaking Spanish
Come here, let's go.

Cuchillo! Spanish Another moron.

So...
you are an American, eh?

- Yeah.
- Wanting to go home?

But you have no papers.

No, see,
we were sort of partying.

Say "ah."

Ah.
Ah, ah. Ah.

- Speaking Spanish Good.
- Good?

Whoa! No, amigo,
I'm not that kind of girl.

Jesus!

Okay, okay, fellas,

I'm really kinda getting
skeeved out here.

Uh...

Spanish - Everything okay.
- Clean him. Clean this motherfucker.

- Can I-- can I take them--
- Good luck, Spanish little bitch.

What happened to people
paying you when you do the work?

It was just her way
of telling me to go fuck myself.

What really pissed me off
was how she just assumed

that I couldn't come up
with the money.

Smug bitch.

Well, we did all right today
on that master-slave thing.

I could loan you the money
if you want.

No.
That's okay.

I love you, but...

you gotta save up
for when you have a baby.

- What about Jimmy?
- He's being weird.

Meg's right.
I am a loser.

One more ghetto girl
who thinks she's the shit.

I can't manage a club.

- What's that, self-pity?
- No, reality.

I'll take
the civil service exam,

clean bus shelter trash barrels
for the city.

Hey!
You're Fiona Gallagher.

You can do anything
you set your mind to.

You got your GED.

You've been raising a family of
six since you were 15 years old.

You're a rock star,
and Meg's a frigid bitch.

What's that?

My final paycheck.

Looks like
this battle is almost over.

Ooh!

The Red Rovertron
is in trouble.

Cheers and applause

Scorpio back for the win.

Back for yet another round of
ritual humiliation, Gallagher?

Finally gonna win this time,
Goff.

College entrants only today,
it was on the website.

Or don't you have internet
down at MLK charter?

What's the matter, Goff?

You afraid a teenager is gonna
kick the shit out of one

of your half-assed bucket
of bolts?

Chortling Your engineering
can't compete

at the black bot championship
trophy level, Gallagher.

Who'd you steal your designs
from this time?

Was it Carnegie Mellon or MIT?

Entry fee is 150,
and we don't take food stamps.

This match, Scorpio Bot
versus... The Impaler.

Let the battle begin.

Ooh!
The Impaler strikes.

Scorpio Bot is down.

The Impaler wins!

Piece of cake.

Upbeat music

 'cause nobody loves you

? nobody loves you ?
Chuckling

 when you're wearing a frown

?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

How am I supposed
to swallow that?

Who said anything
about swallowing?

She's always been a problem.

It's been a relief to have her

out of the house
these last months.

She was wrecking my marriage.
Pull!

Gunshot, gun cocks

- You lied to me, Steve.
- Yes, well--

but I thought--

You told me you were going
to look after her.

- Yes, well--
- Pull!

I'm sure it's been difficult.
She's a bright girl.

But I spoil her.

I grew up poor, you know.

I want her to have things
I didn't have in the favela--

an education, food...
a toilet.

Pull!
Gunshot

Speaking portuguese

I've arranged for Estefania

to pursue an economics degree

here at the University
of Chicago.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When immigration comes...

you will be her husband.

Pull!

Do you think you can do that
for me, Steve?

Can I trust you?

Absolutely.

But that means
you can't get into any trouble.

No stolen cars, no drugs.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

And the slum girl--
Fiona, yes?

You can fuck her all you want
for fun,

but you're a married man now.

She stays what she is--
a ghetto whore.

In this corner,
the terror of Northwestern U...

Preda Raptor.

And in this corner,

representing the South Side,

Frank!

Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rum-bot!

Thank you.

Let's battle.

Ooh!

Frank is in trouble early.

Fry the fucker, come on.

Ooh!

- Ooh!
- Get outta there! Get out!

What are you doing?

Frank is hit!

Preda Raptor.

- Go! Go, go, go!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

- Now.
- Frank is on the run.

Oh, and it looks like
Frank is down for the count.

- Get outta the way!
- Get out!

- Go! Go!
- I got it!

Preda Raptor,
coming in for the kill.

Cheers and applause

All: Chanting Preda Raptor,

Cheers and applause

He did it!

We have a new champion.

Crowd chanting "Frank"

Welcome home, Mr. Duncan.

Jack!

Jack!

Just keep walking.

No trouble?

They just waved me
right through.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n in person.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n,
your new nickname.

You're already a legend.
18 balloons.

We've never had
more than eight up one ass.

You have more coke up your anus

than any drug mule
in cartel history.

It's like
taking a shit backwards.

Ex-Lax.
Normally, I would say take two,

but for you,
maybe the whole box.

Engine starts

Engine revs

Pop music, indistinct chatter

Awesome.

Tuesday the 15th.
$1,000. It's all there.

No, I'm sure it is.

But, you know, look.

Promoting a new night
is difficult.

- I should've explained to you--
- I want the club.

You've got a bunch
of kids at home.

- I don't think that you should--
- Do I have the club or not?

Okay.

You're on the calendar.

- Okay, hey, grab two.
- All right.

Hey, beautiful!
Dinner's almost ready!

Oh, Jesus, Jimmy!

You always gotta monitor Carl
when he's online.

Okay.

Sure.
I'm sorry.

What the hell
were you watching?

- History Channel.
- Dinner!

Where were you all day?

I was, you know,
running errands...

this and that.
How was your day?

Remember Meg from the club?

She's gonna give me
my own night to promote.

That's great!

Cheering

- You won?
- Oh, yeah.

Oh, nothing left
but smoke and metal

and bruised geek egos.

Yeah, plus 400 bucks
cash prize for first place.

Thought I could help out
a little bit

with the property tax bill.

Do you want me
to run the payment

down to the post office
before school?

No, I got it.

That's still daddy's spot.
Anything at the hospitals?

I forgot to check today, Debs.
I'll call after dinner, okay?

All right, here we go, guys!

Dinner's served.
Can we make way over here?

Thank you, Billy!

Overlapping chatter

It's like a miniature rover,
pretty much,

with battery power, and then we
put a helium laser on top.

It's like cage fighting,
like octagon--

Talking stops

Whispering Daddy.

Daddy!

Talking resumes

Grunting

Packet hits water Sighs

 Well, I've been fooled

 I fooled around

 no sense to lie

 about where I'm bound

Thank you, Sheila!





You really don't remember
what happened last year?

- School. Now.
- I dropped out.

You'll get your diploma,
I'll get mine.

- What you doing?
- Studying.

You taking your GED?
All right, Fi!

Estefania.
Fiona.

You married
a druglord's daughter?

I'm not in love with her.

That's good, 'cause she
doesn't love you either.

She's got this other guy.
Marco... somebody.

Marco, you're me now.
Take my identity.

And if Este's dad
comes looking for you,

she'll still be married
to Steve Wilton.

We can't have sex anymore.

I'm pretty sure
that Jody's gonna propose.

You're better than this guy,
Karen.

Stay the fuck away from me,

and stay the fuck away
from this baby!

Is it all right
if I stay over tonight?

Couldn't go 12 hours
without seeing me, could you?

Went to the clinic today,
said me having kids...

not likely.

No one said
that we have to stop trying.

Hello, boys.

We got nothing
to be ashamed of.

What fucking world
do you live in?

Officer, oink, oink!

- Does this violate my probation?
- Shut up!

- Laughing
- Screams

- Is it the baby?
- No!

It's you!
Get out!

I really am so sorry
about all of this with Karen.

You deserve better.

Congratulations, my boy.
You hit the jackpot.

- Frank!
- What?

I think you should go.

Why don't you just live
at your real home

with your real family?

I don't like them,
and they don't like me.

Hey, stop that!
Hey, hey!

Please just go.
Leave.

Mind if I sleep here
for the night?

Hey, that's no problem for me.

Back to being a legal resident
around here, Steve?

His name is Jimmy now.

Steve was just an alias he used
to lie to me

about who he really was.

I wanna meet your family.

Sorry to be late.

These are Fiona's brothers,
Carl and Ian.

- Do they know you're gay?
- I'm not gay.

Really?

Screaming
It's coming! It's coming!

Doctor.

What's wrong with him?

- He has down's syndrome, Debs.
- Yeah, and he's Asian.

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

- It's me or the baby.
- The baby, sweetheart.

Know you're gonna regret this.

I love you.

- Are you gonna leave?
- No.

Everybody always leaves.

I won't.

- Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

There's an Escalade
parked across the street

with someone in it.

- Oh?
- It's nice.

Still has its hubcaps.

I think it was there
yesterday too.

- Popsicle for breakfast?
- Carl's teeth hurt.

Yeah, 'cause he's eating
popsicles for breakfast.

Did he brush
before he left for school?

Yeah, think so.

Did you check his toothbrush
to see if it was wet?

Mm, I was hoping

that you'd still be in bed

when the kids left for school.

I have to work.

- You've got five minutes.
- Five?

I'll make it ten if I focus

on the white sox box scores
or something.

Liam?

Just plop him down in front
of the wiggles,

he's good for hours.

I can't be late.

I can't be late!

I need the cash
for the property tax bill.

Sniffs

Please don't tell my kids

they can do things
they know they can't.

- Your kids?
- A popsicle?

So I'm just the nanny?

I can feed them, change them,

but when Carl
wants a second popsicle...

A second popsicle?

Didn't like the first one.
Banana.

His teeth are gonna rot
out of his head.

We just spent 2 grand
on his braces.

We?

What?

Not... we.

Me.
I paid for Carl's braces.

No more popsicles
for breakfast, okay?

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had to pick
something up downtown

- before school.
- Downtown?

What they said.

Pick up what?

Go, go, go, go!

When you said you had access
to the building,

I thought you meant
through a door!

I may have fudged
on that a bit.

Hey!

Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

- Get out of the way!
- Stop!

Jesus, whatever happened
to fat, doughnut-eating cops?

Now they're all triathletes.

Aah!

Shit!

Wait, wait, wait!
Maybe they'll give up.

What are you doing?

Passport?

Ah, yeah, um...

No.

Must have left 'em
in my other pants.

But I'm an American citizen.
Chi-town, born and raised.

No passport, no entry.

What?
Since when?

Since Al Qaeda decided
Americans needed killing.

See, here's the thing,

Agent Tacker.

You look like a man

who occasionally enjoys
a malt beverage,

so you can understand,

every once in a while,

a couple of drinks
can get out of hand.

But when it happens,
the next morning,

you have to pick yourself up,
dust yourself off,

and get right back
on the horse.

Am I right, or am I right?

Just let me cross.
I won't tell anyone.

I promise.

You got a driver's license?

Any form of photo ID?
Costco card?

Do I look
like I've got a Costco card?

You look like you need
a course of penicillin

and a lice comb.

Call home,

get somebody to send you
some kind of photo ID,

so we can use it to make you
a temporary passport.

Get cleaned up.

We're not letting you
into the country,

so you can add to Texas'
homeless population.

Last night, Kev waltzes in,

does his sit-down business
while I'm taking a bath.

Only one bathroom.
Had to go.

We have another bathroom,

but Jimmy can't be bothered
to go downstairs?

Kev once did his poopy business

while I was brushing my teeth.

Only one bathroom.

- Can I steal some of this?
- Sure.

Yesterday,
I caught him vacuuming

and watching Rachel Ray.

Kev doesn't even know
what a vacuum is.

Sure, I do.

who want to see
a woman nursing.

Kev's worried our kid might
find these online one day.

Whoo! Shit on the net
never goes away.

Kev Junior's gonna be surfing
the net for porn one day

and see his mama's
big titties and get hungry.

So we're trying
a new web thing.

Couple act.
Master and slave.

Wah!

You gonna do it in a cast?

Hey, man's gotta eat.

- That is so wrong.
- It's educational.

By acting out a scene
from the old plantation,

we're providing content
for an internet audience

that embraces a truthful
reenactment of our past.

It's racist and wrong!

Which why it's gonna make money

'cause this country is racist.

What's that all about?

The place we were working
yesterday

had a couple billion fleas.

Jimmy doesn't really
do anything.

He just hangs around the house
all day with Liam,

making smoothies, acting
like he's the kids' new dad.

So he's vacuuming, cooking,
and changing dirty diapers,

and you're still pissed.

I thought that's
what you ladies wanted

is shared housework.

Wage equality
and all that Hunger Games,

Lady Gaga girl power shit.

We say it,
but we don't mean it.

There is nothing sexy
about a man with a mop.

- At least give us a hint.
- Okay.

Hey, my man.

Guitar plays on TV Huh?

I know.
I've seen it worse.

You guessed it.

Living with someone is hard.

When's the last time
you were with a guy

- for longer than a few weeks?
- Pshh. Never.

Wha--

And how long you been living
with Jimmy, three months?

Four.

Boring happens.
We all get bored.

It'll pass.

He'll stop being boring

No, walking the straight

Are you mocking me, Philip?

No, Your Honor, absolutely not.

You know, I have nothing
but respect for this court

that it represents.

You know, the rights
that we've derived

from over 900 years of fealty

Hmm. Still a minor.

Miss a hearing,

with a linoleum knife
and a bucket of battery acid.

Hey.

- You knew about this.
- Absolutely not.

I'm shocked and humiliated
by this betrayal.

I can't believe it.

How could she be unfaithful

after everything
we've been through?

Anyway, he's back

You're a hard worker, but...

When's Junior back?

That's it?

Call you if anything big
comes up,

Move, move, motherfucker.

That was Central America.
Okay, I'm going.

Voices inside

What's that?

It's a miniature Mars rover.

I'm mounting
a helium-neon laser on it.

We're gonna blow shit up
with it.

Hey!
Language.

Oh, hey, final notice
on the property tax.

You going down there tomorrow?

- Later.
- Where you going?

Study group.

- No dinner?
- No Jimmy.

No cookies after school either.

He wasn't here
when you came home from school?

No, and his Beamer's
still out front.

Want me to open a can of tuna?

Sure.

Would you mind
getting that one for me?

Whiskey.
I need whiskey.

- Shh.
- We have to stay hydrated.

The sun's almost down.
It's not hot.

How much further?

20 miles to the rendezvous.

- How far have we gone so far?
- Two. Speaking Spanish Relax!

Could we stop for a second?

I think I'm getting a blister.

No, seriously.
I'm wearing the wrong shoes.

Anybody have a band-aid?

Did you check
the hospitals today?

No Frank.

_

Okay, Debs, come on.
Time for bed.

He'll come back, Debs.

Frank's like scabies.

You can't get rid of him
no matter how hard you try.

Knocking on door

Sighs

Bedtime.

Ian?

Mandy?

Yeah, her dad's mixing vodka
and speedballs again, so...

You being smart?

Lost my job today.

What, you fucking the boss?

Nah. Nepotism.
Nephew.

Hey, uh...

we gonna have enough
for the property tax bill?

Just.
With the check I got today.

- Where you been?
- Hey.

I just ran into a friend,
grabbed dinner.

- What are you doing?
- Just burning my clothes.

- Why?
- Ah, you don't need to know.

- I don't?
- Nope.

Sighs

Take a shower.

Scrub my back?

You want me to scrub your back?

Alternative music

Giggling

 Waiting there for me

Both laughing

Both: Oh!

 I won't ever be alone again

 someday in the future

Mmm.
No, no.

Use Euler's.

- Where? Here?
- Oh, come on.

Cosine X.

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

Hey.

Catch.

Open it.

- What is it?
- GPS wrist unit.

For your ROTC orienting weekends
so you know where you are.

We're supposed to learn that
off of maps and stuff.

Oh, come on.

They teaching you how to use
a sextant too?

Modern infantry officers
have, like, a grand worth

of satellite gear
in their packs.

We need to learn how though

in case we get separated
from our unit

or all that fancy equipment

breaks down
in a harsh environment.

Aw, come on.

Just take it.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Well, I sorta have a wife.

He's been gone for a while,

but he's going to be back
in a couple of weeks.

Young or old?

Young.

Ah.

You up for a threesome, hmm?

I mean, an old guy
can dream, can't he?

Laughing Keep dreaming.

Both laughing Come here.

- Who needs more eggs?
- Me, please!

You came in awfully late
for a school night.

Trig test in a couple weeks,
you know.

Wow. Couldn't find
your pants?

I already made them lunches.

What time do you have
to be at work?

Laid off.

Well, that's all right.
I mean, you hated that job.

Didn't hate the money.

Time to get back in bed
when the kids leave?

Oh, I wish.
I can't, I have a meeting.

Bus is leaving!
Dishes in the sink!

Mandy, do you need a ride?

- Sure, if you got room.
- All right.

- Meeting with who?
- Old friend from last night.

Old friend have a name?

Arnando.
We used to work together.

He came to town unexpectedly.

Used to work together
doing what?

Butcher shop.

Debbie, milk in the fridge!

All right, train's leaving!

Mandy!

I'll be back,
just don't make the bed.

Let's go, Jimmy!

Spanish Hurry!

What now?

Now you go away.

What, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

Hey, I'm thirsty.

- You a quitter, Manuel?
- What?

A quitter?
Little baby quitter?

I'll give you $1,000.

You already promised
to give me five.

That or let me cut out
a kidney to sell.

Well, that was
before I realized

that you were
a little pansy quitter.

- Ah!
- Stay away from me, asshole!

Now that is the spirit
that I've been looking for,

but let's channel it
into something constructive,

like getting me on the other
side of the Rio Grande.

How bad do you want
to get back?

It's "badly," but yes, bad!

Come, amigo.

Let me introduce you
to my friend El Cuchillo.

- El Cuchillo.
- Yeah.

- Cuchillo. Cuchillo.
- Let's go.

The Knife?

Your sister doesn't like me.

No, she's just worried
I'm gonna knock you up,

doesn't want any more
Gallagher mouths to feed.

I'm not my mom.

13 with my brother on her hip.

13, huh?

12 when she got pregnant.

What the hell is that?

This?
This is a helium-neon laser.

Now I'm gonna perform lasix on
near-sighted neighborhood kids.

50 bucks a pop.

What are you doing this summer?

Probably pretty much
what I did last summer--

drink too much beer,
smoke a lot of weed.

Yeah.

Well, that ain't gonna work.

You got to pad your resume for
your college apps this summer.

You're a poor kid
from the South Side.

And you got a 4.6,
and that's great,

but you're gonna need
a full ride.

What's so goddamn funny?

No, it's just, um...

why does everyone think
I'm going to college?

Dummy,
you are going to college,

and you're gonna graduate.

And then you're gonna
get your masters

and your doctorate.

And then you're gonna make
a boatload of money.

Spend the summer
padding this resume.

Doing what?

I don't give a shit.

Teach brain-damaged kids
how to make plastic explosives

or the blind how to blow glass.

You know what,
I already have my sights set

on a few hundred hours
of community service.

Okay.

That's good.

Get it done.

Courtesy of Cook County
juvenile court system.

You have a 4.6?

My GPA is, like, 1.2.

How smart are you?

- You find anything?
- Nothing I can get with a GED.

Go to Malcolm X.

Take some nurses aide classes
or something.

You got Jimmy playing Mr. Mom,

might as well
take advantage of it.

This Aunt Jemima scarf
too much?

- You gonna be topless?
- Yeah.

No one's gonna be
looking at your head.

How much does
community college cost?

Nothing. Take out of shitload
of student loans,

then bail on the feds
once you get your degree.

Bookkeeping, accounting,

X-ray technician,
dental hygienist.

Yech, I get grossed out
just flossing my teeth.

I've been shoveling sewage
for the last month.

Computer programming.

Drug and alcohol
rehab counselor!

I definitely have the practical
experience for that one.

Crap.

Need a bunch
of psych prerequisites first.

Why don't you take the civil
service exam and get on the ITC?

Drive a bus?

Hey, pension,
health care, paid vacations.

Or there's the Post Office.

Uniforms are for shit.

Everyone looks like they have
a dick in those pants.

Oh, wow, a lot of people
queuing up online for this.

This might just work!

Club's gonna open up
the outdoor patio soon,

maybe Meg would give me
another shot at managing

or at least get
my old job back.

Slinging appletinis?

You didn't need to get your GED

to shake your titties
and collect tips from frat boys.

The money's good,

and it doesn't require
prerequisites.

Requires a couple.

Can you set up the camera,
please?

We're ready to go.

- Who are you supposed to be?
- Thomas Jefferson.

Okay, Miss Sally.

You get your revenge

for me raping you
in the slave quarters.

Master.

Ah!

Ooh.

Get down,
you white motherfucker.

Get in there.
Ah!

Yeah, now get that ass.
Munch it, munch it!

Do the alphabet.

We shall overcome,
motherfucker.

Get in there!

We shall overcome!
Screaming

Motor starting

Get on.

Hey, Meg.
How are you?

Fiona...
Gallagher.

Sure. How you been?

Thought I'd stop by,

see if you were staffing up
for summer yet.

Patio's not open
till Memorial Day,

but if you want to push
cocktails in 6-inch heels,

I can always use another
pretty girl for the summer.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing

like we discussed last fall.

- Congrats.
- Yeah.

I know I screwed you over
last time.

It's a family thing,
my mother was really--

- I get it.
You have it tough.

But fool me once, shame on you.

- Fool me twice--
- I won't let you down again.

Come on, give me one night
to show you what I can do.

You won't regret it.

Give me a thousand bucks.

I'll find you a night
to promote.

- Promote?
- Yeah.

You take over the club,
do it all.

- How about Tuesday the 15th?
- Next week?

Show me what you got.

I don't have $1,000.

So I'll pencil you in
to work the patio.

Give me a call mid-May,
and keep the weight off.

Speaks portuguese
Hey, pretty girl.

- Mimosa?
- Uh, sure.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family, his friends.

His ability to honor
his commitment,

the value of his word.

Eat, please.

I believe
the only true measure of a man

is his willingness to accept
responsibility for his actions.

Don't you agree?

We're here.

Beautiful, very peaceful.

The Great Lakes, right?

Uh, Lake Michigan.

How many Great Lakes are there?

Uh, five.

I knew the Great Lakes
were big,

but I never imagined
they would be this big.

It's like a sea.

Surprisingly heavy for a man
with so few brains.

Speaking portuguese

So, Steve...

Are you a man capable
of honoring your commitments?

Are you a man of your word?

Men speaking Spanish
Come here, let's go.

Cuchillo! Spanish Another moron.

So...
you are an American, eh?

- Yeah.
- Wanting to go home?

But you have no papers.

No, see,
we were sort of partying.

Say "ah."

Ah.
Ah, ah. Ah.

- Speaking Spanish Good.
- Good?

Whoa! No, amigo,
I'm not that kind of girl.

Jesus!

Okay, okay, fellas,

I'm really kinda getting
skeeved out here.

Uh...

Spanish - Everything okay.
- Clean him. Clean this motherfucker.

- Can I-- can I take them--
- Good luck, Spanish little bitch.

What happened to people
paying you when you do the work?

It was just her way
of telling me to go fuck myself.

What really pissed me off
was how she just assumed

that I couldn't come up
with the money.

Smug bitch.

Well, we did all right today
on that master-slave thing.

I could loan you the money
if you want.

No.
That's okay.

I love you, but...

you gotta save up
for when you have a baby.

- What about Jimmy?
- He's being weird.

Meg's right.
I am a loser.

One more ghetto girl
who thinks she's the shit.

I can't manage a club.

- What's that, self-pity?
- No, reality.

I'll take
the civil service exam,

clean bus shelter trash barrels
for the city.

Hey!
You're Fiona Gallagher.

You can do anything
you set your mind to.

You got your GED.

You've been raising a family of
six since you were 15 years old.

You're a rock star,
and Meg's a frigid bitch.

What's that?

My final paycheck.

Looks like
this battle is almost over.

Ooh!

The Red Rovertron
is in trouble.

Cheers and applause

Scorpio back for the win.

Back for yet another round of
ritual humiliation, Gallagher?

Finally gonna win this time,
Goff.

College entrants only today,
it was on the website.

Or don't you have internet
down at MLK charter?

What's the matter, Goff?

You afraid a teenager is gonna
kick the shit out of one

of your half-assed bucket
of bolts?

Chortling Your engineering
can't compete

at the black bot championship
trophy level, Gallagher.

Who'd you steal your designs
from this time?

Was it Carnegie Mellon or MIT?

Entry fee is 150,
and we don't take food stamps.

This match, Scorpio Bot
versus... The Impaler.

Let the battle begin.

Ooh!
The Impaler strikes.

Scorpio Bot is down.

The Impaler wins!

Piece of cake.

Upbeat music

?

 gotta be up

 gotta be up and on

 'cause nobody loves you

 when you're wearing a frown

? nobody loves you ?
Chuckling

 when you're wearing a frown

?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

How am I supposed
to swallow that?

Who said anything
about swallowing?

She's always been a problem.

It's been a relief to have her

out of the house
these last months.

She was wrecking my marriage.
Pull!

Gunshot, gun cocks

- You lied to me, Steve.
- Yes, well--

but I thought--

You told me you were going
to look after her.

- Yes, well--
- Pull!

I'm sure it's been difficult.
She's a bright girl.

But I spoil her.

I grew up poor, you know.

I want her to have things
I didn't have in the favela--

an education, food...
a toilet.

Pull!
Gunshot

Speaking portuguese

I've arranged for Estefania

to pursue an economics degree

here at the University
of Chicago.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When immigration comes...

you will be her husband.

Pull!

Do you think you can do that
for me, Steve?

Can I trust you?

Absolutely.

But that means
you can't get into any trouble.

No stolen cars, no drugs.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

And the slum girl--
Fiona, yes?

You can fuck her all you want
for fun,

but you're a married man now.

She stays what she is--
a ghetto whore.

In this corner,
the terror of Northwestern U...

Preda Raptor.

And in this corner,

representing the South Side,

Frank!

Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rum-bot!

Rock music

?

Next.

Thank you.

Let's battle.

Ooh!

Frank is in trouble early.

Fry the fucker, come on.

Ooh!
Audience ohs

- Ooh!
- Get outta there! Get out!

What are you doing?

Frank is hit!

Preda Raptor.

- Go! Go, go, go!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

- Now.
- Frank is on the run.

Oh, and it looks like
Frank is down for the count.

- Get outta the way!
- Get out!

- Go! Go!
- I got it!

Preda Raptor,
coming in for the kill.

Cheers and applause

All: Chanting Preda Raptor,
Preda Raptor,

Preda Raptor, Preda Raptor,
Preda Raptor!

Cheers and applause

He did it!
He... did... it!

We have a new champion.

Crowd chanting "Frank"

Welcome home, Mr. Duncan.

Jack!

Jack!

Just keep walking.

No trouble?

They just waved me
right through.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n in person.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n,
your new nickname.

You're already a legend.
18 balloons.

We've never had
more than eight up one ass.

You have more coke up your anus

than any drug mule
in cartel history.

It's like
taking a shit backwards.

Ex-Lax.
Normally, I would say take two,

but for you,
maybe the whole box.

Engine starts

Engine revs

Pop music, indistinct chatter

Awesome.

Tuesday the 15th.
$1,000. It's all there.

No, I'm sure it is.

But, you know, look.

Promoting a new night
is difficult.

- I should've explained to you--
- I want the club.

You've got a bunch
of kids at home.

- I don't think that you should--
- Do I have the club or not?

Okay.

You're on the calendar.

- Okay, hey, grab two.
- All right.

Hey, beautiful!
Dinner's almost ready!

Oh, Jesus, Jimmy!

You always gotta monitor Carl
when he's online.

Okay.

Sure.
I'm sorry.

What the hell
were you watching?

- History Channel.
- Dinner!

Where were you all day?

I was, you know,
running errands...

this and that.
How was your day?

Remember Meg from the club?

She's gonna give me
my own night to promote.

That's great!

Cheering

- You won?
- Oh, yeah.

Oh, nothing left
but smoke and metal

and bruised geek egos.

Yeah, plus 400 bucks
cash prize for first place.

Thought I could help out
a little bit

with the property tax bill.

Do you want me
to run the payment

down to the post office
before school?

No, I got it.

That's still daddy's spot.
Anything at the hospitals?

I forgot to check today, Debs.
I'll call after dinner, okay?

All right, here we go, guys!

Dinner's served.
Can we make way over here?

Thank you, Billy!

Overlapping chatter

It's like a miniature rover,
pretty much,

with battery power, and then we
put a helium laser on top.

It's like cage fighting,
like octagon--

Talking stops

Whispering Daddy.

Daddy!

Talking resumes

Grunting

Packet hits water Sighs

 Well, I've been fooled

 I fooled around

 no sense to lie

 about where I'm bound

19!

Thank you, Sheila!





You really don't remember
what happened last year?

- School. Now.
- I dropped out.

You'll get your diploma,
I'll get mine.

- What you doing?
- Studying.

You taking your GED?
All right, Fi!

Estefania.
Fiona.

You married
a druglord's daughter?

I'm not in love with her.

That's good, 'cause she
doesn't love you either.

She's got this other guy.
Marco... somebody.

Marco, you're me now.
Take my identity.

And if Este's dad
comes looking for you,

she'll still be married
to Steve Wilton.

We can't have sex anymore.

I'm pretty sure
that Jody's gonna propose.

You're better than this guy,
Karen.

Stay the fuck away from me,

and stay the fuck away
from this baby!

Is it all right
if I stay over tonight?

Couldn't go 12 hours
without seeing me, could you?

Went to the clinic today,
said me having kids...

not likely.

No one said
that we have to stop trying.

Hello, boys.

We got nothing
to be ashamed of.

What fucking world
do you live in?

Officer, oink, oink!

- Does this violate my probation?
- Shut up!

- Laughing
- Screams

- Is it the baby?
- No!

It's you!
Get out!

I really am so sorry
about all of this with Karen.

You deserve better.

Congratulations, my boy.
You hit the jackpot.

- Frank!
- What?

I think you should go.

Why don't you just live
at your real home

with your real family?

I don't like them,
and they don't like me.

Hey, stop that!
Hey, hey!

Please just go.
Leave.

Mind if I sleep here
for the night?

Hey, that's no problem for me.

Back to being a legal resident
around here, Steve?

His name is Jimmy now.

Steve was just an alias he used
to lie to me

about who he really was.

I wanna meet your family.

Sorry to be late.

These are Fiona's brothers,
Carl and Ian.

- Do they know you're gay?
- I'm not gay.

Really?

Screaming
It's coming! It's coming!

Doctor.

What's wrong with him?

- He has down's syndrome, Debs.
- Yeah, and he's Asian.

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

- It's me or the baby.
- The baby, sweetheart.

Know you're gonna regret this.

I love you.

- Are you gonna leave?
- No.

Everybody always leaves.

I won't.

Already done.

My man, would you like
some more French toast?

- Uh-huh.
- Lip and Ian?

Already fed and gone.

Why are you eating

Jimmy said it was okay.

I've got your smoothie

- Did I miss Christmas?
- Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

There's an Escalade
parked across the street

with someone in it.

- Oh?
- It's nice.

Still has its hubcaps.

I think it was there
yesterday too.

- Popsicle for breakfast?
- Carl's teeth hurt.

Yeah, 'cause he's eating
popsicles for breakfast.

Did he brush
before he left for school?

Yeah, think so.

Did you check his toothbrush
to see if it was wet?

Mm, I was hoping

that you'd still be in bed

when the kids left for school.

I have to work.

- You've got five minutes.
- Five?

I'll make it ten if I focus

on the white sox box scores
or something.

Liam?

Just plop him down in front
of the wiggles,

he's good for hours.

I can't be late.

I can't be late!

I need the cash
for the property tax bill.

Please don't tell my kids

they can do things
they know they can't.

- Your kids?
- A popsicle?

So I'm just the nanny?

I can feed them, change them,

but when Carl
wants a second popsicle...

A second popsicle?

Didn't like the first one.
Banana.

His teeth are gonna rot
out of his head.

We just spent 2 grand
on his braces.

We?

What?

Not... we.

Me.
I paid for Carl's braces.

No more popsicles
for breakfast, okay?

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had to pick
something up downtown

- before school.
- Downtown?

What they said.

Pick up what?

Go, go, go, go!

When you said you had access
to the building,

I thought you meant
through a door!

I may have fudged
on that a bit.

Hey!

Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

- Get out of the way!
- Stop!

Jesus, whatever happened
to fat, doughnut-eating cops?

Now they're all triathletes.

for another 10 miles.

Aah!

Shit!

Ditch out at the street, yeah?

Wait, wait, wait!
Maybe they'll give up.

What are you doing?

Shit, shit!

Whoa!
Whoa.

You look like a man

who occasionally enjoys
a malt beverage,

so you can understand,

every once in a while,

a couple of drinks
can get out of hand.

But when it happens,
the next morning,

you have to pick yourself up,
dust yourself off,

and get right back
on the horse.

Am I right, or am I right?

Just let me cross.
I won't tell anyone.

I promise.

You got a driver's license?

Any form of photo ID?
Costco card?

Do I look
like I've got a Costco card?

You look like you need
a course of penicillin

and a lice comb.

Call home,

get somebody to send you
some kind of photo ID,

so we can use it to make you
a temporary passport.

Get cleaned up.

We're not letting you
into the country,

so you can add to Texas'
homeless population.

Next!

He just walks in,
doesn't even bother to knock!

That's nothing.
Last night, Kev waltzes in,

does his sit-down business
while I'm taking a bath.

Only one bathroom.
Had to go.

We have another bathroom,

but Jimmy can't be bothered
to go downstairs?

Kev once did his poopy business

while I was brushing my teeth.

Only one bathroom.

- Can I steal some of this?
- Sure.

Yesterday,
I caught him vacuuming

and watching Rachel Ray.

Kev doesn't even know
what a vacuum is.

Sure, I do.
Outer space.

Dude in Armageddon got sucked

right out of his space suit,
exploded.

Nice overalls.

$14.50 an hour.

You haven't lived till
you've vacuumed up toxic waste.

Hey, what do you think?
Am I camera ready or what?

Both: Ow!

Grunting

My topless web traffic
is way down.

Too many girls ironing.

If we're going to have a kid,
I need to save up money

for when my tits
are the size of watermelons.

There's probably a market
for pervs

who want to see
a woman nursing.

Kev's worried our kid might
find these online one day.

Whoo! Shit on the net
never goes away.

Kev Junior's gonna be surfing
the net for porn one day

and see his mama's
big titties and get hungry.

So we're trying
a new web thing.

Couple act.
Master and slave.

Wah!

You gonna do it in a cast?

Hey, man's gotta eat.

- That is so wrong.
- It's educational.

By acting out a scene
from the old plantation,

we're providing content
for an internet audience

that embraces a truthful
reenactment of our past.

It's racist and wrong!

Which why it's gonna make money

'cause this country is racist.

What's that all about?

The place we were working
yesterday

had a couple billion fleas.

Jimmy doesn't really
do anything.

He just hangs around the house
all day with Liam,

making smoothies, acting
like he's the kids' new dad.

So he's vacuuming, cooking,
and changing dirty diapers,

and you're still pissed.

I thought that's
what you ladies wanted

is shared housework.

Wage equality
and all that Hunger Games,

Lady Gaga girl power shit.

We say it,
but we don't mean it.

There is nothing sexy
about a man with a mop.

TV prelap

I don't know, tell us.

- At least give us a hint.
- Okay.

Hey, my man.

Guitar plays on TV Huh?

I know.
I've seen it worse.

That's right, Chip.
You guessed it.

Living with someone is hard.

When's the last time
you were with a guy

- for longer than a few weeks?
- Pshh. Never.

Wha--

And how long you been living
with Jimmy, three months?

Four.

Boring happens.
We all get bored.

It'll pass.

He'll stop being boring
again soon.

 Up, up, up

It's been, what,

Almost a year, your honor.

Turn a new leaf
or just dumb luck?

No, walking the straight
and narrow, Your Honor.

Thanks to the wise counsel
and guidance

previously provided
by this court.

Are you mocking me, Philip?

No, Your Honor, absolutely not.

You know, I have nothing
but respect for this court

and for the rule of law
that it represents.

You know, the rights
that we've derived

from over 900 years of fealty

to the magna carta
are the only things standing

between us and the anarchy
of mob rule.

Hmm. Still a minor.
What a shame.

The defendant before you beat
a co-worker to death

with a nail-studded 2x4

for finishing the coffee

You show up in this court again

How you doing?

Miss a hearing,

with a linoleum knife
and a bucket of battery acid.

Hey.

- You knew about this.
- Absolutely not.

I'm shocked and humiliated
by this betrayal.

I can't believe it.

How could she be unfaithful

after everything
we've been through?

- You remember him from school?
- Howie Jr., sure!

Anyway, he's back from college
for the summer--

- Howie Jr.'s in college?
- Wrestling scholarship.

Majoring in beer pong
and date rape from what I hear.

Anyway, he's back
for the summer,

and he needs a job.

You're a hard worker, but...

blood is blood.

When's Junior back?

That's it?

Call you if anything big
comes up,

and we need some extra hands.

We're almost done here.

Now get your wife dressed,
and go have a nice dinner.

Hmm?

Someplace expensive.

I'll come and join you later.

- GPS wrist unit.

For your ROTC orienting weekends
so you know where you are.

We're supposed to learn that
off of maps and stuff.

Oh, come on.

They teaching you how to use
a sextant too?

Modern infantry officers
have, like, a grand worth

of satellite gear
in their packs.

We need to learn how though

in case we get separated
from our unit

or all that fancy equipment

breaks down
in a harsh environment.

Aw, come on.

Just take it.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Well, I sorta have a wife.

He's been gone for a while,

but he's going to be back
in a couple of weeks.

Young or old?

Young.

Ah.

You up for a threesome, hmm?

I mean, an old guy
can dream, can't he?

Laughing Keep dreaming.

Both laughing Come here.

- Who needs more eggs?
- Me, please!

You came in awfully late
for a school night.

Trig test in a couple weeks,
you know.

Wow. Couldn't find
your pants?

I already made them lunches.

What time do you have
to be at work?

Laid off.

Well, that's all right.
I mean, you hated that job.

Didn't hate the money.

Time to get back in bed
when the kids leave?

Oh, I wish.
I can't, I have a meeting.

Bus is leaving!
Dishes in the sink!

Mandy, do you need a ride?

- Sure, if you got room.
- All right.

- Meeting with who?
- Old friend from last night.

Old friend have a name?

Arnando.
We used to work together.

He came to town unexpectedly.

Used to work together
doing what?

Butcher shop.

Debbie, milk in the fridge!

All right, train's leaving!

Mandy!

I'll be back,
just don't make the bed.

Let's go, Jimmy!

Spanish Hurry!

What now?

Now you go away.

What, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

Hey, I'm thirsty.

- You a quitter, Manuel?
- What?

A quitter?
Little baby quitter?

I'll give you $1,000.

You already promised
to give me five.

That or let me cut out
a kidney to sell.

Well, that was
before I realized

that you were
a little pansy quitter.

- Ah!
- Stay away from me, asshole!

Now that is the spirit
that I've been looking for,

but let's channel it
into something constructive,

like getting me on the other
side of the Rio Grande.

How bad do you want
to get back?

It's "badly," but yes, bad!

Come, amigo.

Let me introduce you
to my friend El Cuchillo.

- El Cuchillo.
- Yeah.

- Cuchillo. Cuchillo.
- Let's go.

Your sister doesn't like me.

No, she's just worried
I'm gonna knock you up,

This?
This is a helium-neon laser.

Now I'm gonna perform lasix on
near-sighted neighborhood kids.

50 bucks a pop.

What are you doing this summer?

Probably pretty much
what I did last summer--

drink too much beer,
smoke a lot of weed.

Yeah.

Well, that ain't gonna work.

You got to pad your resume for
your college apps this summer.

You're a poor kid
from the South Side.

And you got a 4.6,
and that's great,

but you're gonna need
a full ride.

What's so goddamn funny?

No, it's just, um...

why does everyone think
I'm going to college?

Dummy,
you are going to college,

and you're gonna graduate.

And then you're gonna
get your masters

and your doctorate.

And then you're gonna make
a boatload of money.

Spend the summer
padding this resume.

Doing what?

I don't give a shit.

Teach brain-damaged kids
how to make plastic explosives

or the blind how to blow glass.

You know what,
I already have my sights set

on a few hundred hours
of community service.

Okay.

That's good.

Get it done.

Courtesy of Cook County
juvenile court system.

You have a 4.6?

My GPA is, like, 1.2.

How smart are you?

- You find anything?
- Nothing I can get with a GED.

Go to Malcolm X.

Take some nurses aide classes
or something.

You got Jimmy playing Mr. Mom,

might as well
take advantage of it.

This Aunt Jemima scarf
too much?

- You gonna be topless?
- Yeah.

No one's gonna be
looking at your head.

How much does
community college cost?

Nothing. Take out of shitload
of student loans,

then bail on the feds
once you get your degree.

Bookkeeping, accounting,

X-ray technician,
dental hygienist.

Yech, I get grossed out
just flossing my teeth.

I've been shoveling sewage
for the last month.

Computer programming.

Drug and alcohol
rehab counselor!

I definitely have the practical
experience for that one.

Crap.

Need a bunch
of psych prerequisites first.

Why don't you take the civil
service exam and get on the ITC?

Drive a bus?

Hey, pension,
health care, paid vacations.

Or there's the Post Office.

Uniforms are for shit.

Everyone looks like they have
a dick in those pants.

Oh, wow, a lot of people
queuing up online for this.

This might just work!

Club's gonna open up
the outdoor patio soon,

maybe Meg would give me
another shot at managing

or at least get
my old job back.

Slinging appletinis?

You didn't need to get your GED

to shake your titties
and collect tips from frat boys.

The money's good,

and it doesn't require
prerequisites.

Requires a couple.

Can you set up the camera,
please?

We're ready to go.

- Who are you supposed to be?
- Thomas Jefferson.

Okay, Miss Sally.

You get your revenge

for me raping you
in the slave quarters.

Sure. How you been?

Thought I'd stop by,

see if you were staffing up
for summer yet.

Patio's not open
till Memorial Day,

but if you want to push
cocktails in 6-inch heels,

I can always use another
pretty girl for the summer.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing

like we discussed last fall.

- Congrats.
- Yeah.

I know I screwed you over
last time.

It's a family thing,
my mother was really--

- I get it.
You have it tough.

But fool me once, shame on you.

- Fool me twice--
- I won't let you down again.

Come on, give me one night
to show you what I can do.

You won't regret it.

Give me a thousand bucks.

I'll find you a night
to promote.

- Promote?
- Yeah.

You take over the club,
do it all.

- How about Tuesday the 15th?
- Next week?

Show me what you got.

I don't have $1,000.

So I'll pencil you in
to work the patio.

Give me a call mid-May,
and keep the weight off.

Speaks portuguese
Hey, pretty girl.

- Mimosa?
- Uh, sure.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family, his friends.

His ability to honor
his commitment,

the value of his word.

Eat, please.

I believe
the only true measure of a man

is his willingness to accept
responsibility for his actions.

Don't you agree?

We're here.

Beautiful, very peaceful.

The Great Lakes, right?

Uh, Lake Michigan.

How many Great Lakes are there?

Uh, five.

I knew the Great Lakes
were big,

but I never imagined
they would be this big.

It's like a sea.

Surprisingly heavy for a man
with so few brains.

Speaking portuguese

So, Steve...

Are you a man capable
of honoring your commitments?

Are you a man of your word?

Men speaking Spanish
Come here, let's go.

Cuchillo! Spanish Another moron.

So...
you are an American, eh?

- Yeah.
- Wanting to go home?

But you have no papers.

No, see,

Say "ah."

Ah.
Ah, ah. Ah.

- Speaking Spanish Good.
- Good?

Whoa! No, amigo,

Jesus!

Okay, okay, fellas,

I'm really kinda getting
skeeved out here.

Uh...

Spanish - Everything okay.
- Clean him. Clean this motherfucker.

- Can I-- can I take them--
- Good luck, Spanish little bitch.

What happened to people
paying you when you do the work?

It was just her way
of telling me to go fuck myself.

What really pissed me off
was how she just assumed

that I couldn't come up
with the money.

Smug bitch.

Well, we did all right today
on that master-slave thing.

I could loan you the money
if you want.

No.
That's okay.

I love you, but...

you gotta save up
for when you have a baby.

- What about Jimmy?
- He's being weird.

Meg's right.
I am a loser.

One more ghetto girl
who thinks she's the shit.

I can't manage a club.

- What's that, self-pity?
- No, reality.

I'll take
the civil service exam,

clean bus shelter trash barrels
for the city.

Hey!
You're Fiona Gallagher.

You can do anything
you set your mind to.

You got your GED.

You've been raising a family of
six since you were 15 years old.

You're a rock star,
and Meg's a frigid bitch.

What's that?

My final paycheck.

Looks like
this battle is almost over.

Ooh!

about swallowing?

She's always been a problem.

It's been a relief to have her

out of the house
these last months.

She was wrecking my marriage.
Pull!

Gunshot, gun cocks

- You lied to me, Steve.
- Yes, well--

but I thought--

You told me you were going
to look after her.

- Yes, well--
- Pull!

I'm sure it's been difficult.
She's a bright girl.

But I spoil her.

I grew up poor, you know.

I want her to have things
I didn't have in the favela--

an education, food...
a toilet.

Pull!
Gunshot

Speaking portuguese

I've arranged for Estefania

to pursue an economics degree

here at the University
of Chicago.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When immigration comes...

you will be her husband.

Pull!

Do you think you can do that
for me, Steve?

Can I trust you?

Absolutely.

But that means
you can't get into any trouble.

No stolen cars, no drugs.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

And the slum girl--
Fiona, yes?

You can fuck her all you want
for fun,

but you're a married man now.

She stays what she is--
a ghetto whore.

Frank is hit!

Preda Raptor.

- Go! Go, go, go!

Oh, and it looks like
Frank is down for the count.

- Get outta the way!
- Get out!

Cheers and applause

We have a new champion.

Crowd chanting "Frank"

Welcome home, Mr. Duncan.

Jack!

Jack!

Just keep walking.

No trouble?

They just waved me
right through.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n in person.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n,
your new nickname.

You're already a legend.
18 balloons.

We've never had
more than eight up one ass.

You have more coke up your anus

than any drug mule
in cartel history.

It's like
taking a shit backwards.

Ex-Lax.
Normally, I would say take two,

but for you,
maybe the whole box.

Engine starts

Engine revs

Pop music, indistinct chatter

Awesome.

Tuesday the 15th.
$1,000. It's all there.

No, I'm sure it is.

But, you know, look.

Promoting a new night
is difficult.

- I should've explained to you--
- I want the club.

You've got a bunch
of kids at home.

- I don't think that you should--
- Do I have the club or not?

Okay.

You're on the calendar.

- Okay, hey, grab two.
- All right.

Hey, beautiful!
Dinner's almost ready!

Oh, Jesus, Jimmy!

You always gotta monitor Carl
when he's online.

Okay.

Sure.
I'm sorry.

What the hell
were you watching?

- History Channel.
- Dinner!

Where were you all day?

I was, you know,
running errands...

this and that.
How was your day?

Remember Meg from the club?

She's gonna give me
my own night to promote.

That's great!

Cheering

- You won?
- Oh, yeah.

Oh, nothing left
but smoke and metal

and bruised geek egos.

Yeah, plus 400 bucks
cash prize for first place.

Thought I could help out
a little bit

with the property tax bill.

Do you want me
to run the payment

down to the post office
before school?

No, I got it.

That's still daddy's spot.
Anything at the hospitals?

I forgot to check today, Debs.
I'll call after dinner, okay?

All right, here we go, guys!

Dinner's served.
Can we make way over here?

Thank you, Billy!

Overlapping chatter

It's like a miniature rover,
pretty much,

with battery power, and then we
put a helium laser on top.

It's like cage fighting,
like octagon--

Talking stops

Whispering Daddy.

Daddy!

Talking resumes

Grunting

Packet hits water Sighs

 Well, I've been fooled

 I fooled around

 no sense to lie

 about where I'm bound

19!

Thank you, Sheila!





You really don't remember
what happened last year?

- School. Now.
- I dropped out.

You'll get your diploma,
I'll get mine.

- What you doing?
- Studying.

You taking your GED?
All right, Fi!

Estefania.
Fiona.

You married
a druglord's daughter?

I'm not in love with her.

That's good, 'cause she
doesn't love you either.

She's got this other guy.
Marco... somebody.

Marco, you're me now.
Take my identity.

And if Este's dad
comes looking for you,

she'll still be married
to Steve Wilton.

We can't have sex anymore.

I'm pretty sure
that Jody's gonna propose.

You're better than this guy,
Karen.

Stay the fuck away from me,

and stay the fuck away
from this baby!

Is it all right
if I stay over tonight?

Couldn't go 12 hours
without seeing me, could you?

Went to the clinic today,
said me having kids...

not likely.

No one said
that we have to stop trying.

Hello, boys.

We got nothing
to be ashamed of.

What fucking world
do you live in?

Officer, oink, oink!

- Does this violate my probation?
- Shut up!

- Laughing
- Screams

- Is it the baby?
- No!

It's you!
Get out!

I really am so sorry
about all of this with Karen.

You deserve better.

Congratulations, my boy.
You hit the jackpot.

- Frank!
- What?

I think you should go.

Why don't you just live
at your real home

with your real family?

I don't like them,
and they don't like me.

Hey, stop that!
Hey, hey!

Please just go.
Leave.

Mind if I sleep here
for the night?

Hey, that's no problem for me.

Back to being a legal resident
around here, Steve?

His name is Jimmy now.

Steve was just an alias he used
to lie to me

about who he really was.

I wanna meet your family.

Sorry to be late.

These are Fiona's brothers,
Carl and Ian.

- Do they know you're gay?
- I'm not gay.

Really?

Screaming
It's coming! It's coming!

Doctor.

What's wrong with him?

- He has down's syndrome, Debs.
- Yeah, and he's Asian.

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

- It's me or the baby.
- The baby, sweetheart.

Know you're gonna regret this.

I love you.

- Are you gonna leave?
- No.

Everybody always leaves.

I won't.

Already done.
Carl.

My man, would you like
some more French toast?

- Uh-huh.
- Lip and Ian?

Already fed and gone.

Why are you eating

Jimmy said it was okay.

I've got your smoothie

Hey.
Can you help me?

Sir.
You need help?

Yes, thank you.

- Where am I?
- Juarez.

- Mexico?
- Speaking Spanish Yes.

- Did I miss Christmas?
- Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

There's an Escalade
parked across the street

with someone in it.

- Oh?
- It's nice.

Still has its hubcaps.

I think it was there
yesterday too.

- Popsicle for breakfast?
- Carl's teeth hurt.

Yeah, 'cause he's eating
popsicles for breakfast.

Did he brush
before he left for school?

Yeah, think so.

Did you check his toothbrush
to see if it was wet?

Mm, I was hoping

that you'd still be in bed

when the kids left for school.

I have to work.

- You've got five minutes.
- Five?

I'll make it ten if I focus

on the white sox box scores
or something.

Liam?

Just plop him down in front
of the wiggles,

he's good for hours.

I can't be late.

I can't be late!

I need the cash
for the property tax bill.

Sniffs

Please don't tell my kids

they can do things
they know they can't.

- Your kids?
- A popsicle?

So I'm just the nanny?

I can feed them, change them,

but when Carl
wants a second popsicle...

A second popsicle?

Didn't like the first one.
Banana.

His teeth are gonna rot
out of his head.

We just spent 2 grand
on his braces.

We?

What?

Not... we.

Me.
I paid for Carl's braces.

No more popsicles
for breakfast, okay?

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had to pick
something up downtown

- before school.
- Downtown?

What they said.

Pick up what?

Go, go, go, go!

When you said you had access
to the building,

I thought you meant
through a door!

I may have fudged
on that a bit.

Hey!

Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

- Get out of the way!
- Stop!

Jesus, whatever happened
to fat, doughnut-eating cops?

Now they're all triathletes.

Catch!

The tall prick looks good
for another 10 miles.

Aah!

Shit!

Ditch out at the street, yeah?

Wait, wait, wait!
Maybe they'll give up.

What are you doing?

Shit, shit!

Whoa!
Whoa.

Right there!
Hold it!

No way West Point takes you
with a felony conviction.

Hey!

Catch you

Screams

Baby fussing

Baby.

Baby.

It's your turn.

I know you're awake.

You're making
that fakey sleep sound.

I was up at 3:00 and 5:00.

Get your ass up,

Fabio motherfucker!

What?

Get your goddamn ass

Excuse me.
Medi-medi-medical emergency.

Good morning.

Passport?

Ah, yeah, um...

No.

Must have left 'em
in my other pants.

But I'm an American citizen.
Chi-town, born and raised.

No passport, no entry.

What?
Since when?

Since Al Qaeda decided
Americans needed killing.

See, here's the thing,

Agent Tacker.

You look like a man

who occasionally enjoys
a malt beverage,

so you can understand,

every once in a while,

a couple of drinks
can get out of hand.

But when it happens,
the next morning,

you have to pick yourself up,
dust yourself off,

and get right back
on the horse.

Am I right, or am I right?

Just let me cross.
I won't tell anyone.

I promise.

You got a driver's license?

Any form of photo ID?
Costco card?

Do I look
like I've got a Costco card?

You look like you need
a course of penicillin

and a lice comb.

Call home,

get somebody to send you
some kind of photo ID,

so we can use it to make you
a temporary passport.

Get cleaned up.

We're not letting you
into the country,

so you can add to Texas'
homeless population.

Next!

Last night, Kev waltzes in,

does his sit-down business
while I'm taking a bath.

Only one bathroom.
Had to go.

We have another bathroom,

but Jimmy can't be bothered
to go downstairs?

Kev once did his poopy business

while I was brushing my teeth.

Only one bathroom.

- Can I steal some of this?
- Sure.

Yesterday,
I caught him vacuuming

and watching Rachel Ray.

Kev doesn't even know
what a vacuum is.

Sure, I do.
Outer space.

Dude in Armageddon got sucked

right out of his space suit,

My topless web traffic

Too many girls ironing.

If we're going to have a kid,
I need to save up money

for when my tits
are the size of watermelons.

There's probably a market
for pervs

who want to see
a woman nursing.

Kev's worried our kid might
find these online one day.

Whoo! Shit on the net
never goes away.

Kev Junior's gonna be surfing
the net for porn one day

and see his mama's
big titties and get hungry.

So we're trying
a new web thing.

Couple act.
Master and slave.

Wah!

You gonna do it in a cast?

Hey, man's gotta eat.

- That is so wrong.
- It's educational.

By acting out a scene
from the old plantation,

we're providing content
for an internet audience

that embraces a truthful
reenactment of our past.

It's racist and wrong!

Which why it's gonna make money

'cause this country is racist.

What's that all about?

The place we were working
yesterday

had a couple billion fleas.

Jimmy doesn't really
do anything.

He just hangs around the house
all day with Liam,

making smoothies, acting
like he's the kids' new dad.

So he's vacuuming, cooking,
and changing dirty diapers,

and you're still pissed.

I thought that's
what you ladies wanted

is shared housework.

Wage equality
and all that Hunger Games,

Lady Gaga girl power shit.

We say it,
but we don't mean it.

There is nothing sexy
about a man with a mop.

TV prelap

I don't know, tell us.

- At least give us a hint.
- Okay.

Hey, my man.

Guitar plays on TV Huh?

I know.
I've seen it worse.

That's right, Chip.
You guessed it.

Living with someone is hard.

When's the last time
you were with a guy

- for longer than a few weeks?
- Pshh. Never.

Wha--

And how long you been living
with Jimmy, three months?

Four.

Boring happens.
We all get bored.

It'll pass.

He'll stop being boring
again soon.

Almost a year, your honor.

Turn a new leaf
or just dumb luck?

No, walking the straight
and narrow, Your Honor.

Thanks to the wise counsel
and guidance

previously provided
by this court.

Are you mocking me, Philip?

No, Your Honor, absolutely not.

You know, I have nothing
but respect for this court

and for the rule of law
that it represents.

You know, the rights
that we've derived

from over 900 years of fealty

to the magna carta
are the only things standing

between us and the anarchy
of mob rule.

Hmm. Still a minor.
What a shame.

The defendant before you beat
a co-worker to death

and a bucket of battery acid.

Hey.

- You knew about this.
- Absolutely not.

I'm shocked and humiliated
by this betrayal.

I can't believe it.

How could she be unfaithful

after everything
we've been through?

Anyway, he's back

You're a hard worker, but...

blood is blood.

When's Junior back?

That's it?

Call you if anything big

We're almost done here.

Now get your wife dressed,

Old friend have a name?

Arnando.
We used to work together.

He came to town unexpectedly.

Used to work together
doing what?

Butcher shop.

Debbie, milk in the fridge!

All right, train's leaving!

Mandy!

I'll be back,
just don't make the bed.

Let's go, Jimmy!

Spanish Hurry!

What now?

Now you go away.

What, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

Hey, I'm thirsty.

- You a quitter, Manuel?
- What?

A quitter?
Little baby quitter?

I'll give you $1,000.

You already promised
to give me five.

That or let me cut out
a kidney to sell.

Well, that was
before I realized

that you were
a little pansy quitter.

- Ah!
- Stay away from me, asshole!

Now that is the spirit
that I've been looking for,

but let's channel it
into something constructive,

like getting me on the other
side of the Rio Grande.

How bad do you want
to get back?

It's "badly," but yes, bad!

Come, amigo.

Let me introduce you
to my friend El Cuchillo.

- El Cuchillo.
- Yeah.

- Cuchillo. Cuchillo.
- Let's go.

The Knife?

Your sister doesn't like me.

No, she's just worried
I'm gonna knock you up,

doesn't want any more
Gallagher mouths to feed.

I'm not my mom.

13 with my brother on her hip.

13, huh?

12 when she got pregnant.

What the hell is that?

This?
This is a helium-neon laser.

Now I'm gonna perform lasix on
near-sighted neighborhood kids.

50 bucks a pop.

What are you doing this summer?

Probably pretty much
what I did last summer--

drink too much beer,
smoke a lot of weed.

Yeah.

Well, that ain't gonna work.

You got to pad your resume for
your college apps this summer.

You're a poor kid
from the South Side.

And you got a 4.6,
and that's great,

but you're gonna need
a full ride.

What's so goddamn funny?

No, it's just, um...

why does everyone think
I'm going to college?

Dummy,
you are going to college,

and you're gonna graduate.

And then you're gonna
get your masters

and your doctorate.

And then you're gonna make
a boatload of money.

Spend the summer
padding this resume.

Doing what?

I don't give a shit.

Teach brain-damaged kids
how to make plastic explosives

or the blind how to blow glass.

You know what,
I already have my sights set

on a few hundred hours
of community service.

Okay.

That's good.

Get it done.

Courtesy of Cook County
juvenile court system.

You have a 4.6?

My GPA is, like, 1.2.

How smart are you?

- You find anything?
- Nothing I can get with a GED.

Go to Malcolm X.

Take some nurses aide classes
or something.

You got Jimmy playing Mr. Mom,

might as well
take advantage of it.

This Aunt Jemima scarf
too much?

- You gonna be topless?
- Yeah.

No one's gonna be
looking at your head.

How much does
community college cost?

Nothing. Take out of shitload
of student loans,

then bail on the feds
once you get your degree.

Bookkeeping, accounting,

X-ray technician,
dental hygienist.

Yech, I get grossed out
just flossing my teeth.

I've been shoveling sewage
for the last month.

Computer programming.

Drug and alcohol
rehab counselor!

I definitely have the practical
experience for that one.

Crap.

Need a bunch
of psych prerequisites first.

Why don't you take the civil
service exam and get on the ITC?

Drive a bus?

Hey, pension,
health care, paid vacations.

Or there's the Post Office.

Uniforms are for shit.

Everyone looks like they have
a dick in those pants.

Oh, wow, a lot of people
queuing up online for this.

This might just work!

Club's gonna open up
the outdoor patio soon,

maybe Meg would give me
another shot at managing

or at least get
my old job back.

Slinging appletinis?

You didn't need to get your GED

to shake your titties
and collect tips from frat boys.

The money's good,

and it doesn't require
prerequisites.

Requires a couple.

Can you set up the camera,
please?

We're ready to go.

- Who are you supposed to be?
- Thomas Jefferson.

Okay, Miss Sally.

You get your revenge

for me raping you
in the slave quarters.

Master.

Ah!

Ooh.

Get down,
you white motherfucker.

Get in there.
Ah!

Yeah, now get that ass.
Munch it, munch it!

Do the alphabet.

We shall overcome,
motherfucker.

Get in there!

We shall overcome!
Screaming

Motor starting

Get on.

Hey, Meg.
How are you?

Fiona...
Gallagher.

Sure. How you been?

Thought I'd stop by,

see if you were staffing up
for summer yet.

Patio's not open
till Memorial Day,

but if you want to push
cocktails in 6-inch heels,

I can always use another
pretty girl for the summer.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing

like we discussed last fall.

- Congrats.
- Yeah.

I know I screwed you over
last time.

It's a family thing,
my mother was really--

- I get it.
You have it tough.

But fool me once, shame on you.

- Fool me twice--
- I won't let you down again.

Come on, give me one night
to show you what I can do.

You won't regret it.

Give me a thousand bucks.

I'll find you a night
to promote.

- Promote?
- Yeah.

You take over the club,
do it all.

- How about Tuesday the 15th?
- Next week?

Show me what you got.

I don't have $1,000.

So I'll pencil you in
to work the patio.

Give me a call mid-May,
and keep the weight off.

Speaks portuguese
Hey, pretty girl.

- Mimosa?
- Uh, sure.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family, his friends.

His ability to honor
his commitment,

the value of his word.

Eat, please.

I believe
the only true measure of a man

is his willingness to accept
responsibility for his actions.

Don't you agree?

We're here.

Beautiful, very peaceful.

The Great Lakes, right?

Uh, Lake Michigan.

How many Great Lakes are there?

Uh, five.

I knew the Great Lakes
were big,

but I never imagined
they would be this big.

It's like a sea.

Surprisingly heavy for a man
with so few brains.

Speaking portuguese

So, Steve...

Are you a man capable
of honoring your commitments?

Are you a man of your word?

Men speaking Spanish
Come here, let's go.

Cuchillo! Spanish Another moron.

So...
you are an American, eh?

- Yeah.
- Wanting to go home?

But you have no papers.

No, see,
we were sort of partying.

Say "ah."

Ah.
Ah, ah. Ah.

- Speaking Spanish Good.
- Good?

Whoa! No, amigo,
I'm not that kind of girl.

Jesus!

Okay, okay, fellas,

I'm really kinda getting
skeeved out here.

Uh...

Spanish - Everything okay.
- Clean him. Clean this motherfucker.

- Can I-- can I take them--
- Good luck, Spanish little bitch.

What happened to people
paying you when you do the work?

It was just her way
of telling me to go fuck myself.

What really pissed me off
was how she just assumed

that I couldn't come up
with the money.

Smug bitch.

Well, we did all right today
on that master-slave thing.

I could loan you the money
if you want.

No.
That's okay.

I love you, but...

you gotta save up
for when you have a baby.

- What about Jimmy?
- He's being weird.

Meg's right.
I am a loser.

One more ghetto girl
who thinks she's the shit.

I can't manage a club.

- What's that, self-pity?
- No, reality.

I'll take
the civil service exam,

clean bus shelter trash barrels
for the city.

Hey!
You're Fiona Gallagher.

You can do anything
you set your mind to.

You got your GED.

You've been raising a family of
six since you were 15 years old.

You're a rock star,
and Meg's a frigid bitch.

What's that?

My final paycheck.

Looks like
this battle is almost over.

Ooh!

The Red Rovertron
is in trouble.

Cheers and applause

Scorpio back for the win.

Back for yet another round of
ritual humiliation, Gallagher?

Finally gonna win this time,
Goff.

College entrants only today,
it was on the website.

Or don't you have internet
down at MLK charter?

What's the matter, Goff?

You afraid a teenager is gonna
kick the shit out of one

of your half-assed bucket
of bolts?

Chortling Your engineering
can't compete

at the black bot championship
trophy level, Gallagher.

Who'd you steal your designs
from this time?

Was it Carnegie Mellon or MIT?

Entry fee is 150,
and we don't take food stamps.

This match, Scorpio Bot
versus... The Impaler.

Let the battle begin.

Ooh!
The Impaler strikes.

Scorpio Bot is down.

The Impaler wins!

Piece of cake.

Upbeat music

?

 gotta be up

 gotta be up and on

 'cause nobody loves you

 when you're wearing a frown

? nobody loves you ?
Chuckling

 when you're wearing a frown

?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

How am I supposed
to swallow that?

Who said anything
about swallowing?

She's always been a problem.

It's been a relief to have her

out of the house
these last months.

She was wrecking my marriage.
Pull!

Gunshot, gun cocks

- You lied to me, Steve.
- Yes, well--

but I thought--

You told me you were going
to look after her.

- Yes, well--
- Pull!

I'm sure it's been difficult.
She's a bright girl.

But I spoil her.

I grew up poor, you know.

I want her to have things
I didn't have in the favela--

an education, food...
a toilet.

Pull!
Gunshot

Speaking portuguese

I've arranged for Estefania

to pursue an economics degree

here at the University
of Chicago.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When immigration comes...

you will be her husband.

Pull!

Do you think you can do that
for me, Steve?

Can I trust you?

Absolutely.

But that means
you can't get into any trouble.

No stolen cars, no drugs.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

And the slum girl--
Fiona, yes?

You can fuck her all you want
for fun,

but you're a married man now.

She stays what she is--
a ghetto whore.

In this corner,
the terror of Northwestern U...

Preda Raptor.

And in this corner,

representing the South Side,

Frank!

Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rum-bot!

Rock music

?

Next.

Thank you.

Let's battle.

Ooh!

Frank is in trouble early.

Fry the fucker, come on.

Ooh!
Audience ohs

- Ooh!
- Get outta there! Get out!

What are you doing?

Frank is hit!

Preda Raptor.

- Go! Go, go, go!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

- Now.
- Frank is on the run.

Oh, and it looks like
Frank is down for the count.

- Get outta the way!
- Get out!

- Go! Go!
- I got it!

Preda Raptor,
coming in for the kill.

Cheers and applause

All: Chanting Preda Raptor,
Preda Raptor,

Preda Raptor, Preda Raptor,
Preda Raptor!

Cheers and applause

He did it!
He... did... it!

We have a new champion.

Crowd chanting "Frank"

Welcome home, Mr. Duncan.

Jack!

Jack!

Just keep walking.

No trouble?

They just waved me
right through.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n in person.

El Gran Ca√±√≥n,
your new nickname.

You're already a legend.
18 balloons.

We've never had
more than eight up one ass.

You have more coke up your anus

than any drug mule
in cartel history.

It's like
taking a shit backwards.

Ex-Lax.
Normally, I would say take two,

but for you,
maybe the whole box.

Engine starts

Engine revs

Pop music, indistinct chatter

Awesome.

Tuesday the 15th.
$1,000. It's all there.

No, I'm sure it is.

But, you know, look.

Promoting a new night
is difficult.

- I should've explained to you--
- I want the club.

You've got a bunch
of kids at home.

- I don't think that you should--
- Do I have the club or not?

Okay.

You're on the calendar.

- Okay, hey, grab two.
- All right.

Hey, beautiful!
Dinner's almost ready!

Oh, Jesus, Jimmy!

You always gotta monitor Carl
when he's online.

Okay.

Sure.
I'm sorry.

What the hell
were you watching?

- History Channel.
- Dinner!

Where were you all day?

I was, you know,
running errands...

this and that.
How was your day?

Remember Meg from the club?

She's gonna give me
my own night to promote.

That's great!

Cheering

- You won?
- Oh, yeah.

Oh, nothing left
but smoke and metal

and bruised geek egos.

Yeah, plus 400 bucks
cash prize for first place.

Thought I could help out
a little bit

with the property tax bill.

Do you want me
to run the payment

down to the post office
before school?

No, I got it.

That's still daddy's spot.
Anything at the hospitals?

I forgot to check today, Debs.
I'll call after dinner, okay?

All right, here we go, guys!

Dinner's served.
Can we make way over here?

Thank you, Billy!

Overlapping chatter

It's like a miniature rover,
pretty much,

with battery power, and then we
put a helium laser on top.

It's like cage fighting,
like octagon--

Talking stops

Whispering Daddy.

Daddy!

Talking resumes

Grunting

Packet hits water Sighs

 Well, I've been fooled

 I fooled around

 no sense to lie

 about where I'm bound

19!

Thank you, Sheila!





This is what you missed
last week on Shameless.

It was great.
It was all about me.

Sort of the hero's journey.

Rock music

- Where am I?
- Juarez.

Did I miss Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

- Morning, Debs.
- 137 days.

He'll be back, Debs.
He always comes back.

Grunting

- Well, hello, Steve.
- Nando.

You know, I was surprised
to see you in the States

'cause I-I thought that the DEA
had you on a watch list.

They do.

So you can imagine how happy
I am to come here.

I've arranged for Estefania
to pursue an economics degree.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When Immigration comes,
you will be her husband.

But that means you can't
get into any trouble.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

Lost my job today.

We gonna have enough
for the property tax bill?

Just, with the check
I got today.

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had
to pick something up

downtown before school.

- Downtown?
- What they said.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing,

like we discussed last fall.

Give me 1,000 bucks, I'll find
you a night to promote.

$1,000.
It's all there.

Okay.
You're on the calendar.

- Oh, my God.
- Hey, can you pass me that--

- Daddy!




High Strung's
The Luck You Got

?

 think of all the luck
you got

it's not for naught

 you were beaming
once before

 what is this feeling

 you're so sure of

 round up the friends
you got

they're not for naught

 you were willing
once before

 what is this feeling

Gasps Shit!

What's the matter?

$1,000.

- Mm, back to sleep.
- I can't breathe.

Maybe it has something to do
with the pillow on your face.

I gotta pay the property tax.

All right, come here,
come here, come here.

Gasping

Moaning

Stop poking me with that thing.

Thought you liked me
poking you with this thing.

What was I thinking?

Sighs exasperatedly

Is this about the club thing?

I woke up having a panic attack

that I was just like Frank
and Monica taking our money,

except I wasn't even
getting high with it.

You know, you're gonna throw
a kick-ass club night.

You gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

Invest in yourself.

Farts

Are you taking a dump
right now?

- Like clockwork, every morning.
- Jesus.

What, I can't take
a dump in here?

Not in front of me you can't.

You were in the shower.

Yeah, and now
I'm out of the shower.

I wouldn't care if you
took a dump in front of me.

Ugh.

Oh! What's going on?

Frank drunk looking for a bed.

Who the hell let him?

- Debbie!
- We begged her not to.

- He's not
hot-bunking my bed.

Why can't he sleep out
on the porch? It's warm enough.

I want my old bed back.

Oh, hell, no!

Come on, daddy.
Up.

Step, step.

Morning, Frank.

This is my house!

It's okay, daddy.
You can sleep in my room.

Wouldn't do it, Debs.

He's especially ripe
this morning.

Frank smells like dog piss.

Not dog piss!

- Gary the homeless guy.
- Come on, daddy.

Sweet dreams, daddy.

Hey, that's my tent.

I'll hose it off
after he wakes up.

Debs, don't let Frank
in here anymore.

This is his home too.

He disappeared for months.

And now he's back.
Excuse.

Rock music

?

Milk money.

Breakfast.

Did you wash up
after you pooped?

What are you, my mom now?

We're supposed to wash up
after we poop?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Not her keeper.

Don't look if you
don't like what you see.

Sweet.

Pants. Now.

Jesus.

Hey, you going to school today?

Oh, no. Later. Gotta skip
my first three periods,

so I can start clocking
community service hours.

And the last 50 bucks
to the property tax, yo.

This should bring us right
around where we need to be.

I didn't put in the money
from that last

- toxic waste gig I had yet.
- Okay, that's cool.

Hand it over,
and I'll drop it off

before I go to community
service, pay the tax man.

I don't have it.

- Don't have what?
- The money.

I used it to put down
a deposit on a club night.

All right.

Debs, Carl, let's go.
School time.

Gotta bring daddy
his breakfast first.

Uh, but the property tax,
that's already two weeks late.

We're always two weeks late.

I'll have the money back
right after the party.

It wasn't yours to spend.

Yeah, it was.
I earned it.

Oh. Oh, that's how
we're doing this now.

Okay, well, I'll take
the money I made last week

and buy an iPad.

Ian, what are you gonna do
with your paycheck, huh?

New leather jacket?
Liam?

I have an opportunity to make
some real money here, Lip.

It's not that easy.

I've been in
the club business a long time.

Yeah, sure you have.
Slinging cocktails, okay?

Look, you don't know shit
about promoting a club party.

Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Lip.

Jazz music

?

 I'm a working man
with a 9:00 to 5:00

Hey, daddy.
Brought you breakfast.

 Gotta be a slave

And the newspaper.

Good to have you home.

Can you help me
with my social studies project?

It's on the Civil War.

Gotta build
Lincoln's log cabin.

- Deb.
- Hmm?

Too much noise.
I need peace and quiet.

I'm trying to sleep.

Seriously?
You're walking me to the curb?

What, did I go back in time
and turn six?

Have a good day at school,
Carl.

Learn something useful.

Muffled, throbbing music

?

 we called it love

 but even the sun sets
in paradise

 I'm at a payphone
trying to call home

Knocks

Sings along ? all
of my change I spent on you ?

 where have
the times gone


 baby it's all wrong

 where are the plans
we made for two


You like?
Maroon 5.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Have you gotten a job yet?

- No.
- Nando told you to get a job.

Listen, I don't know
what it's like in Brazil,

but we're in a recession here.

Oh. Hmm.

I'll keep my eye on you
from now on, okay?

Excuse me?

Make sure
you don't get into trouble.

We are partners now.

Wherever you go, I go.

Snickers
Like a married couple, huh?

Turns up music

 Even the sun sets
in paradise

 I'm at a payphone

Why they got you
doing this, man?

"B" and "E," theft,
and assault.

- Scoffs Nice.
- You?

Hit a kid with a brick.
Kinda broke his face.

Hey, how many hours
you get for that?

50.

Shit, man, I got 120.

Least there's always
someone with some weed.

Car horn honks

Upbeat rock music

Hey, got any weed?

10 bucks a joint.

See, what'd I tell you?

What's up with the geek squad?

Is that
the fucking cast of Glee?

Yeah. Looks like
a bunch of do-gooders.

More like a bunch of
gonna get their ass kicked-ers.

 Back in high school

 when I really liked you

 I was always just a friend

Hey, Meg.

Hey. What's up?

Wanted to get your staff list.

Oh, yeah, sure.
That's a good idea.

Was also wondering if we could
renegotiate my split of the bar.

15% doesn't work for you?

I heard Wendell
gets, like, 30%.

He's my best promoter.

He brings in,
like, a huge crowd.

It's your first gig.
It takes time.

What if she brought
her own booze?

We'll get it from Kev.

Make more money,
it'll work out better.

Gonna have to make it
worth my while.

We could do the same split,

except I keep the 85%
and give you the 15%.

Sighs

Okay.
Bring your own booze.

But I want 20%.

 Tattooed in my mind
just like a memory

 when I looked in your eyes

Fires

 You call me, I call you

 I see you every day
at school

Grunts Yeah.

Come on, GI.

Pound me like an Iraqi soldier.

Okay, you need
to shut the fuck up.

Laughs Oh, I'm sorry.

Still talking.

Hey!
What's going on under there?

- Fuck, fuck.
- Who is it?

Probably a teacher
or some shit.

I told you you were too loud.

Look, I can't get expelled.
My parents will kill me.

Probably hearing about the gay
sex will kill 'em sooner.

Lookee what we got here.

Mickey?

Thought you
were still in juvie.

Not anymore.

Coughing

You having some sort
of queer-bo sex under here?

Gasping No, no, I swear.

Why are you still beating me up?
He was doing it too.

You're the one taking it
in the ass, right?

You're the one
I gotta kick straight.

It working?

- Yes, yes.
- Good.

Get the hell outta here.

You got any fuck left in you,

or you dump it all
in that faggot's ass?

Rock music

?

Hymie crying

Oh, my little chee-chee.

Please don't cry.

Crying

Please don't cry,
my little boy.

Please don't cry.
Crying

Mama's so tired.

Don't you want to give
your wee lungs a--

Aah!

Aah.

Oh, God, that's so loud.

Everything's so loud.

Maybe when we go inside,
Jody can rub your tummy.

And mama,
she can take a little nap.

Sighs

I don't remember Karen causing
such a fuss as you, Hymie.

Maybe it's
from your Chinese side.

Okay.

Cool, you got Hymie
to quiet down?

Hymie!

Rock music

No!

No! No, no, no,
he's not trash!

Whoa! Whoa!

He's not trash!

No, Hymie!

No, no, no!

Hymie crying Oh, Hymie!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Hymie!
Hymie!

Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my-- oh, my--

Hymie.

I'm so sorry!

It's okay, Sheila, he's fine.

No, but he was almost
swallowed up by the truck!

Oh, my-- I'm such
a terrible mother.

No, you're just--
you're just a tired mother.

Sobs
No, no, I--

I don't deserve to live.

- Come on, let's go back inside.
- I'm such a t-- No.

We'll call Debbie
to come baby-sit again,

and we'll get some rest.

- Okay? Come on.
- I'm sorry, baby.

- It's okay.
- No, no, no!

You ever shoot crack?

No.

Ever eat mescaline-laced
mushrooms?

Inhales Nope.

Put a tequila-soaked tampon
up your ass?

What?
No, dude.

I get it. I'm-- I'm obviously
not as cool as you.

Smells good.

Yeah, it's, um, primo stuff.

20 bucks a joint.

Can I buy five?

Yeah, sure thing.

I'm Casper.

- Lip.
- Grizz.

You live around here?

About four blocks over.

Cool.
Coughs

I guess.

Where you from?

Uh, Lakeshore.

I didn't choose it,
I was just born there.

What are you doing
slumming it down here?

Chuckles City Youth.

We're, uh, beautifying Chicago
one block at a time.

Good luck with that.

Those flowers-- they're not
gonna last about two hours.

Just looks good
on my tufts application.

Admissions people are into you
helping out the poor and shit.

Oh, sorry.

It's okay.

I'm not offended.

Hey, uh,

you interested in beautifying

any other parts
of the neighborhood?

Anything to beef up my CV.

Think I may have
something for you.

See if I can work it out.

Dude, hit me up anytime.

I'm on Facebook.
Casper Duncan.

You got it, Casper Duncan.

Man, that was good.

Missed ya.

You did?

Yeah, man.

I had to do
all the fucking in juvie.

Otherwise I'd end up
someone's bitch, right?

Nice to switch back.

Thought you had
four more months.

Yeah, let me out
for overcrowding or some shit.

Coming back to school?

Spits, scoffs

Hell, no, man.
I'd still be a fuckin' freshman.

I haven't passed
a single class.

Why'd you come back, then?

Fronted a bunch of coke
before I went in.

Time to collect.

Oh!

That's good.

So good.

Third call this week
from that same woman, Kev.

- She won't leave a message?
- No.

Probably a fucking
bill collector.

Can you just keep
dodging her, please?

Hi, baby.
How's the foot?

It's goddamn itchy.

What are you two
foxy ladies up to?

Need to bum some liquor off ya.

For her club night.

What, they don't
have booze over there?

She'll make more money
if she brings her own.

All right.
Hobble this way.

Honky-tonk music playing

?

Women chuckling

Okay, how much you need?

More than this.

There's gonna be at least
200 people there, babe.

Have you ever seen
more than 20 deadbeats

in here at one time?

What about
your liquor distributor?

Could I get
the booze from them?

Yeah, maybe.

Walter's a cool enough guy,
for a Roselli.

What? You're dealing with
the mob? You never told me that.

Stan burned
every bridge in town.

Walter's the only
liquor distributor

that'll do business with us.

How much would the booze cost?

For 200 people?
Top shelf? Close to 5 grand.

For well drinks,
you'd probably get away with 3.

Would he let me set up
an account and invoice me later?

Yeah, maybe.
He'll do a credit check, though.

I've got perfect credit.

No credit does not
equal perfect credit.

Do you even have
a social security number?

He'll want you to leave
one of the kids as collateral.

Okay, I get it.

I'll just buy the booze
from him up front, then.

Whose money you gonna use?

Douche bag.

Rock music

?

Uniform sales.

Bus driver.

Short order cook.

- How's it going, Jim-nasium?
- Hey, what's going on?

Can I borrow
some money from you?

Yeah, sure, how much?

$5,000? Pay you back
after my club night?

What?

Yeah, kinda strapped right now.

I got, like, uh,
300 bucks on me.

Are those my jeans, Frank?

Found 'em upstairs in my room.

It's not your room anymore.

You're cutting
her jeans into shorts?

Had three pair of my own,
but somebody tossed my clothes.

These are, like, $120.

I got 'em at Goodwill
for, like, 40 bucks!

Sighs

Can you go to the bank
and get more money?

I don't have any.

What about your parents?

I haven't gotten anything
from them since I was 18.

- Really? College?
- Cars, insurance.

Okay, I haven't gotten any
cash from them since I was 18.

For two years you've been
offering to give me money,

and now when I ask,
you don't have any?

I'm sorry.

This is why I never
ask anybody for help.

- I feel like a jackass now.
- Whoa, hey. Are you mad at me?

Because you get mad at me
when I offer you money,

and now you're getting mad
because I can't?

I'll just figure it out
myself, okay?

- Okay.
- Let's go, V.

Frank, what the hell?

I got that roast chicken
for dinner tonight!

My house, my kitchen,
my fridge, my chicken.

I cut these too short.
My balls are hanging out.

Yeah.

Nice ass.

Scoffs Thought you were
my history teacher Mr. Crouch.

Well, sorry to disappoint.

Hey, how was Community Service?

Yeah, good.

I met some North Side kids.

Think I can make
some dough off 'em.

Cool.

Yeah, gotta do what I can

with my sister stealing a bunch
of our property tax money.

Well, that was cunty of her.

You know, you should be in
charge of your family's money,

not Fiona.

Mr. Gallagher,
just left Mr. Healey's office.

Rumors about you two true?

Said you were supposed
to ask me for a recommendation.

Sure, in his mind,
I was supposed to do that.

A letter of recommendation
from a science teacher

looks good
on your college applications.

Bet it does.

So we got 20 cases of beer,
16 cases of wine,

got two cases of champagne.

I got 10 liters of vodka,
six gin, four rum,

four scotch, four bourbon,
and enough mixers and garnishes

for, like, 200 people.

- Sound about right?
- Yup.

And I can return
whatever I don't use?

Absolutely.

Let me just tally this up here
for you.

What are you doing?

Scoffs Ordering booze.
What's it look like?

I hope the payment
doesn't involve my titties.

Okay, my dear,
I got you in at $4,857,

which includes the 10% discount
'cause you're a friend of Kev's.

And I went ahead
and waived the delivery fee

'cause you're
a first-time customer.

How would you like
to pay for this?

- Check.
- Need a pen?

Yes, please.

Let me go check the schedule,

see what time we'll get this
out to you, okay?

Mm-hmm.

- 'Scuse me.
- Yes.

Is there more than $17
in that account?

By the time the check clears,
I'll have it covered.

The guy is in the mob.

You' cutting him a check
trading on Kev's good name?

Gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

If I don't invest in myself,
no one else ever will.

Knocks

Muffled Come in.

Oh, surprised to see you

at the college counseling
center, Miss Milkovich.

Came to talk to you about Lip.

I'm not at liberty
to discuss another student,

but I'd be more than happy
to help you

with your future options.

Scoffs Please.

You and I both know
my only options

are getting pregnant
or getting arrested,

so cut the crap.

Okay.

Then Lip.

He's got a good chance
of getting out of here.

And what are you
doing about it?

Encouraging him
to go to college.

Doesn't seem to be
too interested.

You're a guidance counselor.
Fucking guide him.

There's only so much I can do.

- What should he be doing?
- Keeping his grades up.

Getting teacher
recommendations,

finding himself
a legitimate job,

filling out
his college applications.

Now, you think you can help
with any of that?

Maybe.

All right, stop by
at the end of the day,

I'll post
some college brochures,

you could take 'em with you.

I think you have
a better chance

of getting through to him
than I did, Lysistrata.

What?

Show up for English
once in a while,

and you'll get the reference.

All right.

Let's go, buddy.

All right.

Yeah.

Daddy.

No, I'm not black enough or
drunk enough to be your daddy.

Whoa!

- Mommy.
- Yeah.

Mommy.

You seriously gonna keep
following me everywhere I go?

It's my job.

Don't you ever have
to go to the bathroom?

Okay.
Dialing phone

Okay, Liam.
There you go.

Hey, Este, it's me.

Hi.
Panting

Why are you breathing so hard?

Gym.

You never know with you.

So Beto is sitting out front.

He follows me wherever I go.

Your father told him
to keep an eye on me?

- Don't worry. He's harmless.
- Who?

Your father or Beto?

Because neither of them
seemed harmless

when they were dicing up Marco.

Beer.
I need beer.

Panting

Just a second, Frank.

Stay out of trouble,
and you'll be fine.

All right, listen.
I gotta go.

I gotta run some errands,
make some money for Fiona.

Look, my dad is a hothead.

Blows off steam,
threatens lives,

and then cools down,
forgets why he was mad.

He is gemini.

He will call Beto off soon.

Okay.

Rock music

?

Gracias.

Hey, uh, 'scuse me.

What happened to all the meth
heads squatting in here?

Who the hell are you?

Concerned neighborhood citizen.

Took me six months
to get rid of 'em.

Yeah, I heard there were
dead bodies in there too.

Yeah. Four, yeah.
Coyotes got to 'em at one point.

Gonna take me eight weeks
to make it livable again.

How much you paying these guys?

Too much.

Might have
a better deal for you.

Gunshots, explosion

- How's the pasta?
- Good.

You're like our maid now.

Thanks, Carl.

Gunshots on TV

Car engine revs

Hey, Debs,
watch Liam for a bit.

- I gotta run an errand.
- No can do.

- Baby-sitting for Sheila.
- Carl.

Can I stay up late
and watch TV?

Absolutely.

Rock music

?

I'm going to Sheila's tonight,
daddy.

Baby-sitting.

A noble job, Debs.

That stupid baby's
still crying?

Won't stop.

Hey, that's my toothbrush.

And thanks
for sharing it with me, son.

- Oh, man, eew!
- Now that we're a family again,

I want to encourage us to be
all for one and one for all.

Ew, gonna have to boil it now.

You need the number
over at Sheila's?

Where I'll be.

No, why would I?

I'll be heading out
to the Alibi soon.

Oh, and don't worry about me
walking home late at night.

I have a pillowcase
full of bars of soap.

Good for you.

You get along a lot better

with a weapon and a kind word
than a kind word alone.

Any of that spaghetti left?

Gunshots on TV

Oh, darn it.

Sizzles

Ew.

Sighs

Drill whirring

What are you doing?

Keeping Frank out.

Planning to go
to Carnegie Mellon?

Please.

That's for nerds and homos.

But, um, Healey
thinks Lip should apply.

Fat chance.

He's smart enough.

Yeah, but too stupid
to do anything about it.

I already tried.

Hey, can I ask you a question?

Sure.

How do you know if a guy

you've been hanging out with
likes you?

You like him?

Uh-huh,
but I think he hates me.

Ask him.

Doesn't want to talk about it.

No guy ever does.

How do I know, then?

Does he get that look
in his eye when he's with you?

What look?

You'll know when you see it.

Hymie crying

Did you know that Abe Lincoln
lived in a one-room log cabin

when he was born, Hymie,

and that his grandfather was
ambushed and killed by indians?

Some historians say that
because he was cold to women,

he might've had
homosexual tendencies.

Debbie? Deb?

The whole point
of you baby-sitting Hymie

was to keep him quiet, so Jody
and I could get some sleep.

Sorry, Sheila, he won't stop.

Hymie crying

Why don't you take him
for a walk?

- Where?
- I don't care.

Just anywhere.

Just don't come back
for a few hours.

Okay?

Cell phone rings

Hey, what's up?

Hey, where are you?

I am...

Clicks running an errand.

Where are you?

Uh, at V's, changing.

I'm gonna run by the club,
talk to this promoter.

See if we can
get his email list

to invite more people
to my party.

Good idea.

You mind watching the kids?

Got it covered.

- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Okay, okay, okay, I'm out.
I'm out, I'm out.

Oh.

Why you steal Porsche?

I needed money
to help my girlfriend.

You have a car at home.
Sell that.

How am I
supposed to get around?

Nando will kill us both
if you get into trouble.

Okay, I promise
not to do it again, okay?

You betray me.

What are you doing?

Cracks Ow!

Fuck me!

Holy shit!

Clean break, I think.

Don't screw with me again.

Fine. Okay.

- Come on.
- Ow.

I take you to the hospital,

then we go get
American Whoppers, huh?

Car chirps

 You've got it

 the way
you grinding up on me

 I know, I know you want me

?

 the way
you kissing up on me

 I know, I know you need me

?

Hey, Meg, is Wendell around?

Uh, yeah, right over there.

 The way
you grinding up on me

Thanks.

I'll tell you this.

For all of their laziness
and lack of motivation,

Mexicans are a lovely people.

Why'd you go down there, Frank?

Hey, I'll take another, Kev.

Sometimes a man
just has to get away,

be alone with his thoughts.

Hey!

Jesus.

So what, you woke up
from a drunken stupor,

didn't know where you were?

I knew exactly where I was.

Had a business opportunity

with our south-of-the-border
brothers.

- What did you do to your foot?
- It fell off.

Was the only prosthetic
I could afford.

What kind
of business opportunity?

I was hired to move
some inventory.

Drug mule?

Only the best
the mexicanos have ever seen.

Not something you really want
to be bragging about, Frank.

- Which end did it go in?
- Yo, Frank.

Some chick's outside
with a baby looking for you.

Oh, no.

- Who is it, Frank?
- I-I-I don't know.

But does that sound like
good news to you?

I'm gonna slip out the back.

Sounds like you were

slipping it out the back
in Mexico, Frank.

Laughter

Baby crying

Shh.

Daddy.

Wait, you're the chick
with the baby?

Kev won't let me in
after 6:00 PM anymore.

What the hell's wrong
with Liam?

- This isn't Liam, it's Hymie.
- Well, jeez.

Shut him up.

Sheila has an oriental baby?

I have to finish
my Civil War project...

- Jesus.
- ...and he won't stop crying.

You were always
so good with Liam.

Give-- give him--
give him to me.

Open his mouth.

- What is that?
- Valium.

Are you supposed
to give Valium to a baby?

Oh, yeah.
It always worked with you.

Oh.
Hymie's crying subsides

Voila.

Thanks, daddy.

Hey, loan me 20 bucks, will ya?

Sighs

I only have five.

That'll do it.

Clattering I hate you!

Glass shatters

 Come, come, baby, yeah

 come, come, baby, yeah

 push my button,
make me wanna play

Chuckles

Your friend likes to dance.

The tequila likes to dance.

Yeah.

So you think
you're gonna be able

to pull this off
tomorrow night?

Hope so.

I bet you will.

Looks like you have
some real talent.

You're not talking about my
club promoting skills, are you?

What makes you say that?

Your hand on my knee.

I meant to put it
up your skirt.

Oh.

What are the chances of me

getting ahold
of your email lists?

Why would I give them to you?

Mm, satisfaction of knowing
you're helping a good person.

No, I can't come inside that.

I could give you
a cut of my bar, then.

10%?

You know how long it took me
to build up my list?

You honestly think I'd risk it
on you throwing some lame party

and ruining my brand
for anything less than 50%?

Well,
that's an interesting offer.

Let me discuss it
with my partner.

 Come, come, baby, yeah,
come, come, baby, yeah

He wants 50% of the bar
for his email list,

and he's a giant douche bag.

No worries.

I swiped his phone
from his jacket

as soon as I saw
his hand on your knee.

Has all his contacts.

Gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

- Aah!
- Aah!

- Debbie?
- Nighty-night, Hymie.

Whispers Oh, my goodness.

How did you do it, Debbie?

Whispers
Daddy's good with babies.

Frank?

Sighs

You just getting home?

Oh, hey.
Still awake?

Where have you been?

Uh, Emergency Room.
Slammed it in the door.

- Yeah.
- Well, you're in trouble.

You let Carl stay up late
on a school night.

Oh.

I think you need a spanking.

Hmm?

I can't do it
with your pants on, though.

Then I should take them off.

Very bad boy.

I've been a bad, bad boy.

Bad.

This Purdue place looks cool.

I want mommy to show me
how bad I've been.

There's no way she's gonna

make the money back
for the property tax.

Says they're one of the top

engineering schools
in the country.

I'm gonna have
to figure out a way

to make up the 1,000 bucks
she's gonna lose.

Giggling You listening to me?

Yeah, you know,
it's kind of hard

with the, uh, porno going
on across the hall.

Is it wrong that
it's kind of turning me on?

Yeah, me too.

Giggling

Muffled speech

- Morning.
- Hey.

Jimmy gonna come down
to make us breakfast?

He's sleeping in.
Eat your cereal.

- Wore him out, huh?
- You too. Eat your cereal.

Spoiled now.
Need an omelet.

So, um, how's the club night
thing coming?

Gonna be a big success.

Probably make enough money
to roll it into another one.

Take out a small loan,
really get things going.

What's wrong, Debs?

Sighs Got home late.

Baby-sitting.

So the ghetto girl

thinks she can live
the American dream, huh?

Maybe it's my time, Lip.

Chuckles
None of your business, Mandy.

Don't you see,
it doesn't work like that, sis.

When you're poor,
only way to make money

is to steal it or scam it,

like Don King or Joe Kennedy.

Daddy's home!

- Brought friends.
- Howdy!

- Just dump it.
- Hey, that's my bike!

Doesn't really work anymore.

Yeah, because you
bent the rim, Frank.

And where's the seat?

That's why it hurt so much
when I rode it.

Come on, fellas.

Get some brekkie,
soak up the alcohol.

- Do you have sourdough?
- Hey, this is our food!

Don't be rude.

Is this about money, Fiona?

Because I am happy
to pay my share.

That's all you ever want
from me anymore anyway.

There.
You happy, huh?

That's about $300 worth.

Come on, lads!

Let's go upstairs,
take a disco nap

till the Alibi's open again.

Dad, no, no.

- Lip, don't.
- This is my home.

You have no right
to kick me out of it.

I am an important part
of this family.

No, you're not.

You don't live here anymore.

Fine.

If that's the way
you want it, I'll leave.

Phil, Chester, I'm sorry.

My family
doesn't want me here anymore.

Charge!

Overlapping chatter

Jackass!

That's it.
Let's go! Go!

Stop it, guys!
Stop!

Just pick a bed, fellas!
Just pick a bed. Oh, my God!

What the hell are you doing?

Shouting

Get the fuck outta here!

Come.
You are not sleeping here.

- No, stop!
- Come on.

Get up, get up!

Overlapping chatter
He's not doing anything!

You are not going to--

- Go!
- What's the matter with you?

Gasps

Well, that's
a piece of shit anyway.

Sighs

Frank!

Debs...

Damn it, Frank,
get the fuck out!

No, you cannot do this to her!

- Come on! Get up right now!
- Jesus! What's the--

- Get out!
- Get out!

Jesus!

Stop!

I treated you well!
And you--

- Ow!
- How could you do this to me?

Stop! Stop--

Get out of my house!
I hate you!

- I don't even care!
- Jesus!

Get out! Get out!

Dad.

- Get him out.
- Ow, God!

- Debs!
- Debs!

Muffled crying

Get out!

I hate you! Get--

don't you touch me!

Panting

Sobs Oh, my God.

Get out!

After everything
I have done for you,

this is the thanks I get.

- Where should we put him?
- Where he belongs.

- Open it up, Carl!
- Got it.

Whatever, you--

Jesus Christ!

Not funny!
Not funny at all!

Gonna need you to clean
the blood splatter on the walls,

evidence marks on the floor,
and patch up the bullet holes.

That should get you started.

- Supplies are inside.
- Shit.

You okay, buddy?

Been trying all morning
to get tickets

to the Wilco concert
at Soldier Field tonight.

- Can't get through.
- Wilco?

Aren't they for, like, dads with
receding hairlines and shit?

Come on, Wilco is the beacon
of anti-commercialism.

Yeah, because no one
wants to buy their whiny music,

they gotta give it away
for free.

Shit.

All right, here you go.
It's 50 bucks a head.

That's $400.

Hey, hey, um,

is there any chance I can get an
advance on the next couple days?

Hey, slow your roll, kid.

I haven't seen
what they could do yet.

- Se√±or.
- Yeah?

This man stole our jobs?

No, no, I didn't steal them,
I just underbid you.

But we are illegal immigrants.
How can you underbid us?

Ghetto white's the new brown.

- The what?
- The new brown.

This is unfair.

Just living
the American dream, amigo!

Okay, let's keep eight cases
of that beer up front,

and put the rest
in the back refrigerator.

Hello.

People showing up already?

 Turn it up, turn it off now

- ? turn it up... ?
- Can I help you?

Alderman Edward Gretsky,
15th Ward.

Okay.

Throwing a party, I see.

Something like that.

Just a friendly visit.

You know, make sure you filled
out all your applications.

Applications?

Business license, liquor
license, umbrella insurance.

Well, I'm sure Meg handled
everything that you need.

She did.
For her business.

What?

Well, you're running
the show now, right?

Well, just for tonight.

Then just for tonight

I'll make an exception
on the applications for...

small filing fee.

- A filing fee?
- Let's say $1,000.

Wouldn't want
any pesky policemen or firemen

showing up now, would we?

?

I'll come back later
to collect.

Let's say 2:00 AM.

?

How is the pinky?

It's doing okay.

So listen, my girlfriend's
having a party tonight.

It's important that I go.

Is there going to be
alcohol there?

It's a party, it's kind of
how these things work, yeah.

- Drugs?
- Maybe.

- Bad things may happen.
- Yeah, or not.

I go with you.
Just to make sure.

Yeah, see, that's the thing
is that you can't go with me

because then I'll have
to explain who you are,

how I know you,
that my life's in danger.

I mean, that won't
go over very well.

Then you stay home.

Rock music

?

Hey, Sanchez.

- Aw, hell.
- Time to pay up.

- They let you out?
- Good behavior.

I thought I had
four more months.

Think again.

Hey, yo,
campus security is coming.

The hell are you doing?

Didn't want you to get busted.

I can look after myself,
thank you.

Does he get that look
in his eye-- look in his eye--

look in his eye
when he's with you?

Just got outta juvie, remember?

- The fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

You look great.

Thanks, Debs.

You okay with what happened
this morning? Frank?

Jimmy's in the bathroom puking.

Sighs

Vomiting

Knocks What's going on?

Something I ate.
It's not sitting well.

Vomits You need anything?

Vomiting loudly

No, I'm just bummed
I can't make it tonight.

I mean, I really wanted to go.
Flushes toilet

If you feel better later,
come on over, okay?

Okay.

Knocks
Go away. We're not buying.

Banging

Jeez.

I know, I know,
you want me to find Jesus.

I already found him, thanks.

I'm looking for Kev.

Kevin Ball.

I'm his wife.

 I ask myself why
but I don't know

 fairy tales...

Tommy!

Hey, you still got that garage?

Yeah, it kinda
comes with the house, Frank.

Great. What's say
you let me sleep there?

What's say I don't.

- Why the hell not?
- Because the last time

you stayed at my place,
you shit in my kitchen sink.

The layout of your home
is very confusing.

No, Frank.

No means no.

Fuck you, Tommy.

Fuck you means fuck you.

Kermit!

My best friend.

You can't stay with me, Frank.

Wh-- what if
I suck your dick?

Frank.

What if you immigrate
to Mexico, Frank?

Reverse the prevailing tide.

Why are you even here?

Should be
collecting disability.

'Cause I didn't
injure my foot at work.

Hey, let me crash
at your place.

I'll tell the insurance company
that you did.

Why can't you stay
at your place, Frank?

Ungrateful little shits!
That's why.

Things I do for them.

Blood, sweat, and tears.

This is not how a family
treats each other. Phone ringing

Yeah.

Hang on.
It's for you. V.

Hey, baby, what's going on?

What?

No, yeah, okay.

Okay, I'll be right there.

Watch the bar.

Little redheaded bitch
is the worst of 'em.

Expect it from the others,
but not from--

not from--
from...

her--
Debbie.

Orphan Annie turned on me.

That's how I got
all these bruises.

She hit me.
With a bat.

Now, I can't touch her.
No.

That is child abuse.
I'd get reported.

Yes, hello.

Gallagher.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.

Not-- n-not that they
don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, viol-- What?

No, if it's all right, I would
like to remain anonymous.

No, thank you.

And God bless you.

That is an all-time low.

Even for you, Frank.

?

 charge amex, see

 like you got an "A,"
score credit

 living that American dream

 you could be a celebrity

 when you step on the scene

 I know you gotta look hot

 you and your girls
with dresses

 until they cut
your power out

 shopping like a rich girl

 shopping like a rich girl

Hey, V, where are you?

This place is insane!
We did it!

 like a rich girl

 credit card, max it out

Muffled club music

?

Hey, is this the club

where Wilco's gonna play
a secret concert?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, uh,

20 bucks, self-parked.
30 valet.

- I'll park it myself.
- Cool.

Uh, just pull over
right down there.

That lovely lady
will show you to your spot.

- Thank you.
- Cool. Have fun.

- Yo.
- Hey, Lip.

How you doing, man?

Good. Got your text about
the impromptu Wilco concert.

Tweeted everyone I know.

Thought you might.

Hey, hop out.
I'll have someone park your car.

- Thanks.
- Cool.

Surf rock music

?

How long we doing this for?

Figure we park
about 30 more cars,

make enough money to cover
the property tax,

at which time people
will probably start to realize

Wilco's not playing
at Fiona's club.

Then we bolt.

Out.

Where am I supposed to go?

Hymie crying

Just-- just shake him.
Hymie crying

You're not supposed
to shake a baby.

I know, but maybe it'll
make him stop crying.

Yeah, because his brains
will get scrambled.

- They already are!
- Sheila!

I'm just saying maybe it'll

scramble 'em
back together again.

Howdy, folks.

You need help with that baby?

- Frank?
- How'd you get in my house?

I still have a key.

I-I-I got a proposition
for you, Sheila.

- What? No!
- Frank, you have to leave.

No, let me stay,
and I'll be your wet nurse.

I don't mean your wet nurse,
that involves breast-feeding,

but your nurse,
your baby nurse.

Room and board, you'll get
eight hours of sleep a night.

I can promise you that.

Debbie did say
he was good with babies.

There, you see?
My reputation precedes me.

Just give me five minutes.

Aw, hell.
Give me 30 seconds.

If I can't put
this little tyke to sleep,

I'll-- I'll leave, pronto.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hymie crying

Yeah, yeah.
Oh, oh.

I got you.

Raised eight kids myself.

I know what I'm doing.
Chuckles

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Here you go.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Hymie quiets Yeah.

Ah.

H-how--

how did you do that, Frank?

I think I'll take
a shower before bed.

75, 76, 78.

Okay. Just over 10 grand.

That's not bad.

So, 15% for you.

I thought we agreed on 20.

Right.

$2,000.

Thank you.

Take mine anytime you're ready.

Look forward to doing business
with you in the future.

This is to cover my booze.

And that leaves me
with 2 grand.

Didn't forget
about us, did you?

Of course not.

Thanks, Fiona.

 Do you want my love, boy

- ? do you want my love ?
- Five, six, seven, eight...

$900?

That's all I have left?

That's not bad
for your first gig.

But that doesn't even
cover my deposit.

I lost $100 doing this night.

Surprised you didn't lose more.

It took me, like, eight gigs
before I saw a profit.

You gotta pay your dues.

?

 do you want my love

Distant police sirens wail

Hey.

What's going on?

Can I sleep here tonight?

Sure.

How'd you do?

It's gonna take a while
till I start making money.

Here.
Almost all of it.

I'll get the rest, I promise.

- Ah, keep it.
- What?

Well, if you're gonna gamble
our money,

you should hold onto it, right?

Scoffs I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

Oh, congratulations.

You risked everything,
and you didn't even break even.

It was my first time
doing this.

That's not the point.

You made a decision without
consulting the rest of us.

- I'm in charge of this family.
- Really?

No, I'm sorry, that's--
that's news to me.

You see, Fiona, if we're gonna
be every man for himself,

this family
is going under fast.

Here,
just take the money, okay?

Pay the property tax. I'll get
the rest tomorrow somehow.

No, I don't need it.

What?

I took care
of the situation myself.

How?

Told a bunch of North Side kids

that Wilco was playing
at your party.

It's like I said.

The only way to make money
when you're poor

is to steal it or scam it.

But hey, um, let me know if
the rules are changing, right,

and you're gonna pull
this shit again?

Maybe I'll have to take
over the family money, huh?

Rock music

?

Are we sure about this?

He raised six great kids.

Look at him.

He's like the baby whisperer.

?





For all of you
who were too fucking busy,

this is what happened
last week on Shameless...

What the fuck you looking at?

This is my home.

I am an important part
of this family. Jesus!

No, you're not.
You don't live here anymore.

Catch. Open it.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Well, I sort of have a wife.

- She's always been a problem.
- No!

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When Immigration comes,
you will be her husband.

Beto's out front.
He follows me wherever I go.

He's harmless.

Ow! Fuck!

Daddy's good with babies.

Howdy, folks.
You need help with that baby?

I got a proposition
for you, Sheils.

Let me stay. You'll get
eight hours of sleep a night.

I can promise you that.

I know what I'm doing.

Are you supposed
to give Valium to a baby?

I lost $100 doing this night.

I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

The only way to make money
when you're poor

is to steal it or scam it.

I know. I know.
You want me to find Jesus.

I already found him.
Thanks.

I'm looking for Kev.

I'm his wife.

Upbeat music



Hey.

Hey.

You're awake.

Never fell asleep.

Sighs Just go talk to him.

It's not his fault
the crazy ex-wife

showed up out of nowhere.

She's no his ex,
she's his wife.

And you should've seen his face
when he saw her.

This house is so quiet.

Kids! Breakfast!

Jeez, Fiona.

This shit
is all in your head, V.

This house ain't quiet.

And she is not Kev's wife.
You are.

Go talk to him.

Baby crying

Groans

I need coffee.

We're out of filters.

We can use paper towels.

We're out of paper towels.

Diapers will work.

You have to go to work.

Yeah. Can we just reschedule
the doctor thing?

No, the vaccine schedule
is very important.

You can't be late.

How busy can a tattoo parlor be
in the morning?

Morning to us.

To some people, it's the end
of a long night.

Good morning.

No breakfast?

I haven't had a lot of energy
for shopping lately.

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

The Hymster and I will go
on a little field trip

to the grocery store.

We just need some cash,
right, buddy?

You still drunk, Frank?

Baby crying

Fine.

Oh, damn.
I got to go.

I'll grab coffee
on the way to work.

Boo-da-loo-boop.

Baby crying

Crying stops

I'm awake!

Baby crying Oh.

Go catch some Zs, Sheils.

- I got the little guy.
- I can't.

Hymie has his first
"Well Baby" appointment today

at the pediatrician.

Doctor require
some kind of co-pay

for this unnecessary visit?

Oh, of course he does.

Doctors are thieves,
little Hymster.

They just have degrees
to keep them out of jail.

Go on.
I'll take him.

Gasps You will?

- Yeah.
- Frank!

Oh, Frank, bless you.
Bless you.

Baby crying Bless you.

Oh. Okay.

- Here. Here.
- Okay.

- Here you go.
- That'll do it.

Ooh, look at that.

Oh, wait.
Don't you need the address?

- Where is she?
- She's still sleeping.

She did not just show up here
because her car broke down.

What do you think, V,
she broke it on purpose?

I think she broke you
on purpose.

She broke you.

And I put you back together.

And now she's here
to take back what I fixed.

V, look.
Look at this.

Divorce papers--
I got them off the internet.

This is my chance
to get her to sign it,

to make it official.

Why didn't you just say that
last night?

Because you were yelling
some shit about my face,

and then you ditched
and slept over at Fiona's.

Well, I was right
about your face.

Yawns

Good morning.

Hey.

I made you some coffee--

super strong, like you like it.

Yay, Kevy-caf, my fave.

"Kevy-caf"?

Decaf, full-caf, Kevy-caf--

for when you need
a real kick in the ass.

- Can I watch some TV?
- Yeah.

Gags

It's how she likes it.

Mmm.

Your bed is so comfy.
I slept like a baby.

You slept in our bed?

I stayed in the guest room.

Sighs God.

I haven't smelled that smell
in so long.

What smell?

His cologne...
on the pillow.

English Leather, like...

- Old man Carlyle used to wear.
- Old man Carlyle used to wear.

Giggles

"Old man Carlyle"?

Foster home where we met.

He was the best fake dad
we ever head.

You know
Junior's going to prison?

- Tax evasion.
- Junior Carlyle, no shit?

- No shit.
- No shit?

Six frozen OJs
for the price of five.

20% off mac and cheese,

and I have four of these.

Only one coupon per customer.

- It doesn't say that.
- It doesn't have to.

- It's implied.
- Hey, Tina.

It's time for your break.

Why don't you have Kim
take over your station?

Oh, my God.

- Is that snot?
- Sorry--

kids, summer colds.

I have four
mac and cheese coupons--

- I told you, one per customer.
- Hey, watch your tone.

I'll watch my tone
when you teach your kids

- how to use a kleenex.
- Excuse me?

I have four coupons!

I dug through
the neighbor's trash

- to get them!
- Tina, break time!

- Let's go.
- You know what? Fine!

Take it. Take all of it!
Take it for free!

I don't give a shit!

Do you hear me, Bobby?

I don't give a shit!

Take your own goddamn break!

And you can keep
my last paycheck.

I won't be coming back.

Keep taking this shit
if you want to.

But I'm out, bitches.
Out!

Why don't we just talk here
for a second, Tina.

Okay.

Maybe I shouldn't have pushed
so hard on the coupon thing.

Just, uh, stay here
and bag the groceries.

We didn't pay.

She said we could have 'em.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Are you the manager?

Uh, yes.
I'm so sorry

you had to hear
that kind of language

with your children present,
ma'am.

If you'd, uh, follow me back
to my office,

I'd be happy to give you
a coupon for a free ham.

That'd be great.

But it seems like
she kind of quit back there,

so I was thinking there
might be a job opening.

Hmm.
What's your name?

Fiona Gallagher.

You know what?

Why don't you follow me,
Fiona Gallagher?

So, right place,
right time, huh?

Hope so.

I'm responsible
and a really hard worker.

- You ever work as a cashier?
- Sure, absolutely.

So, tell me, Fiona,

how do you feel
about deli meats?

Deli meats?

I'm not big on olive loaf--

barfed it up once
when I was a kid.

- But mostly I like 'em.
- Good.

That's good.

I ask, because if you're gonna
be working here,

I got to see
how you handle the meat.

We sell franks and beans too.

We sell hot dogs, corn dogs,

three bean salad, cream cheese.

Chuckles Wow.

You're saying that if blow you,

I can have a job?

No.
I would never say that.

That would be inappropriate
and illegal.

If you wanted to blow me,

well, you'd have to be
a consenting adult.

Good morning, Frank.
Who's your handsome friend?

Chuckles
You hear that, Hymie?

That's Kate.
Kate's got good taste.

Give me a shot of JB,
a pickled egg,

and a thumbtack.

A thumbtack?

And a band-aid.

Baby crying

Trilling lips

There you go and--

mumps be gone.
Baby crying

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yeah, it's all over,
little buddy.

There you go.
There you go.

I'm gonna need
another one of these.

Um, I think I'm--
yeah.

I'm calling the police
and reporting child abuse.

Trills lips

AIDS didn't come
from the homos, Kate.

The gays may have helped
to spread it,

with their bloody
anal passions,

but it originated in vaccines

made from the blood
of African monkeys.

Interestingly enough,
heterosexual monkeys.

It was homos, Frank.
Chuckles

He needs his shots, Frank.

Jesus Christ, Kate.

The kid's already a half-wit.

You want to give him
autism too?

Now close your mouth

before someone considers it
an invitation,

and pour me a goddamn drink.

The stars came out

for the Wishing Lane Foundation
last night.

Adam Foster, ten years old,
and living

with a rare form leukemia,
had only one wish--

to meet his heroes, The Bulls.

They did better than that,
giving him courtside seats

and a ball
signed by the entire team.

Holy shit.
The whole team?

What do you think
that'd go for on eBay?

Couple grand, at least.

That kid's just got cancer.

Hymie's mentally deficient.

That's a permanent condition.

You should know, Frank.
Laughs

Trills lips

That would be an awesome job!

Discounts on groceries--

that could really help
with summer day care costs.

I'm not getting that job.

It's not gonna happen, so let's
just drop it, okay, Debs?

Debs?

Are you kidding me?

Get out of here,
you piece of shit!

You better run,
you sick bastard!

Hard rock music



You okay, Debs?

You shouldn't have to see that.

Can you describe the perp?

Red--
really, really red.

- What, like, sunburned?
- She's talking about his--

The guy, Debs.

What did the guy look like--
his face?

How are you supposed
to see his face

behind that giant,
red, one-eyed--

Got it. Okay.

You did great, miss.
Thank you.

Yeah, okay, come on, Debs.

Let's go get you a Bomb Pop
or something, huh?

- Why didn't you stab him?
- Stab him with what?

You ride the city bus
without a knife?

Scoffs

He was about 30, tallish,

long hair, long beard,
small dick...

you know, 'cause guys
with big ones

don't feel the need
to jerk it at little girls.

Okay.

- Uh, I'll file a report, but...
- But what?

Nobody cares
about a pervert on a bus?

We'll let the ITC know.

They'll keep an eye out
for the guy.

Thanks.

You did the right thing,
calling.

Here's my direct line,

if you need anything else.

Door opens, closes

- What?
- "You did the right thing.

- Here's my direct line."
- Please.

You have less
to worry about from him

than from the manager
at the grocery store.

Am I supposed to find comfort
in that sentence?

Dude wanted a blow
in exchange for a job,

giving new meaning
to "blow job."

Wow?

You grow up in this house,

you think that nothing
can shock you anymore.

And then--

what is it with men
and their johnsons--

shaking them on buses,

using them to blackmail
potential employees?

You know, that was probably
a good job too--

benefits,
discounts on groceries.

Sighs

You know what?

He doesn't get away
with this shit.

- I'm going back over there.
- Great.

You want me to come with you?

No, but can you watch Liam?

Oh, shit.
Sorry, I can't.

You just offered
to come with me.

No, I know,
because I knew you'd say no.

I got a checkup.

Sighs

Kick ass, take names.

Don't blow anyone.

You let her sleep in our bed?

You said yourself
she's a crazy bitch.

She is a crazy bitch.

And not a crazy bitch
like you're a crazy bitch,

like, "oh, bitch,
you so crazy." No!

She once tried to beat me
to death with a frozen fish

because I had asked
if there was more broccoli.

And you never know
what's gonna set her off.

What are you doing?
Put that back on.

I'm changing.
Cell phone rings

Teresa will be here
at 2:00.

- Who's that?
- Notary public,

gets her hair done
at mom's salon.

So you have until 2:00 to get
the divorce papers signed,

or I'll show her
who's a crazy bitch.

- Hey.
- Put your shirt on.

Put your shirt on!

Hey, I'm changing.

I'm gonna go take a look
at your car.

- Okay.
- On that foot?

I can handle it.

If you can handle it,
maybe you can handle

the dripping faucet
in our bathroom.

- How'd you do that anyway?
- Shootin' hoop.

I snapped my achilles
posting up some local kid--

he's huge. He's probably gonna
go in the NBA draft next year.

He snapped it
falling in the bathtub

like an old Florida Jew.

Laughs
Which was right after the game.

It was a delayed reaction.

Hey, V, you still have
that mini camera

you use for titty shots?

I need your help with a scumbag
at the grocery store.

- Hey, I'm--
- I know who you are.

Chuckles V, why don't you
go help Fiona at the store?

And while you're there,
see if there's

some more broccoli.

Fine. Come on.

Teresa, here, 2:00.

Holy shit.

A lot of red dots.

All those red dots
are sex offenders

in our neighborhood?

All right, check this out.

Child rapist three blocks over,

did five years
and out on probation.

How does a child rapist
only get five years?

He doesn't--
he gets five years,

plus the beating of this life.
Let's go.

I thought
we were gonna fix the pool.

No, no, no,
you should come, Carl.

- Grab the bat.
- Awesome.

Hey, you want help?

My dad always loves
a good perv posse.

So we're just forgetting
about the guy on the bus?

Hell, no, I'm gonna
teach you self-defense--

Milkovich style.
Come on.

All right, let's go.

Yo, we're going
to jump a pedophile.

- You want to come?
- Aw, sounds great.

But I can't.

You're acting cagey, okay?

And there's been
an Escalade parked

across the street
for longer than makes sense.

What's going on?

I don't want to know?

'Cause if you told me,
I'd have to tell Fiona,

which would upset
the delicate peace

we've recently established?

Right.

Have fun
wailing on the pedophile.

Is there any way not to?

Thank you.

No, thank you, Marta.
Thank you.

- Now you stay strong.
- Come on, baby.

Hello.
May I help you?

I hope so.
I'm Frank Gallagher.

May I start by saying thank you

for all you do
for our suffering little ones.

Thank you, Mr. Gallagher.

This is my son Hymie.

He was born
with an extra chromosome,

through no fault of his own--
Down Syndrome.

It's a lifelong condition.
It's irreversible.

He's a beautiful boy.

Aren't you, Hymie?
Yes, you are.

And believe it or not,
he is already,

at such a young age,
an avid sports fan.

Is that so?

He can watch a ball dribble

up and down a court for hours,

endlessly fascinated.

His little face
just lights up with joy.

It would be so wonderful

if he could see it
all happen in real life.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher.

I-I think
you may be confused.

Our organization
works with dying children,

not children with Down's.

Of course.

Of course.
I know that.

Crying

It's my other child
that's dying.

Sobs Oh, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Blows nose, sobs

Drive.

Chuckles

What the fuck you want?

Convicted child rapist

just moved in down the street.

Let's get the boys.

Rock music



What the fuck
is this little parade?

Kid fucker, next block.

Knock at door

May I help you?

We're looking
for Blake Collins.

Sighs I am Blake Collins.

Oh, shit.

You're the eighth-grade teacher
who screwed her student, right?

You were on TV.

I didn't "screw" William.
I loved him.

And I did my time.
I paid for my mistake--

if love can be called
a mistake.

Sighs I'm sure
there are real criminals

in the the neighborhood
that you can beat up

if you have the inclination.

Now, please,
may I close the door?

Yeah, yeah.

Door closes

Shit.

Let's go find a camel jockey.

Yo, Carl, get home, all right?

Shit, we should still
do something.

You thinking gang bang?

Uh, no,
but she fucks little kids.

It was one kid,
and he wasn't that little.

Look, he was 14.
She was his teacher.

Do we really want a pedophile
living in the neighborhood?

Shit, if it was 14
and had a teacher

who looked like that
and wanted it?

Man, I'm getting wood
just thinking about that.

Yo, Angie?

Yeah?

You want to fuck?

Sure.

Now, see, I thought
you two were, uh...

Shut up.

Hope you're using a raincoat.

You were having sex at 14.

I was having sex
with a 14-year-old at 14.

So you think Kash
should have gone to jail?

Yeah, I do.

I almost called
the cops 100 times.

Should've--
creepy fucking Arab dude

- fucking my little brother.
- I was 15.

I was old enough
to make my own decisions.

You were a kid.
He was a man.

Says you.

You really want this chick
living in the neighborhood?

Think about Carl.

- Carl should be so lucky.
- Okay.

So what if it was Debbie
and a 30-year-old dude?

- Ugh, it's different.
- Bullshit it's different.

Look, she's not hanging around
the park with lollipops.

She fell in love.

It's got nothing to do
with love.

This chick
is a standard-issue pedophile,

and I'm gonna prove it.

Shouting in portuguese _

- Sorry I'm late.
- I hate this INS bullshit.

America is supposed to be
free country, no?

No.

Hey!
That's a nice outfit.

It's not an outfit.
It's a perv trap.

What, is that like
a bear trap--

where your titties
clamp around the wrist

and they have to gnaw off
their own paws?

Both laugh
2:00.

I got it.

She hates me, doesn't she?

No. She just
don't know you yet.

I mean, I get it-- I would hate
me, too, if I were her.

I mean, I show up here
with my kid in tow,

and you haven't seen me
in years.

It's almost like I'm trying
to get you back or something.

But honestly, Kev, I don't even
know if Kyle's yours.

I was really getting around
back then.

So V has nothing
to worry about.

What?
What'd I say?

You think Kyle could be mine?

You didn't do that math?

Shit. Sorry.

Cancer?

How did I get cancer?

You must have caught it
from grammy, son.

If she had known that she had
the contagious kind,

I don't think she would've spent
so much time

with you in the basement,
cooking meth.

Am I going to die?

I hope not.

But right now we have to fight

and fight hard.

You ready to fight
with me, Carl?

Razor whirring

Why do we have to shave it?

Didn't you ever see any shows
about cancer?

Cancer people are always bald.

Grammy wasn't bald.

Grammy hated life.

She wanted to die,
but you love life.

And one
of the most important ways

you can fight the cancer

is to let the sunrays
in through your skull.

Why are you shaving
Carl's head?

Lice.

Since when do you...

parent?

Since you dropped the ball.

The vermin were literally
jumping off his scalp.

Well, make sure
you wash the sheets too, okay?

I look like a woman?

I have lice too?

Yes.
Yes, you do.

Fiona's gonna freak out.

No, Fiona is not
going to freak out,

because Fiona
is not going to know.

You're a man now, Carl.

The cancer makes you a man.

And as a man, it's your job

to keep secrets
from the women who love you.

Jeez, I'm gonna
look like a penis.

Razor stops whirring

I'll get you a hat.

I'll get you a hat.
Razor whirring

Knock at door

- Yes?
- Hi. Uh, how you doing?

I'm-- I'm Lip,
uh, short for Phillip.

I-I just live right over
on 64th.

I'm gonna be a sophomore
next year at Lincoln.

Um, I was walking by your yard,

and it looks pretty overgrown.

I was wondering, um...

can I trim your hedges?

Like, five bucks an hour?

Scoffs
May I trim your hedges?

Oh, right, yeah, sorry.

Um, may I trim your hedges?

Upbeat music



Yeah.

Yeah, it's good.
It's good.

- We're good.
- No!

No, we're just taking fake
wedding pictures for the INS.

No one's gonna see you
in that dress.

The INS will see me!

And if I look like cow,
they will know it fake!

And I will get deported for sure!

And you will go to prison.
Speaking portuguese _

- She's your wife.
- No.

You married her before God, no?

No, I married her
before her father,

who had a gun
pointed at my nuts.

It's different, somehow.

Buy something.

89 cents.

I-I don't get it.

Take the cup out of the trash.

Oh, the stuff's in it!

Just get out.

You need whatever
brain cells you got left.

Why you got to mess
with my business, man?

Why you got to do
your business in my store?

It's not your store.
It's towelhead's store.

- Whatever--
get smarter customers,

'cause I'm not going down
for this shit.

Oh, okay.

So, uh, what you
going down for, then, huh?

Hey, did you really fuck
Angie Zahgo today?

Yeah, I fucked Angie.
Everybody fucks Angie.

You don't fuck Angie?

No.

Huh.
You want to fuck Angie?

I can call her,
get her down here.

No.

Hey.

Grunts Ow!

- Who are you?
- Kyle.

What's your business here?

I may or may not be related
to your neighbor Kevin.

Oh.

Okay. Sorry.

I'm Debbie Gallagher.

Any idea where
I can get a smoke?

 in the garden of Eden

 Adam-- he said to Eve

 "girl, get away
from that tree

 or the lord might punish me

 that's just
what I have to believe"

Finished already?

Yeah, not quite.
Um, I'm just--

I'm really hot.

Um, could I bother you
for something to drink?

A juice box?

Yes, please.

Uh...

just wait here.

 you know it ain't no chore

 when you're working,
working for the Lord

Hi.

Uh, I-I told you
to wait out there.

Yeah, so sorry.
I just, um--

I wondered if I could bother you
for a sandwich too?

You know, I ain't had lunch.

You haven't had lunch.

"Ain't" isn't a word, Phillip.

Right.

Hey, um, are you a teacher?

Scoffs
I-I used to be.

Oh, I bet you were a good one.

Inhales deeply, stammers
What kind of sandwich?

PB and J?

With the crust cut off?

Yes, please.

And you should've heard her
going on and on

about Kev's cologne and
Old man Johnson, or some shit--

anything she could talk about
that I wouldn't know about.

He's right in there.
You know what you're doing?

Do I know how to make a man
ask me for a hummer?

Wait here.

Sighs

Mm, he was born March 2001.

Weren't we together?

No, remember?
We split up that year.

Got back together after 9/11.

Why did we break up, again?

Oh, yeah.

You tried to run me over
with your car.

Giggles

Yeah, I don't remember
that being funny.

It was fucking scary.

Well, as it turns out,
it was the pregnancy hormones.

You were knocked up.

So he is mine?

I don't know, Kev.
Sighs

We were off and on that year.
There were other guys.

When you left me,

I didn't think
I could raise him on my own.

So I gave him
to my sister Crystal,

'cause she always wanted a kid.

Now she's going through
some shit,

needed me to take him.

And we thought it was time
you knew the truth.

You thought it was time?

You didn't think
it might have been time

at any other point
in the 12 years

- this kid's been alive?
- I'm really sorry, Kev.

You're sorry?
12 years, Cheryl.

You left me!

If there was a chance
that he could've been mine,

you should've told me
about him.

And did I tell you she called
her coffee "Kevy-caf"?

Like a pet name, like they have

some secret language
that I don't speak.

- V, what happened?
- Oh.

Corn dogs, cream cheese,
I got it all on tape.

- He's nasty.
- Right?

Go.
He's waitin' on you.

I want day shifts,
home by 6:00.

Couldn't help but notice
your wedding ring, Bobby.

You want your wife
to see this tape?

Fine. Days.

Just fill this out.

And we'll be taking
some veal cutlets

for our troubles--

actual veal cutlets,

none of your skanky deli meats.

Upbeat music



Go, go, go, go, go.

Speaking portuguese _

Gasps

That is terrible ugly dress.

Your friend, she must not
like you very much.

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

Mmm.

Um, you have a little, uh...

Oh.
Clears throat

Mm.
Chuckles

Oh, no, uh, the other--
the other--

Mm.

Did I get it?

No.

You know, um, can you help me?

How old are you really,
Phillip?

16...

almost.

Sighs

But I've always felt
like an old soul.

Mm.

Oh! Ah.
You-- you mustn't tell anyone.

No, no.
I won't. I won't.

I-I promise you,
just--

you're such a good teacher,
I feel like

I-I got so much
to learn from you.

Have-- you have so much
to learn.

- I do.
- You do. Oh.

Mm, I got to go.

- Go?
- Yeah, homework.

- In the summer?
- Mm.

- Oh, shit.
- Don't go, Phillip.

- I have more to teach you.
- Uh-huh.

- Come with me, Phillip.
- I, uh--

Shh. Don't worry.
Don't be scared, okay?

I'll teach you.

Grunts

Are you coming, Phillip?

Uh, yeah--
yes, I'm coming.

Phone beeping
Bring the peanut butter!

Rock music



Nice place you got here.

What are you doing here?

I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips

and a ginger snap, I'm hoping.

Keep the change.

I'm working.

Well, maybe later.

Happy hour at The Fountain?

Yeah, okay.

Okay.

You got a receipt?

Receipt printing

That your grandpa?

Nah, just a guy
I've been seeing.

Oh, that's the guy
you've been, uh--

you've been seeing?

You guys, like,
picnic together, or, uh...

you gonna get a little dog
with a fucking sweater?

Nah, we don't picnic.
We mostly just fuck...

like you and Angie.

That image--

it's, like, scorched
behind my eyes--

a fire-breathing
one-eyed dragon.

You don't have to smoke,
you know.

It's cooler if you don't.

- Really?
- Everyone smokes.

You're only a rebel
if you don't.

Have you ever seen one
in real life...

like, on a grown-up,
when it's...

like that?

Yeah, I watch lots of porn.

It's way different in real life

than those sketches they show
you in health class, right?

What's Kev like?

Is he cool, or is he batshit
like everyone else in my family?

No, Kev's cool, nice...

like you.

I think I may become a nun.

Nuns don't have sex, right?

You're pretty--

too pretty to be a nun.

Hey, T!
What's up, girl?

You look skinny.

Don't come down here
sweet-talking me, V.

I've been sitting here waiting
for almost an hour.

What?
Kev never showed up?

No. Nobody's here
to sign anything.

And nobody's here
to pay me my money.

And I sure as shit
didn't cart my ass

all the way down here for free.

Hey, you, kid!

Where's your mother?

She and Kev
went to go get a drink.

He was freaking out
about the whole kid thing.

What whole kid thing?

About how I may be Kev's kid.

Debs, be home for dinner.

- I will.
- V?

Veronica, where's my $40?

Here, here, I got it.

Here you go.

Hi.

Am I-- am I gonna get
as sick as them?

Coughs

Only time will tell.

The good news is,
the cancer's in your brain.

And you never were
much of a thinker,

so it probably
won't affect you that much.

Oh, God.
Oh, God!

Wait, wait.

You need to learn to wait,
Phillip, okay?

- No, why-- why--
- Just hold it back.

- I'll get hard again quick,
I-I promise.

No, it gets better
if you delay the gratification.

The joy-- it's even bigger.
Just wait, okay?

Okay, that's--
wow.

That's really fucking good.

What is that?
What is that?

That tingles.
What is that--

some kind
of sex cream or something?

Giggles It's, uh...

it's-- oh, God.

- I don't think I can wait.
- No, no, no.

You can do it, Phillip.

You are my A-plus student.

- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, breathe deeper.

- Mm.
- Slowly.

- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Slowly.

Slow.

Okay?

- Okay.
- Good.

What's, uh--
what-- what's that?

That's, um--
ah, that's weird.

Giggles
Yeah, that's--

that's cold.
What-- what is that?

Well, you trimmed my hedges,

and now I am trimming yours.

Wait, what--
what is that, fucking nair?

You're fresh and clean now,

- just like a baby, Phillip.
- Wait, no, what--

oh, shit.

You said you catered
to dying children.

Sir, The Bulls only give us
so many packages per season

- and it takes months.
- Ow!

What the fuck, Frank?

That's going on
all day, every day.

My son is suffering.

Have you no soul?

If you fill out
an application now,

I can almost guarantee
that for next year--

He doesn't have a year!

Whimpers

There's a camp.

All the spots are full,
but there's a quadriplegic.

He won't get much out of it.

I can bump him for Carl.

Camp?

Like summer camp?

It's beautiful,
on a lake--

a wonderful place
for children to feel normal

one last time.

What the hell am I supposed to
do with a trip to cancer camp?

I've never been to camp.

Baby crying

Jimmy, come sit with me.
I want to show you something.

Come!

Hey.

All of this
romantic pretending, amor,

it make me so hot...

and wet.

Ow.

- Feel.
- Ow.

We should not put
all that water to waste, no?

- No?
- No.

- Ow.
- No.

Este, Este, listen.

- I-I--
- Yes?

- I-I can't.
- Yes.

- I-I--
- Yes!

- I can't.
- Yes!

No.
I can't!

Moans

- I-- no, I can't.
- Yes!

- Oh, fuck!
- Yes! Moans

Indistinct conversation

All right,
what are we gonna do?

- Whose ass am I kicking first?
- There's no ass to kick.

Kev's a little boy with
a "white picket fence" fantasy,

and in walks his wife
with his son.

We don't know that's his kid.

So first thing we do
is get a paternity test.

It's not about blood to Kev.

There's a woman
he grew up with and married

saying her son is his.

- That's stupid.
- It's not. Look at you.

You're a mother to your kids.

Doesn't matter
you didn't push them out.

Kev's the first good man
I've ever loved, you know?

My first love was
named Apollo, enough said.

Then there was Spider.

Laughs Spider?

You can't make that shit up.

No, I...

I can't fight for Kev.

Asking him to pick me over them

is asking him to change
the thing about him

that I love the most.

Screw that.

- Fi...
- No.

- Screw that.
- Fiona.

Sit-- Fi!

- Good catch.
- Kev!

- What the fuck?
- There's kids around.

Oh, you think
they haven't heard it before?

- What, are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

I'm out of my mind,
'cause you and V

are the only things
that have ever made sense

to me in this
whole fucked up world.

Okay, if you guys
can't make it,

Jimmy and I should
just quit right now.

I swear to God,
if you leave V--

- Who's leaving V?
- You're leaving V?

No.
Fiona, what the hell?

The notary, Kev,
the divorce papers?

Oh!

Shit. I had some drinks.

And Cheryl
dropped this kid bomb, and--

- and I forgot.
- Hey!

- You're interrupting.
- Excuse me?

Kev's trying
to get to know his son.

Give my boys their time.

- Your boys?
- No, no, Fiona.

It's not--
it's not what you think.

Look, Cheryl and I
have history-- that's it.

And she's not trying
to steal me away from V.

She just wants me
to meet my son.

I know school
was never your thing,

but you've never been dumb.

If you don't see
what happening here,

just plain dumb.

Come on, Debs, dinnertime.

- Can Kyle come?
- No.

All right.

You know, my mother,

she reminds me very much
of your Fiona--

beautiful, raised six kids,
never complained, a saint.

My father, he was a...

Speaking portuguese _

- A rolling stone.
- She put my hand there.

I didn't even move it.

That is something exactly
like my father would have said.

Did that fatty
actually cop a feel?

He totally copped a feel.

Laughs
You got to be kidding me.

I mean, what's up with that?

Shit, Mickey.
What the hell you doing here?

Ah, from the store, right?

Oh, come on, Ian,
don't be rude.

Invite your boyfriend
back to my place.

I mean, the more
the merrier, right?

Chuckles I'm sorry.

- What'd you call me?
- What?

Oh, Jesus, Mickey!

Faggot.

What the fuck
did you call me, faggot?

Enough. Enough!

Horn honking

- What the fuck, Gallagher?
- Shit, Mickey.

They're gonna call the cops.

- Are you okay?
- Come on!

- Sorry.
- Gallagher!

Sorry.
I'll text you.

Ah, shit!

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

Laughs

Both laughing

Where'd you learn this?

Nowhere.
Just relax and enjoy.

You been watching porn
without me?

'Cause, you know,
I consider that cheating.

No, I haven't,

although I do consider
that rule pretty unrealistic.

I just thought it up.

It's hot, right?

Maybe if I was licking it
off you.

I'm hungry.
Trade places.

- No.
- No?

Chuckles Since when
do you turn down a BJ?

Your dick's not even hard.

What?
I did a little manscaping.

Shit.

It's not my fault, okay?

What-- she's a pedophile!

Look, it was a sting operation.

Look, I took a picture
for the cops.

Fuck the cops.
They had their chance.

Shit.

Sighs

- Smells good.
- What's with Mandy?

Ah, something she wanted to do.

- Where's Jimmy?
- No idea.

What happened
to your head, Carl?

- Lice.
- Again?

Yeah, Frank shaved it.

Yeah, and he got me
into a summer camp.

What?
Why would he do that?

I don't know.
But it's cool, right?

Yeah, it's awesome, Carl.

Sighs

Door closes

I'm gonna know my kid.

I'm gonna know my kid,

and you can't have
a problem with that.

Look, I...

I don't care about Cheryl, V.

I used to, but she's nothing
but a memory to me now.

And I'm sorry...

Sighs
I didn't go see the notary.

But I would
never leave you, ever.

You got to know that.

After everything
we've been through,

you kind of just have
to know that.

Sobs

Whoa. You just snotted
the whole table.

Laughter

Kev?

Kev.

Laughter

What?
What the fuck?

Are they laughing at me?

- No.
- Yes.

- Fiona!
- Fuck you!

- Excuse you?
- Cheryl, listen--

No, I'm done listening.
Kyle, go pack our shit, now.

Cheryl, would you just
listen to me?

You could've had this,
and you want that?

She's some kind of nympho,

has three drawers
full of dildos.

What you doing going through
my shit, bitch?

What's a dildo?

Cheryl, would you just listen?

You're just as thick
as the day I met you.

Cheryl, I get that you're mad,

but I want to be
a father to Kyle.

Now, I'm gonna get you
a place nearby.

He's not yours, Kev.
He isn't even mine.

He's my sister's,
you stupid piece of shit!

What did she say?

What did she say?

- What the fuck, bitch?
- Get her, V!

I'll fuck you up!

Screams

Well, should we
stop 'em, or--?

What, you want to lose an eye?

- Aah!
- You're a crazy bitch!

- Kill her, V!
- Aah!

Bitch, you come into my house

and make up
some shit like that?

Get your hands off me,
you dirty bitch!

Screams Get her off me!

- Shit, the TV!
- No!

Not the TV!

Get the divorce papers, Kev.

- This bitch is about to sign.
- I ain't signing shit!

This way, this way.
Screams

If you want to walk away
with four limbs, bitch,

you're gonna sign.
Kev, the papers!

- Fuck you!
- You're signing!

Snap Aah!

- Sign the papers.
- Aah!

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Screams

Sign it!

You could initial that.

Grunts, panting

Uh-uh, not one word.
Just drive away.

Tires squeal

Whoo.

Bitch, you so crazy.

Hell, yeah!

All cheering

Hell, yeah!

You're still here.

You think I'm getting in a car
with that psycho?

Hey, uh,
can I borrow your phone?

I need to call my mom--
my other mom.

Sure.

You want to eat dinner first?

- Sure.
- Cool.

Knock at door

- You Blake?
- Shakily Yes.

You're moving now, Blake.

- You're moving tonight.
- Excuse me?

I don't excuse you,
you sick bitch.

I don't excuse you
'cause you're hot

or 'cause you're blonde
or 'cause

of what you've got
between your legs.

Come take a look.

You see that?

They're digging your grave.

And you want to be gone before
they get down to six feet.

- How's it going, boys?
- Good.

We dug the Berlanti grave
in what, two hours?

But this dirt
is nice and soft--

- going a lot faster.
- Ticktock.

Kid fucker.

Sighs deeply

- Hey.
- Hey.

You looked stressed.

I do?

- How was your day?
- Good.

How'd it go at the doctor?

Good.
It's healing.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Crying

The world's messed up.

So much ugly shit happens.

I don't know.
Kev and V and--

I trust you.

That's bigger to me
than "I love you."

It's a bigger deal.

I trust you.

This is what you missed
last week on Shameless.

It was great.
It was all about me.

Sort of the hero's journey.

Rock music

- Where am I?
- Juarez.

Did I miss Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

- Morning, Debs.
- 137 days.

He'll be back, Debs.
He always comes back.

Grunting

- Well, hello, Steve.
- Nando.

You know, I was surprised
to see you in the States

'cause I-I thought that the DEA
had you on a watch list.

They do.

So you can imagine how happy
I am to come here.

I've arranged for Estefania
to pursue an economics degree.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When Immigration comes,
you will be her husband.

But that means you can't
get into any trouble.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

Lost my job today.

We gonna have enough
for the property tax bill?

Just, with the check
I got today.

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had
to pick something up

downtown before school.

- Downtown?
- What they said.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing,

like we discussed last fall.

Give me 1,000 bucks, I'll find
you a night to promote.

$1,000.
It's all there.

Okay.
You're on the calendar.

- Oh, my God.
- Hey, can you pass me that--

- Daddy!

Gasps Shit!

What's the matter?

$1,000.

- Mm, back to sleep.
- I can't breathe.

Maybe it has something to do
with the pillow on your face.

I gotta pay the property tax.

All right, come here,
come here, come here.

Gasping

Moaning

Stop poking me with that thing.

Thought you liked me
poking you with this thing.

What was I thinking?

Sighs exasperatedly

Is this about the club thing?

I woke up having a panic attack

that I was just like Frank
and Monica taking our money,

except I wasn't even
getting high with it.

You know, you're gonna throw
a kick-ass club night.

You gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

Invest in yourself.

Farts

Are you taking a dump
right now?

- Like clockwork, every morning.
- Jesus.

What, I can't take
a dump in here?

Not in front of me you can't.

You were in the shower.

Yeah, and now
I'm out of the shower.

I wouldn't care if you
took a dump in front of me.

Ugh.

Oh! What's going on?

Frank drunk looking for a bed.

Who the hell let him?

- Debbie!
- We begged her not to.

- He's not
hot-bunking my bed.

Why can't he sleep out
on the porch? It's warm enough.

I want my old bed back.

Oh, hell, no!

Come on, daddy.
Up.

Step, step.

Morning, Frank.

This is my house!

It's okay, daddy.
You can sleep in my room.

Wouldn't do it, Debs.

He's especially ripe
this morning.

Frank smells like dog piss.

Not dog piss!

- Gary the homeless guy.
- Come on, daddy.

Sweet dreams, daddy.

Hey, that's my tent.

I'll hose it off
after he wakes up.

Debs, don't let Frank
in here anymore.

This is his home too.

He disappeared for months.

And now he's back.
Excuse.

Rock music

?

Milk money.

Breakfast.

Did you wash up
after you pooped?

What are you, my mom now?

We're supposed to wash up
after we poop?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Not her keeper.

Don't look if you
don't like what you see.

Sweet.

Pants. Now.

Jesus.

Hey, you going to school today?

Oh, no. Later. Gotta skip
my first three periods,

so I can start clocking
community service hours.

And the last 50 bucks
to the property tax, yo.

This should bring us right
around where we need to be.

I didn't put in the money
from that last

- toxic waste gig I had yet.
- Okay, that's cool.

Hand it over,
and I'll drop it off

before I go to community
service, pay the tax man.

I don't have it.

- Don't have what?
- The money.

I used it to put down
a deposit on a club night.

All right.

Debs, Carl, let's go.
School time.

Gotta bring daddy
his breakfast first.

Uh, but the property tax,
that's already two weeks late.

We're always two weeks late.

I'll have the money back
right after the party.

It wasn't yours to spend.

Yeah, it was.
I earned it.

Oh. Oh, that's how
we're doing this now.

Okay, well, I'll take
the money I made last week

and buy an iPad.

Ian, what are you gonna do
with your paycheck, huh?

New leather jacket?
Liam?

I have an opportunity to make
some real money here, Lip.

It's not that easy.

I've been in
the club business a long time.

Yeah, sure you have.
Slinging cocktails, okay?

Look, you don't know shit
about promoting a club party.

Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Lip.

Jazz music

?

 I'm a working man
with a 9:00 to 5:00

Hey, daddy.
Brought you breakfast.

 Gotta be a slave

And the newspaper.

Good to have you home.

Can you help me
with my social studies project?

It's on the Civil War.

Gotta build
Lincoln's log cabin.

- Deb.
- Hmm?

Too much noise.
I need peace and quiet.

I'm trying to sleep.

Seriously?
You're walking me to the curb?

What, did I go back in time
and turn six?

Have a good day at school,
Carl.

Learn something useful.

Muffled, throbbing music

?

 we called it love

 but even the sun sets
in paradise

 I'm at a payphone
trying to call home

Knocks

Sings along ? all
of my change I spent on you ?

 where have
the times gone


 baby it's all wrong

 where are the plans
we made for two


You like?
Maroon 5.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Have you gotten a job yet?

- No.
- Nando told you to get a job.

Listen, I don't know
what it's like in Brazil,

but we're in a recession here.

Oh. Hmm.

I'll keep my eye on you
from now on, okay?

Excuse me?

Make sure
you don't get into trouble.

We are partners now.

Wherever you go, I go.

Snickers
Like a married couple, huh?

Turns up music

 Even the sun sets
in paradise

 I'm at a payphone

Why they got you
doing this, man?

"B" and "E," theft,
and assault.

- Scoffs Nice.
- You?

Hit a kid with a brick.
Kinda broke his face.

Hey, how many hours
you get for that?

50.

Shit, man, I got 120.

Least there's always
someone with some weed.

Car horn honks

Upbeat rock music

Hey, got any weed?

10 bucks a joint.

See, what'd I tell you?

What's up with the geek squad?

Is that
the fucking cast of Glee?

Yeah. Looks like
a bunch of do-gooders.

More like a bunch of
gonna get their ass kicked-ers.

 Back in high school

 when I really liked you

 I was always just a friend

Hey, Meg.

Hey. What's up?

Wanted to get your staff list.

Oh, yeah, sure.
That's a good idea.

Was also wondering if we could
renegotiate my split of the bar.

15% doesn't work for you?

I heard Wendell
gets, like, 30%.

He's my best promoter.

He brings in,
like, a huge crowd.

It's your first gig.
It takes time.

What if she brought
her own booze?

We'll get it from Kev.

Make more money,
it'll work out better.

Gonna have to make it
worth my while.

We could do the same split,

except I keep the 85%
and give you the 15%.

Sighs

Okay.
Bring your own booze.

But I want 20%.

 Tattooed in my mind
just like a memory

 when I looked in your eyes

Fires

 You call me, I call you

 I see you every day
at school

Grunts Yeah.

Come on, GI.

Pound me like an Iraqi soldier.

Okay, you need
to shut the fuck up.

Laughs Oh, I'm sorry.

Still talking.

Hey!
What's going on under there?

- Fuck, fuck.
- Who is it?

Probably a teacher
or some shit.

I told you you were too loud.

Look, I can't get expelled.
My parents will kill me.

Probably hearing about the gay
sex will kill 'em sooner.

Lookee what we got here.

Mickey?

Thought you
were still in juvie.

Not anymore.

Coughing

You having some sort
of queer-bo sex under here?

Gasping No, no, I swear.

Why are you still beating me up?
He was doing it too.

You're the one taking it
in the ass, right?

You're the one
I gotta kick straight.

It working?

- Yes, yes.
- Good.

Get the hell outta here.

You got any fuck left in you,

or you dump it all
in that faggot's ass?

Rock music

?

Hymie crying

Oh, my little chee-chee.

Please don't cry.

Crying

Please don't cry,
my little boy.

Please don't cry.
Crying

Mama's so tired.

Don't you want to give
your wee lungs a--

Aah!

Aah.

Oh, God, that's so loud.

Everything's so loud.

Maybe when we go inside,
Jody can rub your tummy.

And mama,
she can take a little nap.

Sighs

I don't remember Karen causing
such a fuss as you, Hymie.

Maybe it's
from your Chinese side.

Okay.

Cool, you got Hymie
to quiet down?

Hymie!

Rock music

No!

No! No, no, no,
he's not trash!

Whoa! Whoa!

He's not trash!

No, Hymie!

No, no, no!

Hymie crying Oh, Hymie!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Hymie!
Hymie!

Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my-- oh, my--

Hymie.

I'm so sorry!

It's okay, Sheila, he's fine.

No, but he was almost
swallowed up by the truck!

Oh, my-- I'm such
a terrible mother.

No, you're just--
you're just a tired mother.

Sobs
No, no, I--

I don't deserve to live.

- Come on, let's go back inside.
- I'm such a t-- No.

We'll call Debbie
to come baby-sit again,

and we'll get some rest.

- Okay? Come on.
- I'm sorry, baby.

- It's okay.
- No, no, no!

You ever shoot crack?

No.

Ever eat mescaline-laced
mushrooms?

Inhales Nope.

Put a tequila-soaked tampon
up your ass?

What?
No, dude.

I get it. I'm-- I'm obviously
not as cool as you.

Smells good.

Yeah, it's, um, primo stuff.

20 bucks a joint.

Can I buy five?

Yeah, sure thing.

I'm Casper.

- Lip.
- Grizz.

You live around here?

About four blocks over.

Cool.
Coughs

I guess.

Where you from?

Uh, Lakeshore.

I didn't choose it,
I was just born there.

What are you doing
slumming it down here?

Chuckles City Youth.

We're, uh, beautifying Chicago
one block at a time.

Good luck with that.

Those flowers-- they're not
gonna last about two hours.

Just looks good
on my tufts application.

Admissions people are into you
helping out the poor and shit.

Oh, sorry.

It's okay.

I'm not offended.

Hey, uh,

you interested in beautifying

any other parts
of the neighborhood?

Anything to beef up my CV.

Think I may have
something for you.

See if I can work it out.

Dude, hit me up anytime.

I'm on Facebook.
Casper Duncan.

You got it, Casper Duncan.

Man, that was good.

Missed ya.

You did?

Yeah, man.

I had to do
all the fucking in juvie.

Otherwise I'd end up
someone's bitch, right?

Nice to switch back.

Thought you had
four more months.

Yeah, let me out
for overcrowding or some shit.

Coming back to school?

Spits, scoffs

Hell, no, man.
I'd still be a fuckin' freshman.

I haven't passed
a single class.

Why'd you come back, then?

Fronted a bunch of coke
before I went in.

Time to collect.

Oh!

That's good.

So good.

Third call this week
from that same woman, Kev.

- She won't leave a message?
- No.

Probably a fucking
bill collector.

Can you just keep
dodging her, please?

Hi, baby.
How's the foot?

It's goddamn itchy.

What are you two
foxy ladies up to?

Need to bum some liquor off ya.

For her club night.

What, they don't
have booze over there?

She'll make more money
if she brings her own.

All right.
Hobble this way.

Honky-tonk music playing

?

Women chuckling

Okay, how much you need?

More than this.

There's gonna be at least
200 people there, babe.

Have you ever seen
more than 20 deadbeats

in here at one time?

What about
your liquor distributor?

Could I get
the booze from them?

Yeah, maybe.

Walter's a cool enough guy,
for a Roselli.

What? You're dealing with
the mob? You never told me that.

Stan burned
every bridge in town.

Walter's the only
liquor distributor

that'll do business with us.

How much would the booze cost?

For 200 people?
Top shelf? Close to 5 grand.

For well drinks,
you'd probably get away with 3.

Would he let me set up
an account and invoice me later?

Yeah, maybe.
He'll do a credit check, though.

I've got perfect credit.

No credit does not
equal perfect credit.

Do you even have
a social security number?

He'll want you to leave
one of the kids as collateral.

Okay, I get it.

I'll just buy the booze
from him up front, then.

Whose money you gonna use?

Douche bag.

Rock music

?

Uniform sales.

Bus driver.

Short order cook.

- How's it going, Jim-nasium?
- Hey, what's going on?

Can I borrow
some money from you?

Yeah, sure, how much?

$5,000? Pay you back
after my club night?

What?

Yeah, kinda strapped right now.

I got, like, uh,
300 bucks on me.

Are those my jeans, Frank?

Found 'em upstairs in my room.

It's not your room anymore.

You're cutting
her jeans into shorts?

Had three pair of my own,
but somebody tossed my clothes.

These are, like, $120.

I got 'em at Goodwill
for, like, 40 bucks!

Sighs

Can you go to the bank
and get more money?

I don't have any.

What about your parents?

I haven't gotten anything
from them since I was 18.

- Really? College?
- Cars, insurance.

Okay, I haven't gotten any
cash from them since I was 18.

For two years you've been
offering to give me money,

and now when I ask,
you don't have any?

I'm sorry.

This is why I never
ask anybody for help.

- I feel like a jackass now.
- Whoa, hey. Are you mad at me?

Because you get mad at me
when I offer you money,

and now you're getting mad
because I can't?

I'll just figure it out
myself, okay?

- Okay.
- Let's go, V.

Frank, what the hell?

I got that roast chicken
for dinner tonight!

My house, my kitchen,
my fridge, my chicken.

I cut these too short.
My balls are hanging out.

Yeah.

Nice ass.

Scoffs Thought you were
my history teacher Mr. Crouch.

Well, sorry to disappoint.

Hey, how was Community Service?

Yeah, good.

I met some North Side kids.

Think I can make
some dough off 'em.

Cool.

Yeah, gotta do what I can

with my sister stealing a bunch
of our property tax money.

Well, that was cunty of her.

You know, you should be in
charge of your family's money,

not Fiona.

Mr. Gallagher,
just left Mr. Healey's office.

Rumors about you two true?

Said you were supposed
to ask me for a recommendation.

Sure, in his mind,
I was supposed to do that.

A letter of recommendation
from a science teacher

looks good
on your college applications.

Bet it does.

So we got 20 cases of beer,
16 cases of wine,

got two cases of champagne.

I got 10 liters of vodka,
six gin, four rum,

four scotch, four bourbon,
and enough mixers and garnishes

for, like, 200 people.

- Sound about right?
- Yup.

And I can return
whatever I don't use?

Absolutely.

Let me just tally this up here
for you.

What are you doing?

Scoffs Ordering booze.
What's it look like?

I hope the payment
doesn't involve my titties.

Okay, my dear,
I got you in at $4,857,

which includes the 10% discount
'cause you're a friend of Kev's.

And I went ahead
and waived the delivery fee

'cause you're
a first-time customer.

How would you like
to pay for this?

- Check.
- Need a pen?

Yes, please.

Let me go check the schedule,

see what time we'll get this
out to you, okay?

Mm-hmm.

- 'Scuse me.
- Yes.

Is there more than $17
in that account?

By the time the check clears,
I'll have it covered.

The guy is in the mob.

You' cutting him a check
trading on Kev's good name?

Gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

If I don't invest in myself,
no one else ever will.

Knocks

Muffled Come in.

Oh, surprised to see you

at the college counseling
center, Miss Milkovich.

Came to talk to you about Lip.

I'm not at liberty
to discuss another student,

but I'd be more than happy
to help you

with your future options.

Scoffs Please.

You and I both know
my only options

are getting pregnant
or getting arrested,

so cut the crap.

Okay.

Then Lip.

He's got a good chance
of getting out of here.

And what are you
doing about it?

Encouraging him
to go to college.

Doesn't seem to be
too interested.

You're a guidance counselor.
Fucking guide him.

There's only so much I can do.

- What should he be doing?
- Keeping his grades up.

Getting teacher
recommendations,

finding himself
a legitimate job,

filling out
his college applications.

Now, you think you can help
with any of that?

Maybe.

All right, stop by
at the end of the day,

I'll post
some college brochures,

you could take 'em with you.

I think you have
a better chance

of getting through to him
than I did, Lysistrata.

What?

Show up for English
once in a while,

and you'll get the reference.

All right.

Let's go, buddy.

All right.

Yeah.

Daddy.

No, I'm not black enough or
drunk enough to be your daddy.

Whoa!

- Mommy.
- Yeah.

Mommy.

You seriously gonna keep
following me everywhere I go?

It's my job.

Don't you ever have
to go to the bathroom?

Okay.
Dialing phone

Okay, Liam.
There you go.

Hey, Este, it's me.

Hi.
Panting

Why are you breathing so hard?

Gym.

You never know with you.

So Beto is sitting out front.

He follows me wherever I go.

Your father told him
to keep an eye on me?

- Don't worry. He's harmless.
- Who?

Your father or Beto?

Because neither of them
seemed harmless

when they were dicing up Marco.

Beer.
I need beer.

Panting

Just a second, Frank.

Stay out of trouble,
and you'll be fine.

All right, listen.
I gotta go.

I gotta run some errands,
make some money for Fiona.

Look, my dad is a hothead.

Blows off steam,
threatens lives,

and then cools down,
forgets why he was mad.

He is gemini.

He will call Beto off soon.

Okay.

Rock music

?

Gracias.

Hey, uh, 'scuse me.

What happened to all the meth
heads squatting in here?

Who the hell are you?

Concerned neighborhood citizen.

Took me six months
to get rid of 'em.

Yeah, I heard there were
dead bodies in there too.

Yeah. Four, yeah.
Coyotes got to 'em at one point.

Gonna take me eight weeks
to make it livable again.

How much you paying these guys?

Too much.

Might have
a better deal for you.

Gunshots, explosion

- How's the pasta?
- Good.

You're like our maid now.

Thanks, Carl.

Gunshots on TV

Car engine revs

Hey, Debs,
watch Liam for a bit.

- I gotta run an errand.
- No can do.

- Baby-sitting for Sheila.
- Carl.

Can I stay up late
and watch TV?

Absolutely.

Rock music

?

I'm going to Sheila's tonight,
daddy.

Baby-sitting.

A noble job, Debs.

That stupid baby's
still crying?

Won't stop.

Hey, that's my toothbrush.

And thanks
for sharing it with me, son.

- Oh, man, eew!
- Now that we're a family again,

I want to encourage us to be
all for one and one for all.

Ew, gonna have to boil it now.

You need the number
over at Sheila's?

Where I'll be.

No, why would I?

I'll be heading out
to the Alibi soon.

Oh, and don't worry about me
walking home late at night.

I have a pillowcase
full of bars of soap.

Good for you.

You get along a lot better

with a weapon and a kind word
than a kind word alone.

Any of that spaghetti left?

Gunshots on TV

Oh, darn it.

Sizzles

Ew.

Sighs

Drill whirring

What are you doing?

Keeping Frank out.

Planning to go
to Carnegie Mellon?

Please.

That's for nerds and homos.

But, um, Healey
thinks Lip should apply.

Fat chance.

He's smart enough.

Yeah, but too stupid
to do anything about it.

I already tried.

Hey, can I ask you a question?

Sure.

How do you know if a guy

you've been hanging out with
likes you?

You like him?

Uh-huh,
but I think he hates me.

Ask him.

Doesn't want to talk about it.

No guy ever does.

How do I know, then?

Does he get that look
in his eye when he's with you?

What look?

You'll know when you see it.

Hymie crying

Did you know that Abe Lincoln
lived in a one-room log cabin

when he was born, Hymie,

and that his grandfather was
ambushed and killed by indians?

Some historians say that
because he was cold to women,

he might've had
homosexual tendencies.

Debbie? Deb?

The whole point
of you baby-sitting Hymie

was to keep him quiet, so Jody
and I could get some sleep.

Sorry, Sheila, he won't stop.

Hymie crying

Why don't you take him
for a walk?

- Where?
- I don't care.

Just anywhere.

Just don't come back
for a few hours.

Okay?

Cell phone rings

Hey, what's up?

Hey, where are you?

I am...

Clicks running an errand.

Where are you?

Uh, at V's, changing.

I'm gonna run by the club,
talk to this promoter.

See if we can
get his email list

to invite more people
to my party.

Good idea.

You mind watching the kids?

Got it covered.

- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Okay, okay, okay, I'm out.
I'm out, I'm out.

Oh.

Why you steal Porsche?

I needed money
to help my girlfriend.

You have a car at home.
Sell that.

How am I
supposed to get around?

Nando will kill us both
if you get into trouble.

Okay, I promise
not to do it again, okay?

You betray me.

What are you doing?

Cracks Ow!

Fuck me!

Holy shit!

Clean break, I think.

Don't screw with me again.

Fine. Okay.

- Come on.
- Ow.

I take you to the hospital,

then we go get
American Whoppers, huh?

Car chirps

 You've got it

 the way
you grinding up on me

 I know, I know you want me

?

 the way
you kissing up on me

 I know, I know you need me

?

Hey, Meg, is Wendell around?

Uh, yeah, right over there.

 The way
you grinding up on me

Thanks.

I'll tell you this.

For all of their laziness
and lack of motivation,

Mexicans are a lovely people.

Why'd you go down there, Frank?

Hey, I'll take another, Kev.

Sometimes a man
just has to get away,

be alone with his thoughts.

Hey!

Jesus.

So what, you woke up
from a drunken stupor,

didn't know where you were?

I knew exactly where I was.

Had a business opportunity

with our south-of-the-border
brothers.

- What did you do to your foot?
- It fell off.

Was the only prosthetic
I could afford.

What kind
of business opportunity?

I was hired to move
some inventory.

Drug mule?

Only the best
the mexicanos have ever seen.

Not something you really want
to be bragging about, Frank.

- Which end did it go in?
- Yo, Frank.

Some chick's outside
with a baby looking for you.

Oh, no.

- Who is it, Frank?
- I-I-I don't know.

But does that sound like
good news to you?

I'm gonna slip out the back.

Sounds like you were

slipping it out the back
in Mexico, Frank.

Laughter

Baby crying

Shh.

Daddy.

Wait, you're the chick
with the baby?

Kev won't let me in
after 6:00 PM anymore.

What the hell's wrong
with Liam?

- This isn't Liam, it's Hymie.
- Well, jeez.

Shut him up.

Sheila has an oriental baby?

I have to finish
my Civil War project...

- Jesus.
- ...and he won't stop crying.

You were always
so good with Liam.

Give-- give him--
give him to me.

Open his mouth.

- What is that?
- Valium.

Are you supposed
to give Valium to a baby?

Oh, yeah.
It always worked with you.

Oh.
Hymie's crying subsides

Voila.

Thanks, daddy.

Hey, loan me 20 bucks, will ya?

Sighs

I only have five.

That'll do it.

Clattering I hate you!

Glass shatters

 Come, come, baby, yeah

 come, come, baby, yeah

 push my button,
make me wanna play

Chuckles

Your friend likes to dance.

The tequila likes to dance.

Yeah.

So you think
you're gonna be able

to pull this off
tomorrow night?

Hope so.

I bet you will.

Looks like you have
some real talent.

You're not talking about my
club promoting skills, are you?

What makes you say that?

Your hand on my knee.

I meant to put it
up your skirt.

Oh.

What are the chances of me

getting ahold
of your email lists?

Why would I give them to you?

Mm, satisfaction of knowing
you're helping a good person.

No, I can't come inside that.

I could give you
a cut of my bar, then.

10%?

You know how long it took me
to build up my list?

You honestly think I'd risk it
on you throwing some lame party

and ruining my brand
for anything less than 50%?

Well,
that's an interesting offer.

Let me discuss it
with my partner.

 Come, come, baby, yeah,
come, come, baby, yeah

He wants 50% of the bar
for his email list,

and he's a giant douche bag.

No worries.

I swiped his phone
from his jacket

as soon as I saw
his hand on your knee.

Has all his contacts.

Gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

- Aah!
- Aah!

- Debbie?
- Nighty-night, Hymie.

Whispers Oh, my goodness.

How did you do it, Debbie?

Whispers
Daddy's good with babies.

Frank?

Sighs

You just getting home?

Oh, hey.
Still awake?

Where have you been?

Uh, Emergency Room.
Slammed it in the door.

- Yeah.
- Well, you're in trouble.

You let Carl stay up late
on a school night.

Oh.

I think you need a spanking.

Hmm?

I can't do it
with your pants on, though.

Then I should take them off.

Very bad boy.

I've been a bad, bad boy.

Bad.

This Purdue place looks cool.

I want mommy to show me
how bad I've been.

There's no way she's gonna

make the money back
for the property tax.

Says they're one of the top

engineering schools
in the country.

I'm gonna have
to figure out a way

to make up the 1,000 bucks
she's gonna lose.

Giggling You listening to me?

Yeah, you know,
it's kind of hard

with the, uh, porno going
on across the hall.

Is it wrong that
it's kind of turning me on?

Yeah, me too.

Giggling

Muffled speech

- Morning.
- Hey.

Jimmy gonna come down
to make us breakfast?

He's sleeping in.
Eat your cereal.

- Wore him out, huh?
- You too. Eat your cereal.

Spoiled now.
Need an omelet.

So, um, how's the club night
thing coming?

Gonna be a big success.

Probably make enough money
to roll it into another one.

Take out a small loan,
really get things going.

What's wrong, Debs?

Sighs Got home late.

Baby-sitting.

So the ghetto girl

thinks she can live
the American dream, huh?

Maybe it's my time, Lip.

Chuckles
None of your business, Mandy.

Don't you see,
it doesn't work like that, sis.

When you're poor,
only way to make money

is to steal it or scam it,

like Don King or Joe Kennedy.

Daddy's home!

- Brought friends.
- Howdy!

- Just dump it.
- Hey, that's my bike!

Doesn't really work anymore.

Yeah, because you
bent the rim, Frank.

And where's the seat?

That's why it hurt so much
when I rode it.

Come on, fellas.

Get some brekkie,
soak up the alcohol.

- Do you have sourdough?
- Hey, this is our food!

Don't be rude.

Is this about money, Fiona?

Because I am happy
to pay my share.

That's all you ever want
from me anymore anyway.

There.
You happy, huh?

That's about $300 worth.

Come on, lads!

Let's go upstairs,
take a disco nap

till the Alibi's open again.

Dad, no, no.

- Lip, don't.
- This is my home.

You have no right
to kick me out of it.

I am an important part
of this family.

No, you're not.

You don't live here anymore.

Fine.

If that's the way
you want it, I'll leave.

Phil, Chester, I'm sorry.

My family
doesn't want me here anymore.

Charge!

Overlapping chatter

Jackass!

That's it.
Let's go! Go!

Stop it, guys!
Stop!

Just pick a bed, fellas!
Just pick a bed. Oh, my God!

What the hell are you doing?

Shouting

Get the fuck outta here!

Come.
You are not sleeping here.

- No, stop!
- Come on.

Get up, get up!

Overlapping chatter
He's not doing anything!

You are not going to--

- Go!
- What's the matter with you?

Gasps

Well, that's
a piece of shit anyway.

Sighs

Frank!

Debs...

Damn it, Frank,
get the fuck out!

No, you cannot do this to her!

- Come on! Get up right now!
- Jesus! What's the--

- Get out!
- Get out!

Jesus!

Stop!

I treated you well!
And you--

- Ow!
- How could you do this to me?

Stop! Stop--

Get out of my house!
I hate you!

- I don't even care!
- Jesus!

Get out! Get out!

Dad.

- Get him out.
- Ow, God!

- Debs!
- Debs!

Muffled crying

Get out!

I hate you! Get--

don't you touch me!

Panting

Sobs Oh, my God.

Get out!

After everything
I have done for you,

this is the thanks I get.

- Where should we put him?
- Where he belongs.

- Open it up, Carl!
- Got it.

Whatever, you--

Jesus Christ!

Not funny!
Not funny at all!

Gonna need you to clean
the blood splatter on the walls,

evidence marks on the floor,
and patch up the bullet holes.

That should get you started.

- Supplies are inside.
- Shit.

You okay, buddy?

Been trying all morning
to get tickets

to the Wilco concert
at Soldier Field tonight.

- Can't get through.
- Wilco?

Aren't they for, like, dads with
receding hairlines and shit?

Come on, Wilco is the beacon
of anti-commercialism.

Yeah, because no one
wants to buy their whiny music,

they gotta give it away
for free.

Shit.

All right, here you go.
It's 50 bucks a head.

That's $400.

Hey, hey, um,

is there any chance I can get an
advance on the next couple days?

Hey, slow your roll, kid.

I haven't seen
what they could do yet.

- Se√±or.
- Yeah?

This man stole our jobs?

No, no, I didn't steal them,
I just underbid you.

But we are illegal immigrants.
How can you underbid us?

Ghetto white's the new brown.

- The what?
- The new brown.

This is unfair.

Just living
the American dream, amigo!

Okay, let's keep eight cases
of that beer up front,

and put the rest
in the back refrigerator.

Hello.

People showing up already?

 Turn it up, turn it off now

- ? turn it up... ?
- Can I help you?

Alderman Edward Gretsky,
15th Ward.

Okay.

Throwing a party, I see.

Something like that.

Just a friendly visit.

You know, make sure you filled
out all your applications.

Applications?

Business license, liquor
license, umbrella insurance.

Well, I'm sure Meg handled
everything that you need.

She did.
For her business.

What?

Well, you're running
the show now, right?

Well, just for tonight.

Then just for tonight

I'll make an exception
on the applications for...

small filing fee.

- A filing fee?
- Let's say $1,000.

Wouldn't want
any pesky policemen or firemen

showing up now, would we?

?

I'll come back later
to collect.

Let's say 2:00 AM.

?

How is the pinky?

It's doing okay.

So listen, my girlfriend's
having a party tonight.

It's important that I go.

Is there going to be
alcohol there?

It's a party, it's kind of
how these things work, yeah.

- Drugs?
- Maybe.

- Bad things may happen.
- Yeah, or not.

I go with you.
Just to make sure.

Yeah, see, that's the thing
is that you can't go with me

because then I'll have
to explain who you are,

how I know you,
that my life's in danger.

I mean, that won't
go over very well.

Then you stay home.

Rock music

?

Hey, Sanchez.

- Aw, hell.
- Time to pay up.

- They let you out?
- Good behavior.

I thought I had
four more months.

Think again.

Hey, yo,
campus security is coming.

The hell are you doing?

Didn't want you to get busted.

I can look after myself,
thank you.

Does he get that look
in his eye-- look in his eye--

look in his eye
when he's with you?

Just got outta juvie, remember?

- The fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

You look great.

Thanks, Debs.

You okay with what happened
this morning? Frank?

Jimmy's in the bathroom puking.

Sighs

Vomiting

Knocks What's going on?

Something I ate.
It's not sitting well.

Vomits You need anything?

Vomiting loudly

No, I'm just bummed
I can't make it tonight.

I mean, I really wanted to go.
Flushes toilet

If you feel better later,
come on over, okay?

Okay.

Knocks
Go away. We're not buying.

Banging

Jeez.

I know, I know,
you want me to find Jesus.

I already found him, thanks.

I'm looking for Kev.

Kevin Ball.

I'm his wife.

 I ask myself why
but I don't know

 fairy tales...

Tommy!

Hey, you still got that garage?

Yeah, it kinda
comes with the house, Frank.

Great. What's say
you let me sleep there?

What's say I don't.

- Why the hell not?
- Because the last time

you stayed at my place,
you shit in my kitchen sink.

The layout of your home
is very confusing.

No, Frank.

No means no.

Fuck you, Tommy.

Fuck you means fuck you.

Kermit!

My best friend.

You can't stay with me, Frank.

Wh-- what if
I suck your dick?

Frank.

What if you immigrate
to Mexico, Frank?

Reverse the prevailing tide.

Why are you even here?

Should be
collecting disability.

'Cause I didn't
injure my foot at work.

Hey, let me crash
at your place.

I'll tell the insurance company
that you did.

Why can't you stay
at your place, Frank?

Ungrateful little shits!
That's why.

Things I do for them.

Blood, sweat, and tears.

This is not how a family
treats each other. Phone ringing

Yeah.

Hang on.
It's for you. V.

Hey, baby, what's going on?

What?

No, yeah, okay.

Okay, I'll be right there.

Watch the bar.

Little redheaded bitch
is the worst of 'em.

Expect it from the others,
but not from--

not from--
from...

her--
Debbie.

Orphan Annie turned on me.

That's how I got
all these bruises.

She hit me.
With a bat.

Now, I can't touch her.
No.

That is child abuse.
I'd get reported.

Rock music

?

Operator, can you connect me
with Child Welfare Ser--

Services?

Yes, hello.
I would like to report, uh...

a-a negligence situation.

2119 North Wallace.

Gallagher.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.

Not-- n-not that they
don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, viol-- What?

No, if it's all right, I would
like to remain anonymous.

No, thank you.

And God bless you.

That is an all-time low.

Even for you, Frank.

?

 charge amex, see

 like you got an "A,"
score credit

 living that American dream

 you could be a celebrity

 when you step on the scene

 I know you gotta look hot

 you and your girls
with dresses

 turn that sound up

 you are in the limelight

 until they cut
your power out

 shopping like a rich girl

 rich girl, like a rich girl

 shopping like a rich girl

Hey, V, where are you?

This place is insane!
We did it!

 like a rich girl

 credit card, max it out

Muffled club music

?

Hey, is this the club

where Wilco's gonna play
a secret concert?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, uh,

20 bucks, self-parked.
30 valet.

- I'll park it myself.
- Cool.

Uh, just pull over
right down there.

That lovely lady
will show you to your spot.

- Thank you.
- Cool. Have fun.

- Yo.
- Hey, Lip.

How you doing, man?

Good. Got your text about
the impromptu Wilco concert.

Tweeted everyone I know.

Thought you might.

Hey, hop out.
I'll have someone park your car.

- Thanks.
- Cool.

Surf rock music

?

How long we doing this for?

Figure we park
about 30 more cars,

make enough money to cover
the property tax,

at which time people
will probably start to realize

Wilco's not playing
at Fiona's club.

Then we bolt.

Out.

Where am I supposed to go?

Hymie crying

Just-- just shake him.
Hymie crying

You're not supposed
to shake a baby.

I know, but maybe it'll
make him stop crying.

Yeah, because his brains
will get scrambled.

- They already are!
- Sheila!

I'm just saying maybe it'll

scramble 'em
back together again.

Howdy, folks.

You need help with that baby?

- Frank?
- How'd you get in my house?

I still have a key.

I-I-I got a proposition
for you, Sheila.

- What? No!
- Frank, you have to leave.

No, let me stay,
and I'll be your wet nurse.

I don't mean your wet nurse,
that involves breast-feeding,

but your nurse,
your baby nurse.

Room and board, you'll get
eight hours of sleep a night.

I can promise you that.

Debbie did say
he was good with babies.

There, you see?
My reputation precedes me.

Just give me five minutes.

Aw, hell.
Give me 30 seconds.

If I can't put
this little tyke to sleep,

I'll-- I'll leave, pronto.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hymie crying

Yeah, yeah.
Oh, oh.

I got you.

Raised eight kids myself.

I know what I'm doing.
Chuckles

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Here you go.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Hymie quiets Yeah.

Ah.

H-how--

how did you do that, Frank?

I think I'll take
a shower before bed.

75, 76, 78.

Okay. Just over 10 grand.

That's not bad.

So, 15% for you.

I thought we agreed on 20.

Right.

$2,000.

Thank you.

Take mine anytime you're ready.

Look forward to doing business
with you in the future.

This is to cover my booze.

And that leaves me
with 2 grand.

Didn't forget
about us, did you?

Of course not.

Thanks, Fiona.

 Do you want my love, boy

- ? do you want my love ?
- Five, six, seven, eight...

$900?

That's all I have left?

That's not bad
for your first gig.

But that doesn't even
cover my deposit.

I lost $100 doing this night.

Surprised you didn't lose more.

It took me, like, eight gigs
before I saw a profit.

You gotta pay your dues.

?

 do you want my love

Distant police sirens wail

Hey.

What's going on?

Can I sleep here tonight?

Sure.

How'd you do?

It's gonna take a while
till I start making money.

Here.
Almost all of it.

I'll get the rest, I promise.

- Ah, keep it.
- What?

Well, if you're gonna gamble
our money,

you should hold onto it, right?

Scoffs I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

Oh, congratulations.

You risked everything,
and you didn't even break even.

It was my first time
doing this.

That's not the point.

You made a decision without
consulting the rest of us.

- I'm in charge of this family.
- Really?

No, I'm sorry, that's--
that's news to me.

You see, Fiona, if we're gonna
be every man for himself,

this family
is going under fast.

Here,
just take the money, okay?

Pay the property tax. I'll get
the rest tomorrow somehow.

No, I don't need it.

What?

I took care
of the situation myself.

How?

Told a bunch of North Side kids

that Wilco was playing
at your party.

It's like I said.

The only way to make money
when you're poor

is to steal it or scam it.

But hey, um, let me know if
the rules are changing, right,

and you're gonna pull
this shit again?

Maybe I'll have to take
over the family money, huh?

Rock music

?

Are we sure about this?

He raised six great kids.

Look at him.

He's like the baby whisperer.

?





For those of you who were doing

open-heart surgery or bringing
peace to the Mid-East

or whatever the fuck
you were doing,

this is what you missed
on Shameless last week.

Baby crying It's your turn.

Get your goddamn ass
out of this bed!

It's your fucking turn!

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

Hymie has his first well baby
appointment today.

I'll take him.

Nice place you got here.

- What are you doing here?
- I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips
and a ginger snap.

- Can I help you?
- This is my son, Hymie.

Our organization
works with dying children.

Of course.
I know that.

It's my other child
that's dying.

Carl.
Carl.

- A word.
- Cancer?

You said you cater
to dying children.

Camp?

I've never been to camp.

Here he comes.

Hey, thanks for bailing me out.

All Mandy.

She used her dad's
line of credit

at Bad Bob's bonds.

Mandy.
Bein' smart?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Excuse me.
I was thinking

there might be a job opening.

Tell me, Fiona.

How do you feel
about deli meats?

Are you saying that,
if I blow you,

I can have a job?

Hey, V, do you still have

that mini camera you use
for titty shots?

He's right in there.
Do you know what you're doing?

I got it all on tape.
He's nasty.

I want day shifts,
home by 6:00.




The High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 think of all the luck
you got

 know that it's not
for naught

 you were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 what is this down side

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 round up the friends
you got

 know that they're not
for naught

 you were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 what is this down side

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Stay down.

Stay down!

- Stay. Stay.
- How long was that?

Not long enough.
You need at least 90 seconds.

City pools are filled
with city kids,

and by "city kids"
I mean black kids who swim.

Little stereotype-breakers,

like those two kids that ripped
your bathing suit last year.

They were turning it
into a bikini.

If they'll do that
when you're just running

through the sprinklers
at your own house,

think what they'll do
when they have

a large body of water
at their disposal.

Savage little cosby kids

will drown your ass.

Times have changed.

Yeah, that's what they said

when they were holding me
underwater repeatedly

in the summer of '67,

the so-called
summer of love.

Not at the Sullivan Street pool,
it wasn't.

It was the summer
of drowning whitey.

And until you can hold
your breath

longer than they can hold
their breath,

you're not going
to Sullivan Street.

Sighs Go.

Whoa, can I try?

No, Carl, you've got cancer.

Pack your bag.
We're leaving.

Telephone rings

Grunting

Milkovich house.
Speak briefly, then shut up.

Both moaning

Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.

The lady upstairs is gonna tell
the police I'm an orphan

if a family member
doesn't come get me.

Please come.

Answering machine beeps

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister,

whose meth head mother
apparently died.

What?
You have a sister?

Half.

Want to finish?

Sure.

Oh, my God, you are so
unbelievably tasty right now.

Giggles

Don't wait for me.

What, are you charging

- by the minute, Madam V?
- Yes.

Well, thank you
for watching my wallet,

you dirty little whore.

I am a dirty little whore.

Put me on my back,
would you, please?

Oh, hello.
Giggles

Moans

Oh, you've been working
on your Kegels.

Oh.
Oh, you're flexing this.

Moans Oh, you're flexing,

oh, you're flexing that.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Exclaims

Roll over, Hulk Hogan.

Both groaning

You want me to finish you off?

I'm good, hon. We got to save
your sperm for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

You cool?

Yeah.

Yeah, it just--
I just wish you had given me

a heads-up before I went
with the whole whore thing.

You know, I don't want
our kid's first impression

of you to be
that you're a whore.

It was making you hot.
Hot is good.

We got to help your spermies
rocket to my egg.

Well, just don't be
upside-down too long.

My sperm get dizzy.

Giggles Ooh!

Shh, shh, shh.

You all packed?

I need a sleeping bag.

Just staple
some sheets together.

This camp's got a rifle range

and woods all around a lake.

I'm definitely
gonna kill something,

like a grizzly,

mountain lion, maybe a tiger.

Or I might just go in the canoe
and shoot some fish.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you,

a world your other siblings
will never get to experience.

But they don't know
that this camp

is only for kids with cancer,
so, like I said before,

you must keep that secret.

Are you still someone
I can trust?

Why am I the only one
who caught cancer from grammy?

Life is rife
with questions that baffle.

All we can do is carry on.

Am I going to die?

Time will tell.

But don't you worry.
I'm working on a cure.

- You all packed up?
- Shh.

- Yup.
- What's Hymie doing here?

I'm baby-sitting.

Oh, is Sheila
popping pills again?

Sheila happens
to think very highly

of my ability to raise
bright, independent children.

You're not leaving
Hymie here, Frank.

Debbie can't take care
of a special needs kid

on top of day care.

Challenges foster growth.

You can't prevent Debbie
from an opportunity to grow.

Not happening.

Carl, what are you doing?

Making a sleeping bag.

- These are Lip's sheets.
- Not anymore.

All right,
take my ROTC sleeping bag, huh?

- Really?
- Yeah.

I'll grab it from upstairs.

Why couldn't you win
a raffle for camp

- when I was little, Frank?
- Fortune dispenses randomly.

I hated camp.

Don't listen to Jamie, Carl.

Jimmy.

You okay holding down the fort

with Debbie's day care insanity
starting up again?

Jamie's got it.
Jamie is all over it.

Okay, little man.
See you in a week.

Laughs

I just want to say
thanks for being a great sister.

I may have never said that,

but now I did.

- You okay, Carl?
- Yeah.

Okay, I left a list of stuff
we need at the store.

You kicking in
for squirrel fund this month?

Absolutely. Yeah.
I'm living here.

Got to do my part.

Don't have to.

"Want."
Want to.

Debbie!
Day care starting!

Wow.
Thanks, Ian.

I got a couple more things
for camp too--

bug spray,
and Swiss army knife.

For comfort and convenience,
not as weapons.

Awesome.

See you in a week, pal.

See ya.

Dad, we should go.

Coming!

Stay away from people
with cancer, little dude.

Okay, who's ready
for breakfast burritos?

Me!

- So this sister...
- Half.

She's just waiting somewhere

for your dad to go pick her up?

Near Milwaukee.

He gonna do it?

No.

So you think maybe,
I don't know,

maybe you should call her,

tell her he's not coming?

No call answers that question

just as good as a call does...

So you're cool with your sister

going in
the foster care system?

Well, the system's
better than here.

Yeah, says the girl who,
miraculously,

has never been in the system.

She have any other relatives?

Who knows?
Look, it sucks,

but there's nothing
I can do about it.

She sounded desperate.

I mean, let's-- let's see
if we could get her.

Let's see if we can help.

- Help how?
- I don't know.

Maybe locate the rest
of her family.

How are we gonna do that?

I don't know, drive up there,
figure it out.

In the car
that neither of us have?

- She's your sister.
- Half.

There's a coupon
in the flyer for this.

- Do you have one?
- I left it at home.

There's a stack of 'em
right over there.

No reason the store
should have that 75 cents.

Adolpho, delivery ready
at register three.

Princess, it's time
for your break.

Princess, stop working so hard.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's not a "break" break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

Will you be coming up
for parents day, Mr. Gallagher?

No. No, no.
Working.

No time to relax.

Being able to afford
Carl's cancer drugs

means a lot of time
at the foundry.

And, if I'm late, I get docked.

I get docked too many times,
I get fired.

If I get fired,
I lose my benefits,

benefits that
will provide treatments

to extend Carl's life

past the doctor's
original dire predictions.

We'll take good care
of him, I promise.

Thank you.

Okay, folks, bus is leaving.

- Get your hugs in.
- Okay, check it out.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

Take one a day.
They'll give you the energy

to get through camp.

Will they cure my cancer?

Depends on your attitude.

I love you, dad.

Okay.
Okay, good.

There you go.
Be brave.

Both: 10, 11, 12,

13...

1, 2, 3...

4, 5...

Ashish, it's not your turn.

What number did I get up to?

5! Or 13.

Whoo!
Yummy time.

It's been a while, hasn't it?

- What has?
- Since we had sex.

Oh, yeah.

Sleep deprivation's
the silent romance killer.

Who thought Frank
would be the cure?

- Jody?
- Yeah.

Would you want to stay here
a little bit?

Oh, you want to snuggle?

Jody's always down
for maximum snuggums.

I was thinking maybe we could

mix into snuggle time

a little toy time?

Sheila, we've been over this.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

It's good to be nervous.

- Not true.
- Please.

Sheila, sweetheart,

I can't, okay?

I like what we have now.

Let's not ruin it.

Breakfast in a sec?

 I've been working
on the railroad

All:  all the livelong day

 I've been working
on the railroad

 just to
 pass the time away

Yo.
I'm Hanley.

Carl. What up?

Not my red blood cell count.

What kind do you got?

The kind that kills kids.
You?

Same.

Fiona, I need you
to trade breaks with me later.

Sure.
When do I punch out?

Bobby'll tell you.

And a little tip
I tell all the new gals,

I don't punch out
when I pull my extra break.

If I'm in the building,
I'm gonna get compensated

for whatever work I do.

Makes sense.

When it's my day, I punch in,

go home, nap,

do shit with my boyfriend,

come back, do Bobby,

go back home,
and still don't punch out.

I have one of the gals
on the late shift

punch me out at close.

Get paid for a double,
and I only work 15 minutes.

Reason I need you to go for me

is 'cause I got a bunch
of canker sores.

I need a break
from the sucky-suck,

if you know what I mean.

Jennica, could I go
for you next week?

I just got my teeth cleaned
at the free clinic,

and the trainee hygienist
just shredded my gums.

Been there.
No worries.

I'll ask Lucy.
I got seniority.

I got the evening Bobby shift,
which is easy-peasy.

By then, basically his dick
is just coughing up smoke.

Pancakes are in the oven.

Great session.

Yummy time, mucho yum.

He looks so happy and peaceful.

If ignorance is bliss,

then Down Syndrome's
got to be euphoria.

How are the pancakes?

Filling.

Do you ever miss
what we used to have?

Your crepes?
Definitely.

Jody's not much of a cook.

I mean, the--

the things
that we would do together.

Our social calendar
was never that full.

No, I mean,

like, the things.

I'm talking about what you and I
used to have in bed.

Oh.

No.

You let me be in charge.
Remember?

Jody only wants

to cuddle and do it
like missionaries.

- Cuddling's good.
- It's boring.

And uneventful.

I need events!

I want eventful play!

- Shh.
- I want to be in charge.

Well, then be in charge.

Be forceful.
Jody's malleable.

He's not.

I've tried.

Would you talk to him?

No.

I have needs, Frank.

I have needs.

I don't think I ask
for too much.

Crying
I don't know what to do.

Oh, no, please don cry

when I'm eating.

Whimpers

I'm sorry.

Just I miss it.

I miss it so, so much.

And the missing makes me sad.

All right, all right.
I'll talk to him.

Really?
You will?

Yes, if you'll stop crying

and let me enjoy
my pancakes, yes.

I can stop crying.
I can stop crying.

I can.
I can stop crying.

Stifled crying

You're visiting a Milkovich
sister nobody's ever heard of

in Milwaukee?

Uh, correct.

And you're gonna do what?

We are going to evaluate
her well-being

and, if need be, rescue her.

You mean kidnap?

Provide transport
to a safer haven.

- Kidnap.
- Rescue.

Bad idea.

Look, a kid's in trouble,

we're gonna help.

Crossing state lines
to bring a minor

back to the Milkovich house
of horror seems more like abuse.

Look, her mother's dead,
she's home alone,

and she's scared.

Welcome
to the predictable consequences

of using crystal meth.

Engine struggles to turn over

Have you ever driven this thing

more than four
consecutive miles?

Revving

Rock music



What's that smell?

Fresh air.

Where's the rifle range?

Don't think we have that
anymore.

Then why's it on the pamphlet?

That is a worthwhile inquiry.

You shouldn't have put it
on the pamphlet

- if you don't have it.
- Well, let's go check.

Come on.

 Without windows



Groans Damn it.

You all right, Lucy?

No, I'm not all right.

I was filling in
for Jennica on her--

I was filling in
for Jennica's Bobby break,

and now I got Bobby juice
on the blouse

that I am wearing
to Cuban Night.

So now Jennica's gonna get

her car keyed,
because I am fed up

with coworkers who always seem

to have canker sore outbreaks
when it's their turn.

Hey, don't forget
to backload those.



 There was a farmer

 who had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 and Bingo was his name-o

You want to sing along
with us, Carl?

I want to shoot a rifle.

Got some info for you
on that one.

We no longer offer
a rifle range.

That's bullshit!

Language, please, Carl.

There's a range
on the pamphlet.

How about I teach you
to play chess?

How about I call Action 4 News
and tell them

you're lying
to a bunch of dying kids

on what they get to do
at this horseshit camp!

I'm sorry, Carl.

I want to go to the forest
and kill something.

Let's find you
something safe to do,

yet still thrilling,

like making
a tie-dyed t-shirt.

You don't have to want it.

Doing things
you don't want to do

is how you make
a relationship work.

I can't, Frank.
I'm sorry.

Sex toys are a gateway choice.

Toys can be mind-expanding.

I just got my one-year chip
from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

Part of my recovery's
to make certain

that I only have
loving, committed sex.

No battery-powered aides
allowed.

She just wants
to kick it up a notch.

Make her happy.

The key
to my continued happiness

is to have loving sex
infrequently.

I've mastered
the infrequent part.

This isn't about
your happiness.

It's about Sheila's.

I finally got my life
back under control.

If I kick it up a notch,

there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

Oh, would you stop bragging?

We're all sex addicts, man.

10, 12 times a day?

What, thinking about it?
Yeah. More.

No, the act.
Arousal and release.

Before I got into SA,

I was having sex
10, 12 times a day.

Giving or receiving?

Never receiving.
I was destroying.

Destroying?

That's what I used to call it.
"Destroying pussy."

You all make coming to work
such a delight.

10, 12 times a day?
The same woman?

Never. That's the thing
about the internet.

Once you announce
your depravity,

there's plenty of other
depravers seeking company.

I mean,
if you put it out there,

you can find a ton
of willing participants

who want to be humiliated
having sex.

I got to re-up
my AOL account.

One week,
I had 32 different partners.

Didn't cost me a dime.

Toys, contraptions,

restraints.

You know,
you start messing around,

you think you're under control,

but eventually you abuse
your arousal center,

needing stranger and stranger
shit to flip your switch.

I mean,

I started to look at sex
like a fight,

and my weapon was my cock.

I knew I really had a problem
when I couldn't get hard

unless I was slapping it
in the face

of a woman who was pretending
she was crying.

I underestimated you, Jody.

In a bar
full of depraved people,

you are the Grand Poobah
of depravity.

Was.

Won't be again.

What do I owe you
for the ginger ale, Kev?

- Vanilla or chocolate?
- Mixed.

You got any rainbow sprinkles?

They discontinued
using sprinkles last summer.

Some brands of food coloring
have been linked to cancer.

I already have cancer.
This camp blows.

No sprinkles?
What is this, Mexico?

We're trying to create
an enjoyable--

Create a way to get some
sprinkles here before we die.

Hey, kids,
it's Moppy the clown.

Cheers

Yo, Carl, way to speak up.

Want to go check out the lake?

Sure.
I'll go ask.

Don't ask.
Just go.

But they'll get mad

if we don't ask permission.

Cancer is our permission.

We've been at this camp

for a whole day
without seeing the lake.

I've never seen a lake before.

- Not even Lake Michigan?
- Where's that?

I didn't get a chance
to swing by the bank today,

but I'll get some money
in the squirrel fund tomorrow.

- I promise, okay?
- Okay.

How'd it go today?

Weird.
Day care?

No kids lost limbs.
No kids were lost by Jim.

Excellent.

How'd cashier work get weird?

I think everyone at work
other than me

is blowing the manager.

That's genius.

Evil genius.

Taking advantage of women

who can't afford
to lose their jobs?

- It's sick.
- Then quit.

I need the job.
Overtime. Benefits.

But eventually,
they're all gonna realize

I'm not carrying
my share of the load.

Literally.

Maybe I can figure out a way
to make 'em all stop

before they realize
I'm getting a free ride.

Yeah, if we stick together,

collectively boycott
giving him what he wants,

maybe it can stop.
There's strength in numbers.

United we stand.
Divided, we keep sucking dick.

Hey, revolutions have begun
with less inspiring phrases.

Cool.

Flat rocks skip better.

They pay for your braces

before or after they found out
you were dying?

I'm not dying.

You got cancer, dude.

You're dying.
We're all dying.

My dad got me
some special pills.

Good luck with that.

Seriously.

They ain't got no cure.

I thought this camp
was supposed to,

you know, like, help kids,
fresh air and that stuff.

The only kids
invited to this camp

are the ones
that ain't gonna make it.

This is the final party.

One final "screw you,"
putting all this cool shit

within arm's reach
and then not letting us do dick.

If you had to pick one wish they
would actually grant, what would it be?

Titties.

Never seen
a real girl's titties.

- Porn?
- Sure.

But never seen titties
in real life.

- You?
- Older sister.

Describe 'em.

Like titties, except their
your older sister's.

You don't really want
to keep looking at 'em.

Bed screeching

- How's that?
- Fine.

- You feeling me?
- Oh, I do.

What's my name?

Have you forgotten your name?

- Say it!
- It.

- My name.
- Jody.

Groans

Car horn blares

Knock at door

Hey, Molly.
It's me, Mandy.

Whoa.
Uh, this is Lip,

- my friend.
- Hey.

Is daddy here?

He's at sea,
but he sends his love.

How are you?

Am I coming home with you?

Um, Molly, did your mom--
did she have, like,

an address book
with family members

from her side of the family?

Cousins or anyone like that?

No.

Okay,
what about her cell phone?

Anyone on that?

She only had two numbers on it.

Daddy's and her dealer's.

You never met
any uncles or aunties?

Just you and my cousin David.

He's in the Navy
and fights bad guys.

But other than him, no.

Are you taking me to daddy?

Ooh, 51 seconds, Debs.

Only 39 seconds to go.

Inhales deeply

Hey, register two.

You having a party?

The ladies'll be
all a-flitter.

Hi.
Patty.

- Deli.
- Hey, Patty. Fiona.

Yeah, just a chance
to mingle away from work.

Coffee, cocktails,
conversation.

Totally casual.

I've been working here
25 years.

No one's ever thrown a party.

Well, it's good to get
to know people

away from the salt mine,
you know?

I don't know, but I'm glad
you're gonna show us.

Want me to bring something?

- We're all set.
- Are you sure?

Something from the deli?

Bobby'd probably give us
a discount.

Or I could throw away some meat

and pick it up
from the dumpster later.

Don't worry.
I'll double-bag it.

I'm just gonna do chips
and salsa, something light.

Well, more room
in my belly for beer.

See you tonight.

Panerai.
Nice.

How nice?

$2,000.

That cost me five
three years ago.

Don't need a pedigree.
Just need an answer.

Clicks tongue

Cell phone ringing

Fuck.

Okay, kids, for lunch,
we have organic chicken,

a fresh kale salad,

and a juice bar
with beets and cukes

and ginger and carrots
ready to be ground down

into their essential goodness.

- Got any chicken nuggets?
- I love chicken nuggets.

Chickie nugs?
I want some.

Sorry, guys.
No chicken nuggets.

- Got a car?
- No.

- I'm a college student.
- Buy one.

People who go to college
are rich.

- I'm not.
- Then go call us a cab

and go get us some nuggets.

I got money.
My mom said I could buy

whatever I want
from the camp store.

I want chicken nuggets.

There's no nuggets
at the camp store.

We're dying of cancer.

Serial killers on death row get
lobster for their final meal.

Any one of these next meals
could be our last.

We can't even get
some chicken nuggets?

We have cancer.

Go get us some nuggets now!

All: Nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets...
Other kids continue chanting

Hanley, I'm gonna get you
to see some real titties.

Not sister titties,
not porn titties.

Just naked, real titties.

Well, I'm off to work.

- Okay.
- Mwah.

Eggs are in the oven, Frank.

You were gonna talk to him.

I did.

Nothing's changed.

Not gonna happen overnight,
Sheila.

I am running out of time.

You're not.

I think we can have

what we had again.

And I would never
cheat on Jody,

but I am ready to ask him

if you and I can have
a little toy time on the side.

We had something special,

but not as special
as you and Jody.

I don't need Jody.
I need you.

Stammers
I-I need you back

because of what you let me feel

by allowing me
to make you feel something

that you don't want to feel.

You brought a girl to my house

without asking me first?

You took me in
when I needed it.

My MS has got real bad.

My whole left side
goes numb for weeks.

I'll help.

Your heart's
in the right place.

You're the best Milkovich
there is.

I should have called first.
I'm sorry.

No, it's not a bad idea, Mandy.

It's a bad time.

I mean, I can't take care
of little kids.

Take her back.

There are good people who work

in the places
that take care of orphans.

She'll be better off.

Could you look after her
while we figure it out?

What are you gonna do

when there's no Aunt Rande
to run to?

And one day, there won't be.

That day is today.

Loving sex
is a rule of my program.

Don't let your emotions
completely obscure

the barbaric roots
of the sexual act.

Don't lose touch with the seeds
of our animal nature.

That's a good thing.
We're not animals.

We're people with the ability

to elevate sex to a spiritual,
loving experience.

You can have that with Sheila

and still give her
what she needs.

That's not been my experience.

You're smarter now.

You're stronger.
You can handle it.

Sheila needs you.

 Boys will be boys

I love her, Frank.
I really do.

Then don't let past regrets

scare you from embracing
new experiences.

It's what it unleashes in me
that I'm afraid of.

Jody, the most important part
of your recovery

is this little family
you've started.

Sheila wants to be sensitive
to your recovery,

but she has needs.

Your acceptance of those needs

is an act of love.

This is love.

You're not breaking
your sobriety.

You're showing her
how much you care.

Hmm.

Ready, Jody.

Right.
What are we doing again?

"Eat at Anne's" with an arrow.

Cool.
Hop on.

Hey.
Where you been?

Hey.
Milwaukee.

- What?
- I love Milwaukee.

- Breweries.
- What's all this?

Party for work.

Hey, Fiona.

Fiona, this is Molly,

Mandy's sister.

Both: You have a sister?

I do.

Hey, Molly, bathroom.

You guys, I'm up to 75 seconds.

- Doing what, Debs?
- Prepping to be drowned

- at the city pool.
- Oh, cool.

Debs, this is Molly,
Mandy's sister.

Can you show her
the bathroom, please?

You have a sister?

Milwaukee?

Look, her mother OD'd,
and she called Mandy.

Uh-huh.
So why are you involved?

He's Captain Chivalry now.

Look, she's a little girl
that needs shelter

while we figure out
the next step.

Can't she just stay here
for a bit?

We're kind of full up.

Not with Carl in camp,
we're not.

Why don't you just take her
to her father's house?

Well, we're not gonna take her
to her father's house

because her father likes
to molest his daughters.

Should have led with that.

Sighs

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

So yes or no?

She can stay
till Carl gets back,

but, Lip, doing shit
like this signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

You sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Cell phone ringing Pop.

Can you meet me for a drink?

Is everything all right?

If everything was all right,

I wouldn't be asking you
to meet me

for a drink on short notice.

Can't you tell me on the phone?

James, just put on
your big-boy pants

and meet your father at a bar

of your choice
so we can mumble, like men,

over a beer.

Note rings out

No.

This is where they lock up
the pain pills.

- We need a bolt cutter.
- No, we don't.

Let's just use
your Swiss army knife

and unscrew the bolts.

Or we can just break the glass.

When I break the glass,
you guys cough

so no one will be suspicious.

One, two, three, cough.
All coughing

What are you kids
doing in here?

We were gonna steal the drugs
and sell them.

Really?
You need to work on your lying.

What do you need money for?

- We want to pay a woman--
- Shut up.

This is a camp that's supposed
to fulfill wishes,

but all you do is say "no."

Sighs

Kids, I came to work here

to do my part
in diminishing the burden

of your illness.

I know you've been disappointed

with some of the restrictions
put on you here.

I wish I had the power
to change that.

You may have more power
than you think.

Frank.

Jody wants to talk to you.

Lively conversation

Ladies, thanks
for getting together

on such short notice.

Oh, who doesn't like a party?

You've all embraced me
at the store,

and I really appreciate it.

And I-I just want to say

that we-- we collectively
have a voice.

All: Yeah!

And we-- we should
start voicing it.

You starting a ladies' choir?

I sing at the church
every Sunday.

I can't sing at all.

No. No.

Ladies, we need to speak
about what's going on at work--

with Bobby.

I, like all of you,

am happy to have a job, okay?

But I don't want this job

if the cost is
a never-ending payback hummer.

I don't want
to live in that world.

It's not right.

Thank God
somebody finally said it.

I've been saying it for months.

But you didn't throw a party.

Laughter

If we band together,

we can put an end to this.

- Yeah.
- An end to hearing your name

- called over the loudspeaker.
- Hello.

An end to him deciding

we're here to please him

whenever the urge arises.

- Right.
- An end to feeling

like we have to give him
whatever he wants.

Like we are
some desperate whores

who are happy
for the attention.

All: Right.

Our jobs are not his
to threaten us with.

- Right.
- Our mouths

are not his property
to use as he pleases.

- Yeah.
- Amen.

I was this close
to biting it off last week.

Laughter

We need to say this stops now.

All: Yeah!
Yes!

It's not that bad.
Silence

What?

I mean, he showers daily,

keeps himself clean.

Last year, when my kid got sick,
he gave me time off.

Says something.

Patty's right.

When I punch in late,
he never dock me.

What's a quick blow job
if, when my kid is sick,

I get to stay home?

- It's sexual harassment.
- Exactly.

He let me take flowers

to put on my mother's grave,
no charge.

He charges you a weekly hummer.

Come on, he lets you take home

week-old carnations
that are already dying.

To hell with his flowers.

It's once a week
for ten minutes.

Stick your finger up his rear

and pop his cork,
you get it done in two.

That's what I would do,

and leave a Lee press on nail
up there.

Laughter

Give him something
to scream about.

Amen, Jennica!
Laughter continues

We're playing
a dangerous game, ladies.

Okay?
Wait, wait.

If we cause a ruckus,
we get him fired,

guess what?

We don't know who
the next manager will be.

What if he doesn't let us
call in sick

when we're really not sick?

What if he doesn't let us
go to a funeral

without punching out?

What if he doesn't let us

take home expired meat
and sheet cakes

and a pony keg
once and again for free?

Bobby's a nice guy.

Okay, okay,
so we have to provide him

with oral pleasure once a week.

- Is that such a bad thing?
All: - Yes!

No, no, no, listen, girls, listen.
Think about it.

The dick we're sucking
may very well be better

than the dick we might have
to suck instead.

Thank God
you're in the minority.

All: Yeah.

- Uh, yeah?
All: - Yeah.

Let's take a vote.

On what?

The situation at hand.

Whether we keep
what's working working.

You want to have a vote?

Hey, you convened
the blow job town hall.

Let's vote.
Yes or no.

Fine.

Show of hands.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Secret ballot.

Let the democratic process
unfold.

Couple of tips...

don't relax.
Pretend you're scared.

She likes that.

I don't have
to pretend, though.

It'll stretch.
Trust me.

If God didn't want us
putting things up our ass,

he would have given the rectum
a gag reflex.

Laughter

So I was thinking
tonight maybe you and Molly

should sleep together.

I'll just bunk
with Ian and Liam.

That way, if she wakes up
in the middle

of the night
and she's freaking out,

- you'll be there.
- All right.

How long?

92 seconds!

Whoo!
Cheers

I'm only doing this for Hanley.

I have cancer too.

Me too.

You're the best friend
I've ever had.

Sighs

Sighs

Now how about the lower half?

Not happening, pal.

Wendy?

Wow.

Exactly how I imagined them
to be.

Okay.

Blow job.

No blow job.

Blow job.

Abstention?

Really, ladies?
One of you is abstaining?

What does that mean?

It means someone doesn't care

one way or another.

I never minded it,
but he never asks me anymore.

That's cause you're
a human piranha, Lois.

And blow jobs win,
six to three.

With one abstention.

That's what I'm talking about.

I want a recount.

Yeah, come on, ladies.

How could this many of you
vote for blow jobs?

Yeah, have the guts
to say who you are.

Patty's right.
It's not that bad.

Lucy, what about your blouse?

Oh, the stain came out.

Admit it, Fiona.
He doesn't taste that bad.

I wouldn't know.
I've never done it.

You're the reason why I had

to pick up an extra hummer
this week?

Pop.

James.

Um...

is this a place you frequent?

Yeah, neighborhood joint.
What's up?

Oh.

Um...

your mother and I

are getting a divorce.

Kev, shots, please.

Okay, I'll just be
down the hall.

You may hear some sirens
and stuff during the night,

but you'll be safe.

Okay, good night.

Good night.

Here you go.

Change of underwear
and a nightgown.

I'll be back
in a second, Molly.

Thanks.

Oh, yeah.
No worries.

Night.

Night.

I will totally teach you
to swim.

We could protect one other
from city kids

who hate white people.

Oh, yeah,
that's just my girl penis.

It looks exactly
like a boy penis.

But I'm a girl,

so it's different.

The incompatibility
finally caught up to us.

When you moving out?

Now, basically.

Basically?

Well, literally.

She, uh...

she changed the locks.

Hmm.

Where are you staying?

A hotel probably.

So how's mom?

Well...

she's fine.

Ah.
I'm being nice.

How's your mother?

Your mother,

she is on the final slope
downward

into the pickle jar.

A pill to rise,
a pill to sleep,

a pill to numb her
throughout the day,

and then Tanqueray
to wash it all down.

She changed the locks.

So be it.

Yeah.

And remember to breathe.

I don't want to do this.

Just keep reminding yourself,

this is love.

Say it with me.
"This is love."

- This is...
- Love.

Both: This is love.

- This is love.
- This is love.

- This is love.
- Exactly.

Okay, Sheils,
you're good to go.

Thanks, Frank.

This is love.

 You know
that you're pure lust



 every girl

 you're meeting

What? Wait, wait, wait, it's not my fault.
I was over-served, okay?

All right, let's just agree
to blame the bartender

and call it a night, okay?

What, you picking up
a little crack first?

This is where I live.

Clatter

Hey, Fiona,
Ian, you've met my father.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Whoa, whoa!
Ian, a little help here?

- Sure, sure.
- Hey, hey, hey.

Yeah, we were at the Alibi.

We had a few.

Well, I'll get a pillow
and a blanket.

All right.

Grunting

Sighs

This one's gonna take.

My boys are gonna hit
your bull's-eye.

- Mm.
- I can feel it.

Come on, boys!

Laughing Swim!

Swim like Michael Phelps!

Swim, baby!

Can a vagina go deaf?

Whoo!

Laughs

My parents
are getting divorced.

- I mean--
- Is that a good thing

- or a bad thing?
- I mean, now we have to spend

more time
with both of them, so...

not good.

Listen, I'm sorry
that I brought him here.

It was just, he was in a state,

and we were right around
the corner, and...

Chuckles

Let's end this day right.

 I spend my whole life
waiting

 for you to say you like

Liquid splashing

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's okay.
I'm done.

 I subjugate my soul

 but I make you feel
all right



 got a young man's libido

 and an old man's mind

 I want to kiss you all over

 I want to make you sweat

 I want to get
into your head

 'cause you're the one
I love

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

What the fuck?

Uh, I was looking
for the shower.

- Who the fuck are you?
- That's Jimmy's dad.

What's going on?
Oh.

Whoa, dad,
where's your clothes?

I was gonna take a shower.
I came into the wrong room.

Yeah, then you hopped up
in my bed with a full chub.

Both: - What?
- Jimmy's dad just tried to go

- balls-deep on me.
- No, man, I didn't--

Then why'd you grab my sack?

All right, cover up.

- Is everything all right?
- Doesn't seem to be.

- Uh, Molly, Debs, back to bed.
- Fuck.

Are you sure?

When you feel a full chub

poking you in the back,
the meaning's pretty clear.

Ned was looking for me.

I met him at a club.

We've been hooking up
for a while.

You've been screwing
Jimmy's dad?

I didn't know he
was Jimmy's dad at the time.

He's nice.

Yeah.

Is this why mom kicked you out?

What?

No.
No. No.

Does she know that you're...

gay?

I'm not so much gay as...

Sometimes I enjoy men
more than women, you know?

No, no, it's not that.

I-I'm broke, son.

Financially.

Broke.

That's why she threw me out.

That's...

not the only reason,

but most of it.

I'm sorry about in there.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

No, it was the wrong bed.

It's the other kid.

Ian.

I'll be at the Four Seasons.

I think I still have
a credit card that works.

I'm so sorry.

If I had to apologize
for all the stuff

my father's done,
I wouldn't have a voice left.

Mm.

Sobbing

They were really nice.

For all of you
who were too fucking busy,

this is what happened
last week on Shameless...

What the fuck you looking at?

This is my home.

I am an important part
of this family. Jesus!

No, you're not.
You don't live here anymore.

Catch. Open it.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Well, I sort of have a wife.

- She's always been a problem.
- No!

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When Immigration comes,
you will be her husband.

Beto's out front.
He follows me wherever I go.

He's harmless.

Ow! Fuck!

Daddy's good with babies.

Howdy, folks.
You need help with that baby?

I got a proposition
for you, Sheils.

Let me stay. You'll get
eight hours of sleep a night.

I can promise you that.

I know what I'm doing.

Are you supposed
to give Valium to a baby?

I lost $100 doing this night.

I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

The only way to make money
when you're poor

is to steal it or scam it.

I know. I know.
You want me to find Jesus.

I already found him.
Thanks.

I'm looking for Kev.

I'm his wife.

 what is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Upbeat music



Hey.

Hey.

You're awake.

Never fell asleep.

Sighs Just go talk to him.

It's not his fault
the crazy ex-wife

showed up out of nowhere.

She's no his ex,
she's his wife.

And you should've seen his face
when he saw her.

This house is so quiet.

Kids! Breakfast!

Jeez, Fiona.

This shit
is all in your head, V.

This house ain't quiet.

And she is not Kev's wife.
You are.

Go talk to him.

Baby crying

Groans

I need coffee.

We're out of filters.

We can use paper towels.

We're out of paper towels.

Diapers will work.

You have to go to work.

Yeah. Can we just reschedule
the doctor thing?

No, the vaccine schedule
is very important.

You can't be late.

How busy can a tattoo parlor be
in the morning?

Morning to us.

To some people, it's the end
of a long night.

Good morning.

No breakfast?

I haven't had a lot of energy
for shopping lately.

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

The Hymster and I will go
on a little field trip

to the grocery store.

We just need some cash,
right, buddy?

You still drunk, Frank?

Baby crying

Fine.

Oh, damn.
I got to go.

I'll grab coffee
on the way to work.

Boo-da-loo-boop.

Baby crying

Crying stops

I'm awake!

Baby crying Oh.

Go catch some Zs, Sheils.

- I got the little guy.
- I can't.

Hymie has his first
"Well Baby" appointment today

at the pediatrician.

Doctor require
some kind of co-pay

for this unnecessary visit?

Oh, of course he does.

Doctors are thieves,
little Hymster.

They just have degrees
to keep them out of jail.

Go on.
I'll take him.

Gasps You will?

- Yeah.
- Frank!

Oh, Frank, bless you.
Bless you.

Baby crying Bless you.

Oh. Okay.

- Here. Here.
- Okay.

- Here you go.
- That'll do it.

Ooh, look at that.

Oh, wait.
Don't you need the address?

- Where is she?
- She's still sleeping.

She did not just show up here
because her car broke down.

What do you think, V,
she broke it on purpose?

I think she broke you
on purpose.

She broke you.

And I put you back together.

And now she's here
to take back what I fixed.

V, look.
Look at this.

Divorce papers--
I got them off the internet.

This is my chance
to get her to sign it,

to make it official.

Why didn't you just say that
last night?

Because you were yelling
some shit about my face,

and then you ditched
and slept over at Fiona's.

Well, I was right
about your face.

Yawns

Good morning.

Hey.

I made you some coffee--

super strong, like you like it.

Yay, Kevy-caf, my fave.

"Kevy-caf"?

Decaf, full-caf, Kevy-caf--

for when you need
a real kick in the ass.

- Can I watch some TV?
- Yeah.

Gags

It's how she likes it.

Mmm.

Your bed is so comfy.
I slept like a baby.

You slept in our bed?

I stayed in the guest room.

Sighs God.

I haven't smelled that smell
in so long.

What smell?

His cologne...
on the pillow.

English Leather, like...

- Old man Carlyle used to wear.
- Old man Carlyle used to wear.

Giggles

"Old man Carlyle"?

Foster home where we met.

He was the best fake dad
we ever head.

You know
Junior's going to prison?

- Tax evasion.
- Junior Carlyle, no shit?

- No shit.
- No shit?

Six frozen OJs
for the price of five.

20% off mac and cheese,

and I have four of these.

Only one coupon per customer.

- It doesn't say that.
- It doesn't have to.

- It's implied.
- Hey, Tina.

It's time for your break.

Why don't you have Kim
take over your station?

Oh, my God.

- Is that snot?
- Sorry--

kids, summer colds.

I have four
mac and cheese coupons--

- I told you, one per customer.
- Hey, watch your tone.

I'll watch my tone
when you teach your kids

- how to use a kleenex.
- Excuse me?

I have four coupons!

I dug through
the neighbor's trash

- to get them!
- Tina, break time!

- Let's go.
- You know what? Fine!

Take it. Take all of it!
Take it for free!

I don't give a shit!

Do you hear me, Bobby?

I don't give a shit!

Take your own goddamn break!

And you can keep
my last paycheck.

I won't be coming back.

Keep taking this shit
if you want to.

But I'm out, bitches.
Out!

Why don't we just talk here
for a second, Tina.

Okay.

Maybe I shouldn't have pushed
so hard on the coupon thing.

Just, uh, stay here
and bag the groceries.

We didn't pay.

She said we could have 'em.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Are you the manager?

Uh, yes.
I'm so sorry

you had to hear
that kind of language

with your children present,
ma'am.

If you'd, uh, follow me back
to my office,

I'd be happy to give you
a coupon for a free ham.

That'd be great.

But it seems like
she kind of quit back there,

so I was thinking there
might be a job opening.

Hmm.
What's your name?

Fiona Gallagher.

You know what?

Why don't you follow me,
Fiona Gallagher?

So, right place,
right time, huh?

Hope so.

I'm responsible
and a really hard worker.

- You ever work as a cashier?
- Sure, absolutely.

So, tell me, Fiona,

how do you feel
about deli meats?

Deli meats?

I'm not big on olive loaf--

barfed it up once
when I was a kid.

- But mostly I like 'em.
- Good.

That's good.

I ask, because if you're gonna
be working here,

I got to see
how you handle the meat.

We sell franks and beans too.

We sell hot dogs, corn dogs,

three bean salad, cream cheese.

Chuckles Wow.

You're saying that if blow you,

I can have a job?

No.
I would never say that.

That would be inappropriate
and illegal.

If you wanted to blow me,

well, you'd have to be
a consenting adult.

Good morning, Frank.
Who's your handsome friend?

Chuckles
You hear that, Hymie?

That's Kate.
Kate's got good taste.

Give me a shot of JB,
a pickled egg,

and a thumbtack.

A thumbtack?

And a band-aid.

Baby crying

Trilling lips

There you go and--

mumps be gone.
Baby crying

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yeah, it's all over,
little buddy.

There you go.
There you go.

I'm gonna need
another one of these.

Um, I think I'm--
yeah.

I'm calling the police
and reporting child abuse.

Trills lips

AIDS didn't come
from the homos, Kate.

The gays may have helped
to spread it,

with their bloody
anal passions,

but it originated in vaccines

made from the blood
of African monkeys.

Interestingly enough,
heterosexual monkeys.

It was homos, Frank.
Chuckles

He needs his shots, Frank.

Jesus Christ, Kate.

The kid's already a half-wit.

You want to give him
autism too?

Now close your mouth

before someone considers it
an invitation,

and pour me a goddamn drink.

The stars came out

for the Wishing Lane Foundation
last night.

Adam Foster, ten years old,
and living

with a rare form leukemia,
had only one wish--

to meet his heroes, The Bulls.

They did better than that,
giving him courtside seats

and a ball
signed by the entire team.

Holy shit.
The whole team?

What do you think
that'd go for on eBay?

Couple grand, at least.

That kid's just got cancer.

Hymie's mentally deficient.

That's a permanent condition.

You should know, Frank.
Laughs

Trills lips

That would be an awesome job!

Discounts on groceries--

that could really help
with summer day care costs.

I'm not getting that job.

It's not gonna happen, so let's
just drop it, okay, Debs?

Debs?

Are you kidding me?

Get out of here,
you piece of shit!

You better run,
you sick bastard!

Hard rock music



You okay, Debs?

You shouldn't have to see that.

Can you describe the perp?

Red--
really, really red.

- What, like, sunburned?
- She's talking about his--

The guy, Debs.

What did the guy look like--
his face?

How are you supposed
to see his face

behind that giant,
red, one-eyed--

Got it. Okay.

You did great, miss.
Thank you.

Yeah, okay, come on, Debs.

Let's go get you a Bomb Pop
or something, huh?

- Why didn't you stab him?
- Stab him with what?

You ride the city bus
without a knife?

Scoffs

He was about 30, tallish,

long hair, long beard,
small dick...

you know, 'cause guys
with big ones

don't feel the need
to jerk it at little girls.

Okay.

- Uh, I'll file a report, but...
- But what?

Nobody cares
about a pervert on a bus?

We'll let the ITC know.

They'll keep an eye out
for the guy.

Thanks.

You did the right thing,
calling.

Here's my direct line,

if you need anything else.

Door opens, closes

- What?
- "You did the right thing.

- Here's my direct line."
- Please.

You have less
to worry about from him

than from the manager
at the grocery store.

Am I supposed to find comfort
in that sentence?

Dude wanted a blow
in exchange for a job,

giving new meaning
to "blow job."

Wow?

You grow up in this house,

you think that nothing
can shock you anymore.

And then--

what is it with men
and their johnsons--

shaking them on buses,

using them to blackmail
potential employees?

You know, that was probably
a good job too--

benefits,
discounts on groceries.

Sighs

You know what?

He doesn't get away
with this shit.

- I'm going back over there.
- Great.

You want me to come with you?

No, but can you watch Liam?

Oh, shit.
Sorry, I can't.

You just offered
to come with me.

No, I know,
because I knew you'd say no.

I got a checkup.

Sighs

Kick ass, take names.

Don't blow anyone.

You let her sleep in our bed?

You said yourself
she's a crazy bitch.

She is a crazy bitch.

And not a crazy bitch
like you're a crazy bitch,

like, "oh, bitch,
you so crazy." No!

She once tried to beat me
to death with a frozen fish

because I had asked
if there was more broccoli.

And you never know
what's gonna set her off.

What are you doing?
Put that back on.

I'm changing.
Cell phone rings

Teresa will be here
at 2:00.

- Who's that?
- Notary public,

gets her hair done
at mom's salon.

So you have until 2:00 to get
the divorce papers signed,

or I'll show her
who's a crazy bitch.

- Hey.
- Put your shirt on.

Put your shirt on!

Hey, I'm changing.

I'm gonna go take a look
at your car.

- Okay.
- On that foot?

I can handle it.

If you can handle it,
maybe you can handle

the dripping faucet
in our bathroom.

- How'd you do that anyway?
- Shootin' hoop.

I snapped my achilles
posting up some local kid--

he's huge. He's probably gonna
go in the NBA draft next year.

He snapped it
falling in the bathtub

like an old Florida Jew.

Laughs
Which was right after the game.

It was a delayed reaction.

Hey, V, you still have
that mini camera

you use for titty shots?

I need your help with a scumbag
at the grocery store.

- Hey, I'm--
- I know who you are.

Chuckles V, why don't you
go help Fiona at the store?

And while you're there,
see if there's

some more broccoli.

Fine. Come on.

Teresa, here, 2:00.

Holy shit.

A lot of red dots.

All those red dots
are sex offenders

in our neighborhood?

All right, check this out.

Child rapist three blocks over,

did five years
and out on probation.

How does a child rapist
only get five years?

He doesn't--
he gets five years,

plus the beating of this life.
Let's go.

I thought
we were gonna fix the pool.

No, no, no,
you should come, Carl.

- Grab the bat.
- Awesome.

Hey, you want help?

My dad always loves
a good perv posse.

So we're just forgetting
about the guy on the bus?

Hell, no, I'm gonna
teach you self-defense--

Milkovich style.
Come on.

All right, let's go.

Yo, we're going
to jump a pedophile.

- You want to come?
- Aw, sounds great.

But I can't.

You're acting cagey, okay?

And there's been
an Escalade parked

across the street
for longer than makes sense.

What's going on?

I don't want to know?

'Cause if you told me,
I'd have to tell Fiona,

which would upset
the delicate peace

we've recently established?

Right.

Have fun
wailing on the pedophile.

Is there any way not to?

Thank you.

No, thank you, Marta.
Thank you.

- Now you stay strong.
- Come on, baby.

Hello.
May I help you?

I hope so.
I'm Frank Gallagher.

May I start by saying thank you

for all you do
for our suffering little ones.

Thank you, Mr. Gallagher.

This is my son Hymie.

He was born
with an extra chromosome,

through no fault of his own--
Down Syndrome.

It's a lifelong condition.
It's irreversible.

He's a beautiful boy.

Aren't you, Hymie?
Yes, you are.

And believe it or not,
he is already,

at such a young age,
an avid sports fan.

Is that so?

He can watch a ball dribble

up and down a court for hours,

endlessly fascinated.

His little face
just lights up with joy.

It would be so wonderful

if he could see it
all happen in real life.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher.

I-I think
you may be confused.

Our organization
works with dying children,

not children with Down's.

Of course.

Of course.
I know that.

Crying

It's my other child
that's dying.

Sobs Oh, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Blows nose, sobs

Drive.

Chuckles

What the fuck you want?

Convicted child rapist

just moved in down the street.

Let's get the boys.

Rock music



What the fuck
is this little parade?

Kid fucker, next block.

Knock at door

May I help you?

We're looking
for Blake Collins.

Sighs I am Blake Collins.

Oh, shit.

You're the eighth-grade teacher
who screwed her student, right?

You were on TV.

I didn't "screw" William.
I loved him.

And I did my time.
I paid for my mistake--

if love can be called
a mistake.

Sighs I'm sure
there are real criminals

in the the neighborhood
that you can beat up

if you have the inclination.

Now, please,
may I close the door?

Yeah, yeah.

Door closes

Shit.

Let's go find a camel jockey.

Yo, Carl, get home, all right?

Shit, we should still
do something.

You thinking gang bang?

Uh, no,
but she fucks little kids.

It was one kid,
and he wasn't that little.

Look, he was 14.
She was his teacher.

Do we really want a pedophile
living in the neighborhood?

Shit, if it was 14
and had a teacher

who looked like that
and wanted it?

Man, I'm getting wood
just thinking about that.

Yo, Angie?

Yeah?

You want to fuck?

Sure.

Now, see, I thought
you two were, uh...

Shut up.

Hope you're using a raincoat.

You were having sex at 14.

I was having sex
with a 14-year-old at 14.

So you think Kash
should have gone to jail?

Yeah, I do.

I almost called
the cops 100 times.

Should've--
creepy fucking Arab dude

- fucking my little brother.
- I was 15.

I was old enough
to make my own decisions.

You were a kid.
He was a man.

Says you.

You really want this chick
living in the neighborhood?

Think about Carl.

- Carl should be so lucky.
- Okay.

So what if it was Debbie
and a 30-year-old dude?

- Ugh, it's different.
- Bullshit it's different.

Look, she's not hanging around
the park with lollipops.

She fell in love.

It's got nothing to do
with love.

This chick
is a standard-issue pedophile,

and I'm gonna prove it.

Shouting in portuguese _

- Sorry I'm late.
- I hate this INS bullshit.

America is supposed to be
free country, no?

No.

Hey!
That's a nice outfit.

It's not an outfit.
It's a perv trap.

What, is that like
a bear trap--

where your titties
clamp around the wrist

and they have to gnaw off
their own paws?

Both laugh
2:00.

I got it.

She hates me, doesn't she?

No. She just
don't know you yet.

I mean, I get it-- I would hate
me, too, if I were her.

I mean, I show up here
with my kid in tow,

and you haven't seen me
in years.

It's almost like I'm trying
to get you back or something.

But honestly, Kev, I don't even
know if Kyle's yours.

I was really getting around
back then.

So V has nothing
to worry about.

What?
What'd I say?

You think Kyle could be mine?

You didn't do that math?

Shit. Sorry.

Cancer?

How did I get cancer?

You must have caught it
from grammy, son.

If she had known that she had
the contagious kind,

I don't think she would've spent
so much time

with you in the basement,
cooking meth.

Am I going to die?

I hope not.

But right now we have to fight

and fight hard.

You ready to fight
with me, Carl?

Razor whirring

Why do we have to shave it?

Didn't you ever see any shows
about cancer?

Cancer people are always bald.

Grammy wasn't bald.

Grammy hated life.

She wanted to die,
but you love life.

And one
of the most important ways

you can fight the cancer

is to let the sunrays
in through your skull.

Why are you shaving
Carl's head?

Lice.

Since when do you...

parent?

Since you dropped the ball.

The vermin were literally
jumping off his scalp.

Well, make sure
you wash the sheets too, okay?

I look like a woman?

I have lice too?

Yes.
Yes, you do.

Fiona's gonna freak out.

No, Fiona is not
going to freak out,

because Fiona
is not going to know.

You're a man now, Carl.

The cancer makes you a man.

And as a man, it's your job

to keep secrets
from the women who love you.

Jeez, I'm gonna
look like a penis.

Razor stops whirring

I'll get you a hat.

I'll get you a hat.
Razor whirring

Knock at door

- Yes?
- Hi. Uh, how you doing?

I'm-- I'm Lip,
uh, short for Phillip.

I-I just live right over
on 64th.

I'm gonna be a sophomore
next year at Lincoln.

Um, I was walking by your yard,

and it looks pretty overgrown.

I was wondering, um...

can I trim your hedges?

Like, five bucks an hour?

Scoffs
May I trim your hedges?

Oh, right, yeah, sorry.

Um, may I trim your hedges?

Upbeat music



Yeah.

Yeah, it's good.
It's good.

- We're good.
- No!

No, we're just taking fake
wedding pictures for the INS.

No one's gonna see you
in that dress.

The INS will see me!

And if I look like cow,
they will know it fake!

And I will get deported for sure!

And you will go to prison.
Speaking portuguese _

- She's your wife.
- No.

You married her before God, no?

No, I married her
before her father,

who had a gun
pointed at my nuts.

It's different, somehow.

Buy something.

89 cents.

I-I don't get it.

Take the cup out of the trash.

Oh, the stuff's in it!

Just get out.

You need whatever
brain cells you got left.

Why you got to mess
with my business, man?

Why you got to do
your business in my store?

It's not your store.
It's towelhead's store.

- Whatever--
get smarter customers,

'cause I'm not going down
for this shit.

Oh, okay.

So, uh, what you
going down for, then, huh?

Hey, did you really fuck
Angie Zahgo today?

Yeah, I fucked Angie.
Everybody fucks Angie.

You don't fuck Angie?

No.

Huh.
You want to fuck Angie?

I can call her,
get her down here.

No.

What's your business here?

I may or may not be related

Oh.

Okay. Sorry.

I'm Debbie Gallagher.

Any idea where
I can get a smoke?

 in the garden of Eden

 Adam-- he said to Eve

 "girl, get away
from that tree

 or the lord might punish me

 that's just
what I have to believe"

Finished already?

Yeah, not quite.
Um, I'm just--

I'm really hot.

Um, could I bother you
for something to drink?

A juice box?

Yes, please.

Uh...

just wait here.

 you know it ain't no chore

 when you're working,
working for the Lord

Hi.

Uh, I-I told you
to wait out there.

Yeah, so sorry.
I just, um--

I wondered if I could bother you
for a sandwich too?

You know, I ain't had lunch.

You haven't had lunch.

"Ain't" isn't a word, Phillip.

Right.

Hey, um, are you a teacher?

Scoffs
I-I used to be.

Oh, I bet you were a good one.

Inhales deeply, stammers
What kind of sandwich?

PB and J?

With the crust cut off?

Yes, please.

And you should've heard her
going on and on

about Kev's cologne and
Old man Johnson, or some shit--

anything she could talk about
that I wouldn't know about.

He's right in there.
You know what you're doing?

Do I know how to make a man
ask me for a hummer?

Wait here.

Sighs

Mm, he was born March 2001.

Weren't we together?

No, remember?
We split up that year.

Got back together after 9/11.

Why did we break up, again?

Oh, yeah.

You tried to run me over
with your car.

Giggles

Yeah, I don't remember
that being funny.

It was fucking scary.

Well, as it turns out,
it was the pregnancy hormones.

You were knocked up.

So he is mine?

I don't know, Kev.
Sighs

We were off and on that year.
There were other guys.

When you left me,

I didn't think
I could raise him on my own.

So I gave him
to my sister Crystal,

'cause she always wanted a kid.

Now she's going through
some shit,

needed me to take him.

And we thought it was time
you knew the truth.

You thought it was time?

You didn't think
it might have been time

at any other point
in the 12 years

- this kid's been alive?
- I'm really sorry, Kev.

You're sorry?
12 years, Cheryl.

You left me!

If there was a chance
that he could've been mine,

you should've told me
about him.

And did I tell you she called
her coffee "Kevy-caf"?

Like a pet name, like they have

some secret language
that I don't speak.

- V, what happened?
- Oh.

Corn dogs, cream cheese,
I got it all on tape.

- He's nasty.
- Right?

Go.
He's waitin' on you.

I want day shifts,
home by 6:00.

Couldn't help but notice
your wedding ring, Bobby.

You want your wife
to see this tape?

Fine. Days.

Just fill this out.

And we'll be taking
some veal cutlets

for our troubles--

actual veal cutlets,

none of your skanky deli meats.

Upbeat music



Go, go, go, go, go.

Speaking portuguese _

Gasps

That is terrible ugly dress.

Your friend, she must not
like you very much.

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

Mmm.

Um, you have a little, uh...

Oh.
Clears throat

Mm.
Chuckles

Oh, no, uh, the other--
the other--

Mm.

Did I get it?

No.

You know, um, can you help me?

How old are you really,
Phillip?

16...

almost.

Sighs

But I've always felt
like an old soul.

Mm.

Oh! Ah.
You-- you mustn't tell anyone.

No, no.
I won't. I won't.

I-I promise you,
just--

you're such a good teacher,
I feel like

I-I got so much
to learn from you.

Have-- you have so much
to learn.

- I do.
- You do. Oh.

Mm, I got to go.

- Go?
- Yeah, homework.

- In the summer?
- Mm.

- Oh, shit.
- Don't go, Phillip.

- I have more to teach you.
- Uh-huh.

- Come with me, Phillip.
- I, uh--

Shh. Don't worry.
Don't be scared, okay?

I'll teach you.

Grunts

Are you coming, Phillip?

Uh, yeah--
yes, I'm coming.

Phone beeping
Bring the peanut butter!

Rock music



Nice place you got here.

What are you doing here?

I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips

and a ginger snap, I'm hoping.

Keep the change.

I'm working.

Well, maybe later.

Happy hour at The Fountain?

Yeah, okay.

Okay.

You got a receipt?

Receipt printing

That your grandpa?

Nah, just a guy
I've been seeing.

Oh, that's the guy
you've been, uh--

you've been seeing?

You guys, like,
picnic together, or, uh...

you gonna get a little dog
with a fucking sweater?

Nah, we don't picnic.
We mostly just fuck...

like you and Angie.

That image--

it's, like, scorched
behind my eyes--

a fire-breathing
one-eyed dragon.

You don't have to smoke,
you know.

It's cooler if you don't.

- Really?
- Everyone smokes.

You're only a rebel
if you don't.

Have you ever seen one
in real life...

like, on a grown-up,
when it's...

like that?

Yeah, I watch lots of porn.

It's way different in real life

than those sketches they show
you in health class, right?

What's Kev like?

Is he cool, or is he batshit
like everyone else in my family?

No, Kev's cool, nice...

like you.

I think I may become a nun.

Nuns don't have sex, right?

You're pretty--

too pretty to be a nun.

Hey, T!
What's up, girl?

You look skinny.

Don't come down here
sweet-talking me, V.

I've been sitting here waiting
for almost an hour.

What?
Kev never showed up?

No. Nobody's here
to sign anything.

And nobody's here
to pay me my money.

And I sure as shit
didn't cart my ass

all the way down here for free.

Hey, you, kid!

Where's your mother?

She and Kev
went to go get a drink.

He was freaking out
about the whole kid thing.

What whole kid thing?

About how I may be Kev's kid.

Debs, be home for dinner.

- I will.
- V?

Veronica, where's my $40?

Here, here, I got it.

Here you go.

Hi.

Am I-- am I gonna get
as sick as them?

Coughs

Only time will tell.

The good news is,
the cancer's in your brain.

And you never were
much of a thinker,

so it probably
won't affect you that much.

Oh, God.
Oh, God!

Wait, wait.

You need to learn to wait,
Phillip, okay?

- No, why-- why--
- Just hold it back.

- I'll get hard again quick,
I-I promise.

No, it gets better
if you delay the gratification.

The joy-- it's even bigger.
Just wait, okay?

Okay, that's--
wow.

That's really fucking good.

What is that?
What is that?

That tingles.
What is that--

some kind
of sex cream or something?

Giggles It's, uh...

it's-- oh, God.

- I don't think I can wait.
- No, no, no.

You can do it, Phillip.

You are my A-plus student.

- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, breathe deeper.

- Mm.
- Slowly.

- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Slowly.

Slow.

Okay?

- Okay.
- Good.

What's, uh--
what-- what's that?

That's, um--
ah, that's weird.

Giggles
Yeah, that's--

that's cold.
What-- what is that?

Well, you trimmed my hedges,

and now I am trimming yours.

Wait, what--
what is that, fucking nair?

You're fresh and clean now,

- just like a baby, Phillip.
- Wait, no, what--

oh, shit.

You said you catered
to dying children.

Sir, The Bulls only give us
so many packages per season

- and it takes months.
- Ow!

What the fuck, Frank?

That's going on
all day, every day.

My son is suffering.

Have you no soul?

If you fill out
an application now,

I can almost guarantee
that for next year--

He doesn't have a year!

Whimpers

There's a camp.

All the spots are full,
but there's a quadriplegic.

He won't get much out of it.

I can bump him for Carl.

Camp?

Like summer camp?

It's beautiful,
on a lake--

a wonderful place
for children to feel normal

one last time.

What the hell am I supposed to
do with a trip to cancer camp?

I've never been to camp.

Baby crying

Jimmy, come sit with me.
I want to show you something.

Come!

Hey.

All of this
romantic pretending, amor,

it make me so hot...

and wet.

Ow.

- Feel.
- Ow.

We should not put
all that water to waste, no?

- No?
- No.

- Ow.
- No.

Este, Este, listen.

- I-I--
- Yes?

- I-I can't.
- Yes.

- I-I--
- Yes!

- I can't.
- Yes!

No.
I can't!

Moans

- I-- no, I can't.
- Yes!

- Oh, fuck!
- Yes! Moans

Indistinct conversation

All right,
what are we gonna do?

- Whose ass am I kicking first?
- There's no ass to kick.

Kev's a little boy with
a "white picket fence" fantasy,

and in walks his wife
with his son.

We don't know that's his kid.

So first thing we do
is get a paternity test.

It's not about blood to Kev.

There's a woman
he grew up with and married

saying her son is his.

- That's stupid.
- It's not. Look at you.

You're a mother to your kids.

Doesn't matter
you didn't push them out.

Kev's the first good man
I've ever loved, you know?

My first love was
named Apollo, enough said.

Then there was Spider.

Laughs Spider?

You can't make that shit up.

No, I...

I can't fight for Kev.

Asking him to pick me over them

is asking him to change
the thing about him

that I love the most.

Screw that.

- Fi...
- No.

- Screw that.
- Fiona.

Sit-- Fi!

- Good catch.
- Kev!

- What the fuck?
- There's kids around.

Oh, you think
they haven't heard it before?

- What, are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

I'm out of my mind,
'cause you and V

are the only things
that have ever made sense

to me in this
whole fucked up world.

Okay, if you guys
can't make it,

Jimmy and I should
just quit right now.

I swear to God,
if you leave V--

- Who's leaving V?
- You're leaving V?

No.
Fiona, what the hell?

The notary, Kev,
the divorce papers?

Oh!

Shit. I had some drinks.

And Cheryl
dropped this kid bomb, and--

- and I forgot.
- Hey!

- You're interrupting.
- Excuse me?

Kev's trying
to get to know his son.

Give my boys their time.

- Your boys?
- No, no, Fiona.

It's not--
it's not what you think.

Look, Cheryl and I
have history-- that's it.

And she's not trying
to steal me away from V.

She just wants me
to meet my son.

I know school
was never your thing,

but you've never been dumb.

If you don't see
what happening here,

just plain dumb.

Come on, Debs, dinnertime.

- Can Kyle come?
- No.

All right.

You know, my mother,

she reminds me very much
of your Fiona--

beautiful, raised six kids,
never complained, a saint.

My father, he was a...

Speaking portuguese _

- A rolling stone.
- She put my hand there.

I didn't even move it.

That is something exactly
like my father would have said.

Did that fatty
actually cop a feel?

He totally copped a feel.

Laughs
You got to be kidding me.

I mean, what's up with that?

Shit, Mickey.
What the hell you doing here?

Ah, from the store, right?

Oh, come on, Ian,
don't be rude.

Invite your boyfriend
back to my place.

I mean, the more
the merrier, right?

Chuckles I'm sorry.

- What'd you call me?
- What?

Oh, Jesus, Mickey!

Faggot.

What the fuck
did you call me, faggot?

Enough. Enough!

Horn honking

- What the fuck, Gallagher?
- Shit, Mickey.

They're gonna call the cops.

- Are you okay?
- Come on!

- Sorry.
- Gallagher!

Sorry.
I'll text you.

Ah, shit!

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

Laughs

Both laughing

Where'd you learn this?

Nowhere.
Just relax and enjoy.

You been watching porn
without me?

'Cause, you know,
I consider that cheating.

No, I haven't,

although I do consider
that rule pretty unrealistic.

I just thought it up.

It's hot, right?

Maybe if I was licking it
off you.

I'm hungry.
Trade places.

- No.
- No?

Chuckles Since when
do you turn down a BJ?

Your dick's not even hard.

What?
I did a little manscaping.

Shit.

It's not my fault, okay?

What-- she's a pedophile!

Look, it was a sting operation.

Look, I took a picture
for the cops.

Fuck the cops.
They had their chance.

Shit.

Sighs

- Smells good.
- What's with Mandy?

Ah, something she wanted to do.

- Where's Jimmy?
- No idea.

What happened
to your head, Carl?

- Lice.
- Again?

Yeah, Frank shaved it.

Yeah, and he got me
into a summer camp.

What?
Why would he do that?

I don't know.
But it's cool, right?

Yeah, it's awesome, Carl.

Sighs

Door closes

I'm gonna know my kid.

I'm gonna know my kid,

and you can't have
a problem with that.

Look, I...

I don't care about Cheryl, V.

I used to, but she's nothing
but a memory to me now.

And I'm sorry...

Sighs
I didn't go see the notary.

But I would
never leave you, ever.

You got to know that.

After everything
we've been through,

you kind of just have
to know that.

Sobs

Whoa. You just snotted
the whole table.

Laughter

Kev?

Kev.

Laughter

What?
What the fuck?

Are they laughing at me?

- No.
- Yes.

- Fiona!
- Fuck you!

- Excuse you?
- Cheryl, listen--

No, I'm done listening.
Kyle, go pack our shit, now.

Cheryl, would you just
listen to me?

You could've had this,
and you want that?

She's some kind of nympho,

has three drawers
full of dildos.

What you doing going through
my shit, bitch?

What's a dildo?

Cheryl, would you just listen?

You're just as thick
as the day I met you.

Cheryl, I get that you're mad,

but I want to be
a father to Kyle.

Now, I'm gonna get you
a place nearby.

He's not yours, Kev.
He isn't even mine.

He's my sister's,
you stupid piece of shit!

What did she say?

What did she say?

- What the fuck, bitch?
- Get her, V!

I'll fuck you up!

Screams

Well, should we
stop 'em, or--?

What, you want to lose an eye?

- Aah!
- You're a crazy bitch!

- Kill her, V!
- Aah!

Bitch, you come into my house

and make up
some shit like that?

Get your hands off me,
you dirty bitch!

Screams Get her off me!

- Shit, the TV!
- No!

Not the TV!

Get the divorce papers, Kev.

- This bitch is about to sign.
- I ain't signing shit!

This way, this way.
Screams

If you want to walk away
with four limbs, bitch,

you're gonna sign.
Kev, the papers!

- Fuck you!
- You're signing!

Snap Aah!

- Sign the papers.
- Aah!

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Screams

Sign it!

You could initial that.

Grunts, panting

Uh-uh, not one word.
Just drive away.

Tires squeal

Whoo.

Bitch, you so crazy.

Hell, yeah!

All cheering

Hell, yeah!

You're still here.

You think I'm getting in a car
with that psycho?

Hey, uh,
can I borrow your phone?

I need to call my mom--
my other mom.

Sure.

You want to eat dinner first?

- Sure.
- Cool.

Knock at door

- You Blake?
- Shakily Yes.

You're moving now, Blake.

- You're moving tonight.
- Excuse me?

I don't excuse you,
you sick bitch.

I don't excuse you
'cause you're hot

or 'cause you're blonde
or 'cause

of what you've got
between your legs.

Come take a look.

You see that?

They're digging your grave.

And you want to be gone before
they get down to six feet.

- How's it going, boys?
- Good.

We dug the Berlanti grave
in what, two hours?

But this dirt
is nice and soft--

- going a lot faster.
- Ticktock.

Kid fucker.

Sighs deeply

- Hey.
- Hey.

You looked stressed.

I do?

- How was your day?
- Good.

How'd it go at the doctor?

Good.
It's healing.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Crying

The world's messed up.

So much ugly shit happens.

I don't know.
Kev and V and--

I trust you.

That's bigger to me
than "I love you."

It's a bigger deal.

I trust you.

 I want to be happy for you

 I don't wanna be petty

No reason to waste
a perfectly good grave.

 I'm searching
for my place in the sun

 I'm reaching out for warm





For all of you
who were too fucking busy,

this is what happened
last week on Shameless...

What the fuck you looking at?

This is my home.

I am an important part
of this family. Jesus!

No, you're not.
You don't live here anymore.

Catch. Open it.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Well, I sort of have a wife.

- She's always been a problem.
- No!

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When Immigration comes,
you will be her husband.

Beto's out front.
He follows me wherever I go.

He's harmless.

Ow! Fuck!

Daddy's good with babies.

Howdy, folks.
You need help with that baby?

I got a proposition
for you, Sheils.

Let me stay. You'll get
eight hours of sleep a night.

I can promise you that.

I know what I'm doing.

Are you supposed
to give Valium to a baby?

I lost $100 doing this night.

I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

The only way to make money
when you're poor

is to steal it or scam it.

I know. I know.
You want me to find Jesus.

I already found him.
Thanks.

I'm looking for Kev.

I'm his wife.

Upbeat music



Hey.

Hey.

You're awake.

Never fell asleep.

Sighs Just go talk to him.

It's not his fault
the crazy ex-wife

showed up out of nowhere.

She's no his ex,
she's his wife.

And you should've seen his face
when he saw her.

This house is so quiet.

Kids! Breakfast!

Jeez, Fiona.

This shit
is all in your head, V.

This house ain't quiet.

And she is not Kev's wife.
You are.

Go talk to him.

Baby crying

Groans

I need coffee.

We're out of filters.

We can use paper towels.

We're out of paper towels.

Diapers will work.

You have to go to work.

Yeah. Can we just reschedule
the doctor thing?

No, the vaccine schedule
is very important.

You can't be late.

How busy can a tattoo parlor be
in the morning?

Morning to us.

To some people, it's the end
of a long night.

Good morning.

No breakfast?

I haven't had a lot of energy
for shopping lately.

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

The Hymster and I will go
on a little field trip

to the grocery store.

We just need some cash,
right, buddy?

You still drunk, Frank?

Baby crying

Fine.

Oh, damn.
I got to go.

I'll grab coffee
on the way to work.

Boo-da-loo-boop.

Baby crying

Crying stops

I'm awake!

Baby crying Oh.

Go catch some Zs, Sheils.

- I got the little guy.
- I can't.

Hymie has his first
"Well Baby" appointment today

at the pediatrician.

Doctor require
some kind of co-pay

for this unnecessary visit?

Oh, of course he does.

Doctors are thieves,
little Hymster.

They just have degrees
to keep them out of jail.

Go on.
I'll take him.

Gasps You will?

- Yeah.
- Frank!

Oh, Frank, bless you.
Bless you.

Baby crying Bless you.

Oh. Okay.

- Here. Here.
- Okay.

- Here you go.
- That'll do it.

Ooh, look at that.

Oh, wait.
Don't you need the address?

- Where is she?
- She's still sleeping.

She did not just show up here
because her car broke down.

What do you think, V,
she broke it on purpose?

I think she broke you
on purpose.

She broke you.

And I put you back together.

And now she's here
to take back what I fixed.

V, look.
Look at this.

Divorce papers--
I got them off the internet.

This is my chance
to get her to sign it,

to make it official.

Why didn't you just say that
last night?

Because you were yelling
some shit about my face,

and then you ditched
and slept over at Fiona's.

Well, I was right
about your face.

Yawns

Good morning.

Hey.

I made you some coffee--

super strong, like you like it.

Yay, Kevy-caf, my fave.

"Kevy-caf"?

Decaf, full-caf, Kevy-caf--

for when you need
a real kick in the ass.

- Can I watch some TV?
- Yeah.

Gags

It's how she likes it.

Mmm.

Your bed is so comfy.
I slept like a baby.

You slept in our bed?

I stayed in the guest room.

Sighs God.

I haven't smelled that smell
in so long.

What smell?

His cologne...
on the pillow.

English Leather, like...

- Old man Carlyle used to wear.
- Old man Carlyle used to wear.

Giggles

"Old man Carlyle"?

Foster home where we met.

He was the best fake dad
we ever head.

You know
Junior's going to prison?

- Tax evasion.
- Junior Carlyle, no shit?

- No shit.
- No shit?

Six frozen OJs
for the price of five.

20% off mac and cheese,

and I have four of these.

Only one coupon per customer.

- It doesn't say that.
- It doesn't have to.

- It's implied.
- Hey, Tina.

It's time for your break.

Why don't you have Kim
take over your station?

Oh, my God.

- Is that snot?
- Sorry--

kids, summer colds.

I have four
mac and cheese coupons--

- I told you, one per customer.
- Hey, watch your tone.

I'll watch my tone
when you teach your kids

- how to use a kleenex.
- Excuse me?

I have four coupons!

I dug through
the neighbor's trash

- to get them!
- Tina, break time!

- Let's go.
- You know what? Fine!

Take it. Take all of it!
Take it for free!

I don't give a shit!

Do you hear me, Bobby?

I don't give a shit!

Take your own goddamn break!

And you can keep
my last paycheck.

I won't be coming back.

Keep taking this shit
if you want to.

But I'm out, bitches.
Out!

Why don't we just talk here
for a second, Tina.

Okay.

Maybe I shouldn't have pushed
so hard on the coupon thing.

Just, uh, stay here
and bag the groceries.

We didn't pay.

She said we could have 'em.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Are you the manager?

Uh, yes.
I'm so sorry

you had to hear
that kind of language

with your children present,
ma'am.

If you'd, uh, follow me back
to my office,

I'd be happy to give you
a coupon for a free ham.

That'd be great.

But it seems like
she kind of quit back there,

so I was thinking there
might be a job opening.

Hmm.
What's your name?

Fiona Gallagher.

You know what?

Why don't you follow me,
Fiona Gallagher?

So, right place,
right time, huh?

Hope so.

I'm responsible
and a really hard worker.

- You ever work as a cashier?
- Sure, absolutely.

So, tell me, Fiona,

how do you feel
about deli meats?

Deli meats?

I'm not big on olive loaf--

barfed it up once
when I was a kid.

- But mostly I like 'em.
- Good.

That's good.

I ask, because if you're gonna
be working here,

I got to see
how you handle the meat.

We sell franks and beans too.

We sell hot dogs, corn dogs,

three bean salad, cream cheese.

Chuckles Wow.

You're saying that if blow you,

I can have a job?

No.
I would never say that.

That would be inappropriate
and illegal.

If you wanted to blow me,

well, you'd have to be
a consenting adult.

Good morning, Frank.
Who's your handsome friend?

Chuckles
You hear that, Hymie?

That's Kate.
Kate's got good taste.

Give me a shot of JB,
a pickled egg,

and a thumbtack.

A thumbtack?

And a band-aid.

Baby crying

Trilling lips

There you go and--

mumps be gone.
Baby crying

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yeah, it's all over,
little buddy.

There you go.
There you go.

I'm gonna need
another one of these.

Um, I think I'm--
yeah.

I'm calling the police
and reporting child abuse.

Trills lips

AIDS didn't come
from the homos, Kate.

The gays may have helped
to spread it,

with their bloody
anal passions,

but it originated in vaccines

made from the blood
of African monkeys.

Interestingly enough,
heterosexual monkeys.

It was homos, Frank.
Chuckles

He needs his shots, Frank.

Jesus Christ, Kate.

The kid's already a half-wit.

You want to give him
autism too?

Now close your mouth

before someone considers it
an invitation,

and pour me a goddamn drink.

The stars came out

for the Wishing Lane Foundation
last night.

Adam Foster, ten years old,
and living

with a rare form leukemia,
had only one wish--

to meet his heroes, The Bulls.

They did better than that,
giving him courtside seats

and a ball
signed by the entire team.

Holy shit.
The whole team?

What do you think
that'd go for on eBay?

Couple grand, at least.

That kid's just got cancer.

Hymie's mentally deficient.

That's a permanent condition.

You should know, Frank.
Laughs

Trills lips

That would be an awesome job!

Discounts on groceries--

that could really help
with summer day care costs.

I'm not getting that job.

It's not gonna happen, so let's
just drop it, okay, Debs?

Debs?

Are you kidding me?

Get out of here,
you piece of shit!

You better run,
you sick bastard!

Hard rock music



You okay, Debs?

You shouldn't have to see that.

Can you describe the perp?

Red--
really, really red.

- What, like, sunburned?
- She's talking about his--

The guy, Debs.

What did the guy look like--
his face?

How are you supposed
to see his face

behind that giant,
red, one-eyed--

Got it. Okay.

You did great, miss.
Thank you.

Yeah, okay, come on, Debs.

Let's go get you a Bomb Pop
or something, huh?

- Why didn't you stab him?
- Stab him with what?

You ride the city bus
without a knife?

Scoffs

He was about 30, tallish,

long hair, long beard,
small dick...

you know, 'cause guys
with big ones

don't feel the need
to jerk it at little girls.

Okay.

- Uh, I'll file a report, but...
- But what?

Nobody cares
about a pervert on a bus?

We'll let the ITC know.

They'll keep an eye out
for the guy.

Thanks.

You did the right thing,
calling.

Here's my direct line,

if you need anything else.

Door opens, closes

- What?
- "You did the right thing.

- Here's my direct line."
- Please.

You have less
to worry about from him

than from the manager
at the grocery store.

Am I supposed to find comfort
in that sentence?

Dude wanted a blow
in exchange for a job,

giving new meaning
to "blow job."

Wow?

You grow up in this house,

you think that nothing
can shock you anymore.

And then--

what is it with men
and their johnsons--

shaking them on buses,

using them to blackmail
potential employees?

You know, that was probably
a good job too--

benefits,
discounts on groceries.

Sighs

You know what?

He doesn't get away
with this shit.

- I'm going back over there.
- Great.

You want me to come with you?

No, but can you watch Liam?

Oh, shit.
Sorry, I can't.

You just offered
to come with me.

No, I know,
because I knew you'd say no.

I got a checkup.

Sighs

Kick ass, take names.

Don't blow anyone.

You let her sleep in our bed?

You said yourself
she's a crazy bitch.

She is a crazy bitch.

And not a crazy bitch
like you're a crazy bitch,

like, "oh, bitch,
you so crazy." No!

She once tried to beat me
to death with a frozen fish

because I had asked
if there was more broccoli.

And you never know
what's gonna set her off.

What are you doing?
Put that back on.

I'm changing.
Cell phone rings

Teresa will be here
at 2:00.

- Who's that?
- Notary public,

gets her hair done
at mom's salon.

So you have until 2:00 to get
the divorce papers signed,

or I'll show her
who's a crazy bitch.

- Hey.
- Put your shirt on.

Put your shirt on!

Hey, I'm changing.

I'm gonna go take a look
at your car.

- Okay.
- On that foot?

I can handle it.

If you can handle it,
maybe you can handle

the dripping faucet
in our bathroom.

- How'd you do that anyway?
- Shootin' hoop.

I snapped my achilles
posting up some local kid--

he's huge. He's probably gonna
go in the NBA draft next year.

He snapped it
falling in the bathtub

like an old Florida Jew.

Laughs
Which was right after the game.

It was a delayed reaction.

Hey, V, you still have
that mini camera

you use for titty shots?

I need your help with a scumbag
at the grocery store.

- Hey, I'm--
- I know who you are.

Chuckles V, why don't you
go help Fiona at the store?

And while you're there,
see if there's

some more broccoli.

Fine. Come on.

Teresa, here, 2:00.

Holy shit.

A lot of red dots.

All those red dots
are sex offenders

in our neighborhood?

All right, check this out.

Child rapist three blocks over,

did five years
and out on probation.

How does a child rapist
only get five years?

He doesn't--
he gets five years,

plus the beating of this life.
Let's go.

I thought
we were gonna fix the pool.

No, no, no,
you should come, Carl.

- Grab the bat.
- Awesome.

Hey, you want help?

My dad always loves
a good perv posse.

So we're just forgetting
about the guy on the bus?

Hell, no, I'm gonna
teach you self-defense--

Milkovich style.
Come on.

All right, let's go.

Yo, we're going
to jump a pedophile.

- You want to come?
- Aw, sounds great.

But I can't.

You're acting cagey, okay?

And there's been
an Escalade parked

across the street
for longer than makes sense.

What's going on?

I don't want to know?

'Cause if you told me,
I'd have to tell Fiona,

which would upset
the delicate peace

we've recently established?

Right.

Have fun
wailing on the pedophile.

Is there any way not to?

Thank you.

No, thank you, Marta.
Thank you.

- Now you stay strong.
- Come on, baby.

Hello.
May I help you?

I hope so.
I'm Frank Gallagher.

May I start by saying thank you

for all you do
for our suffering little ones.

Thank you, Mr. Gallagher.

This is my son Hymie.

He was born
with an extra chromosome,

through no fault of his own--
Down Syndrome.

It's a lifelong condition.
It's irreversible.

He's a beautiful boy.

Aren't you, Hymie?
Yes, you are.

And believe it or not,
he is already,

at such a young age,
an avid sports fan.

Is that so?

He can watch a ball dribble

up and down a court for hours,

endlessly fascinated.

His little face
just lights up with joy.

It would be so wonderful

if he could see it
all happen in real life.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher.

I-I think
you may be confused.

Our organization
works with dying children,

not children with Down's.

Of course.

Of course.
I know that.

Crying

It's my other child
that's dying.

Sobs Oh, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Blows nose, sobs

Drive.

Chuckles

What the fuck you want?

Convicted child rapist

just moved in down the street.

Let's get the boys.

Rock music



What the fuck
is this little parade?

Kid fucker, next block.

Knock at door

May I help you?

We're looking
for Blake Collins.

Sighs I am Blake Collins.

Oh, shit.

You're the eighth-grade teacher
who screwed her student, right?

You were on TV.

I didn't "screw" William.
I loved him.

And I did my time.
I paid for my mistake--

if love can be called
a mistake.

Sighs I'm sure
there are real criminals

in the the neighborhood
that you can beat up

if you have the inclination.

Now, please,
may I close the door?

Yeah, yeah.

Door closes

Shit.

Let's go find a camel jockey.

Yo, Carl, get home, all right?

Shit, we should still
do something.

You thinking gang bang?

Uh, no,
but she fucks little kids.

It was one kid,
and he wasn't that little.

Look, he was 14.
She was his teacher.

Do we really want a pedophile
living in the neighborhood?

Shit, if it was 14
and had a teacher

who looked like that
and wanted it?

Man, I'm getting wood
just thinking about that.

Yo, Angie?

Yeah?

You want to fuck?

Sure.

Now, see, I thought
you two were, uh...

Shut up.

Hope you're using a raincoat.

You were having sex at 14.

I was having sex
with a 14-year-old at 14.

So you think Kash
should have gone to jail?

Yeah, I do.

I almost called
the cops 100 times.

Should've--
creepy fucking Arab dude

- fucking my little brother.
- I was 15.

I was old enough
to make my own decisions.

You were a kid.
He was a man.

Says you.

You really want this chick
living in the neighborhood?

Think about Carl.

- Carl should be so lucky.
- Okay.

So what if it was Debbie
and a 30-year-old dude?

- Ugh, it's different.
- Bullshit it's different.

Look, she's not hanging around
the park with lollipops.

She fell in love.

It's got nothing to do
with love.

This chick
is a standard-issue pedophile,

and I'm gonna prove it.

Shouting in portuguese _

- Sorry I'm late.
- I hate this INS bullshit.

America is supposed to be
free country, no?

No.

Hey!
That's a nice outfit.

It's not an outfit.
It's a perv trap.

What, is that like
a bear trap--

where your titties
clamp around the wrist

and they have to gnaw off
their own paws?

Both laugh
2:00.

I got it.

She hates me, doesn't she?

No. She just
don't know you yet.

I mean, I get it-- I would hate
me, too, if I were her.

I mean, I show up here
with my kid in tow,

and you haven't seen me
in years.

It's almost like I'm trying
to get you back or something.

But honestly, Kev, I don't even
know if Kyle's yours.

I was really getting around
back then.

So V has nothing
to worry about.

What?
What'd I say?

You think Kyle could be mine?

You didn't do that math?

Shit. Sorry.

Cancer?

How did I get cancer?

You must have caught it
from grammy, son.

If she had known that she had
the contagious kind,

I don't think she would've spent
so much time

with you in the basement,
cooking meth.

Am I going to die?

I hope not.

But right now we have to fight

and fight hard.

You ready to fight
with me, Carl?

Razor whirring

Why do we have to shave it?

Didn't you ever see any shows
about cancer?

Cancer people are always bald.

Grammy wasn't bald.

Grammy hated life.

She wanted to die,
but you love life.

And one
of the most important ways

you can fight the cancer

is to let the sunrays
in through your skull.

Why are you shaving
Carl's head?

Lice.

Since when do you...

parent?

Since you dropped the ball.

The vermin were literally
jumping off his scalp.

Well, make sure
you wash the sheets too, okay?

I look like a woman?

I have lice too?

Yes.
Yes, you do.

Fiona's gonna freak out.

No, Fiona is not
going to freak out,

because Fiona
is not going to know.

You're a man now, Carl.

The cancer makes you a man.

And as a man, it's your job

to keep secrets
from the women who love you.

Jeez, I'm gonna
look like a penis.

Razor stops whirring

I'll get you a hat.

I'll get you a hat.
Razor whirring

Knock at door

- Yes?
- Hi. Uh, how you doing?

I'm-- I'm Lip,
uh, short for Phillip.

I-I just live right over
on 64th.

I'm gonna be a sophomore
next year at Lincoln.

Um, I was walking by your yard,

and it looks pretty overgrown.

I was wondering, um...

can I trim your hedges?

Like, five bucks an hour?

Scoffs
May I trim your hedges?

Oh, right, yeah, sorry.

Um, may I trim your hedges?

Upbeat music



Yeah.

Yeah, it's good.
It's good.

- We're good.
- No!

No, we're just taking fake
wedding pictures for the INS.

No one's gonna see you
in that dress.

The INS will see me!

And if I look like cow,
they will know it fake!

And I will get deported for sure!

And you will go to prison.
Speaking portuguese _

- She's your wife.
- No.

You married her before God, no?

No, I married her
before her father,

who had a gun
pointed at my nuts.

It's different, somehow.

Buy something.

89 cents.

I-I don't get it.

Take the cup out of the trash.

Oh, the stuff's in it!

Just get out.

You need whatever
brain cells you got left.

Why you got to mess
with my business, man?

Why you got to do
your business in my store?

It's not your store.
It's towelhead's store.

- Whatever--
get smarter customers,

'cause I'm not going down
for this shit.

Oh, okay.

So, uh, what you
going down for, then, huh?

Hey, did you really fuck
Angie Zahgo today?

Yeah, I fucked Angie.
Everybody fucks Angie.

You don't fuck Angie?

No.

Huh.
You want to fuck Angie?

I can call her,
get her down here.

No.

Rock music

Grunting

 come on
and work for the Lord

Hey.

Grunts Ow!

- Who are you?
- Kyle.

What's your business here?

I may or may not be related
to your neighbor Kevin.

Oh.

Okay. Sorry.

I'm Debbie Gallagher.

Any idea where
I can get a smoke?

 in the garden of Eden

 Adam-- he said to Eve

 "girl, get away
from that tree

 or the lord might punish me

 that's just
what I have to believe"

Finished already?

Yeah, not quite.
Um, I'm just--

I'm really hot.

Um, could I bother you
for something to drink?

A juice box?

Yes, please.

Uh...

just wait here.

 you know it ain't no chore

 when you're working,
working for the Lord

Hi.

Uh, I-I told you
to wait out there.

Yeah, so sorry.
I just, um--

I wondered if I could bother you
for a sandwich too?

You know, I ain't had lunch.

You haven't had lunch.

"Ain't" isn't a word, Phillip.

Right.

Hey, um, are you a teacher?

Scoffs
I-I used to be.

Oh, I bet you were a good one.

Inhales deeply, stammers
What kind of sandwich?

PB and J?

With the crust cut off?

Yes, please.

And you should've heard her
going on and on

about Kev's cologne and
Old man Johnson, or some shit--

anything she could talk about
that I wouldn't know about.

He's right in there.
You know what you're doing?

Do I know how to make a man
ask me for a hummer?

Wait here.

Sighs

Mm, he was born March 2001.

Weren't we together?

No, remember?
We split up that year.

Got back together after 9/11.

Why did we break up, again?

Oh, yeah.

You tried to run me over
with your car.

Giggles

Yeah, I don't remember
that being funny.

It was fucking scary.

Well, as it turns out,
it was the pregnancy hormones.

You were knocked up.

So he is mine?

I don't know, Kev.
Sighs

We were off and on that year.
There were other guys.

When you left me,

I didn't think
I could raise him on my own.

So I gave him
to my sister Crystal,

'cause she always wanted a kid.

Now she's going through
some shit,

needed me to take him.

And we thought it was time
you knew the truth.

You thought it was time?

You didn't think
it might have been time

at any other point
in the 12 years

- this kid's been alive?
- I'm really sorry, Kev.

You're sorry?
12 years, Cheryl.

You left me!

If there was a chance
that he could've been mine,

you should've told me
about him.

And did I tell you she called
her coffee "Kevy-caf"?

Like a pet name, like they have

some secret language
that I don't speak.

- V, what happened?
- Oh.

Corn dogs, cream cheese,
I got it all on tape.

- He's nasty.
- Right?

Go.
He's waitin' on you.

I want day shifts,
home by 6:00.

Couldn't help but notice
your wedding ring, Bobby.

You want your wife
to see this tape?

Fine. Days.

Just fill this out.

And we'll be taking
some veal cutlets

for our troubles--

actual veal cutlets,

none of your skanky deli meats.

Upbeat music



Go, go, go, go, go.

Speaking portuguese _

Gasps

That is terrible ugly dress.

Your friend, she must not
like you very much.

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

Mmm.

Um, you have a little, uh...

Oh.
Clears throat

Mm.
Chuckles

Oh, no, uh, the other--
the other--

Mm.

Did I get it?

No.

You know, um, can you help me?

How old are you really,
Phillip?

16...

almost.

Sighs

But I've always felt
like an old soul.

Mm.

Oh! Ah.
You-- you mustn't tell anyone.

No, no.
I won't. I won't.

I-I promise you,
just--

you're such a good teacher,
I feel like

I-I got so much
to learn from you.

Have-- you have so much
to learn.

- I do.
- You do. Oh.

Mm, I got to go.

- Go?
- Yeah, homework.

- In the summer?
- Mm.

- Oh, shit.
- Don't go, Phillip.

- I have more to teach you.
- Uh-huh.

- Come with me, Phillip.
- I, uh--

Shh. Don't worry.
Don't be scared, okay?

I'll teach you.

Grunts

Are you coming, Phillip?

Uh, yeah--
yes, I'm coming.

Phone beeping
Bring the peanut butter!

Rock music



Nice place you got here.

What are you doing here?

I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips

and a ginger snap, I'm hoping.

Keep the change.

I'm working.

Well, maybe later.

Happy hour at The Fountain?

Yeah, okay.

Okay.

You got a receipt?

Receipt printing

That your grandpa?

Nah, just a guy
I've been seeing.

Oh, that's the guy
you've been, uh--

you've been seeing?

You guys, like,
picnic together, or, uh...

you gonna get a little dog
with a fucking sweater?

Nah, we don't picnic.
We mostly just fuck...

like you and Angie.

That image--

it's, like, scorched
behind my eyes--

a fire-breathing
one-eyed dragon.

You don't have to smoke,
you know.

It's cooler if you don't.

- Really?
- Everyone smokes.

You're only a rebel
if you don't.

Have you ever seen one
in real life...

like, on a grown-up,
when it's...

like that?

Yeah, I watch lots of porn.

It's way different in real life

than those sketches they show
you in health class, right?

What's Kev like?

Is he cool, or is he batshit
like everyone else in my family?

No, Kev's cool, nice...

like you.

I think I may become a nun.

Nuns don't have sex, right?

You're pretty--

too pretty to be a nun.

Hey, T!
What's up, girl?

You look skinny.

Don't come down here
sweet-talking me, V.

I've been sitting here waiting
for almost an hour.

What?
Kev never showed up?

No. Nobody's here
to sign anything.

And nobody's here
to pay me my money.

And I sure as shit
didn't cart my ass

all the way down here for free.

Hey, you, kid!

Where's your mother?

She and Kev
went to go get a drink.

He was freaking out
about the whole kid thing.

What whole kid thing?

About how I may be Kev's kid.

Debs, be home for dinner.

- I will.
- V?

Veronica, where's my $40?

Here, here, I got it.

Here you go.

Hi.

Am I-- am I gonna get
as sick as them?

Coughs

Only time will tell.

The good news is,
the cancer's in your brain.

And you never were
much of a thinker,

so it probably
won't affect you that much.

Oh, God.
Oh, God!

Wait, wait.

You need to learn to wait,
Phillip, okay?

- No, why-- why--
- Just hold it back.

- I'll get hard again quick,
I-I promise.

No, it gets better
if you delay the gratification.

The joy-- it's even bigger.
Just wait, okay?

Okay, that's--
wow.

That's really fucking good.

What is that?
What is that?

That tingles.
What is that--

some kind
of sex cream or something?

Giggles It's, uh...

it's-- oh, God.

- I don't think I can wait.
- No, no, no.

You can do it, Phillip.

You are my A-plus student.

- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, breathe deeper.

- Mm.
- Slowly.

- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Slowly.

Slow.

Okay?

- Okay.
- Good.

What's, uh--
what-- what's that?

That's, um--
ah, that's weird.

Giggles
Yeah, that's--

that's cold.
What-- what is that?

Well, you trimmed my hedges,

and now I am trimming yours.

Wait, what--
what is that, fucking nair?

You're fresh and clean now,

- just like a baby, Phillip.
- Wait, no, what--

oh, shit.

You said you catered
to dying children.

Sir, The Bulls only give us
so many packages per season

- and it takes months.
- Ow!

What the fuck, Frank?

That's going on
all day, every day.

My son is suffering.

Have you no soul?

If you fill out
an application now,

I can almost guarantee
that for next year--

He doesn't have a year!

Whimpers

There's a camp.

All the spots are full,
but there's a quadriplegic.

He won't get much out of it.

I can bump him for Carl.

Camp?

Like summer camp?

It's beautiful,
on a lake--

a wonderful place
for children to feel normal

one last time.

What the hell am I supposed to
do with a trip to cancer camp?

I've never been to camp.

Baby crying

Jimmy, come sit with me.
I want to show you something.

Come!

Hey.

All of this
romantic pretending, amor,

it make me so hot...

and wet.

Ow.

- Feel.
- Ow.

We should not put
all that water to waste, no?

- No?
- No.

- Ow.
- No.

Este, Este, listen.

- I-I--
- Yes?

- I-I can't.
- Yes.

- I-I--
- Yes!

- I can't.
- Yes!

No.
I can't!

Moans

- I-- no, I can't.
- Yes!

- Oh, fuck!
- Yes! Moans

Indistinct conversation

All right,
what are we gonna do?

- Whose ass am I kicking first?
- There's no ass to kick.

Kev's a little boy with
a "white picket fence" fantasy,

and in walks his wife
with his son.

We don't know that's his kid.

So first thing we do
is get a paternity test.

It's not about blood to Kev.

There's a woman
he grew up with and married

saying her son is his.

- That's stupid.
- It's not. Look at you.

You're a mother to your kids.

Doesn't matter
you didn't push them out.

Kev's the first good man
I've ever loved, you know?

My first love was
named Apollo, enough said.

Then there was Spider.

Laughs Spider?

You can't make that shit up.

No, I...

I can't fight for Kev.

Asking him to pick me over them

is asking him to change
the thing about him

that I love the most.

Screw that.

- Fi...
- No.

- Screw that.
- Fiona.

Sit-- Fi!

- Good catch.
- Kev!

- What the fuck?
- There's kids around.

Oh, you think
they haven't heard it before?

- What, are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

I'm out of my mind,
'cause you and V

are the only things
that have ever made sense

to me in this
whole fucked up world.

Okay, if you guys
can't make it,

Jimmy and I should
just quit right now.

I swear to God,
if you leave V--

- Who's leaving V?
- You're leaving V?

No.
Fiona, what the hell?

The notary, Kev,
the divorce papers?

Oh!

Shit. I had some drinks.

And Cheryl
dropped this kid bomb, and--

- and I forgot.
- Hey!

- You're interrupting.
- Excuse me?

Kev's trying
to get to know his son.

Give my boys their time.

- Your boys?
- No, no, Fiona.

It's not--
it's not what you think.

Look, Cheryl and I
have history-- that's it.

And she's not trying
to steal me away from V.

She just wants me
to meet my son.

I know school
was never your thing,

but you've never been dumb.

If you don't see
what happening here,

just plain dumb.

Come on, Debs, dinnertime.

- Can Kyle come?
- No.

All right.

You know, my mother,

she reminds me very much
of your Fiona--

beautiful, raised six kids,
never complained, a saint.

My father, he was a...

Speaking portuguese _

- A rolling stone.
- She put my hand there.

I didn't even move it.

That is something exactly
like my father would have said.

Did that fatty
actually cop a feel?

He totally copped a feel.

Laughs
You got to be kidding me.

I mean, what's up with that?

Shit, Mickey.
What the hell you doing here?

Ah, from the store, right?

Oh, come on, Ian,
don't be rude.

Invite your boyfriend
back to my place.

I mean, the more
the merrier, right?

Chuckles I'm sorry.

- What'd you call me?
- What?

Oh, Jesus, Mickey!

Faggot.

What the fuck
did you call me, faggot?

Enough. Enough!

Horn honking

- What the fuck, Gallagher?
- Shit, Mickey.

They're gonna call the cops.

- Are you okay?
- Come on!

- Sorry.
- Gallagher!

Sorry.
I'll text you.

Ah, shit!

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

Laughs

Both laughing

Where'd you learn this?

Nowhere.
Just relax and enjoy.

You been watching porn
without me?

'Cause, you know,
I consider that cheating.

No, I haven't,

although I do consider
that rule pretty unrealistic.

I just thought it up.

It's hot, right?

Maybe if I was licking it
off you.

I'm hungry.
Trade places.

- No.
- No?

Chuckles Since when
do you turn down a BJ?

Your dick's not even hard.

What?
I did a little manscaping.

Shit.

It's not my fault, okay?

What-- she's a pedophile!

Look, it was a sting operation.

Look, I took a picture
for the cops.

Fuck the cops.
They had their chance.

Shit.

Sighs

- Smells good.
- What's with Mandy?

Ah, something she wanted to do.

- Where's Jimmy?
- No idea.

What happened
to your head, Carl?

- Lice.
- Again?

Yeah, Frank shaved it.

Yeah, and he got me
into a summer camp.

What?
Why would he do that?

I don't know.
But it's cool, right?

Yeah, it's awesome, Carl.

Sighs

Door closes

I'm gonna know my kid.

I'm gonna know my kid,

and you can't have
a problem with that.

Look, I...

I don't care about Cheryl, V.

I used to, but she's nothing
but a memory to me now.

And I'm sorry...

Sighs
I didn't go see the notary.

But I would
never leave you, ever.

You got to know that.

After everything
we've been through,

you kind of just have
to know that.

Sobs

Whoa. You just snotted
the whole table.

Laughter

Kev?

Kev.

Laughter

What?
What the fuck?

Are they laughing at me?

- No.
- Yes.

- Fiona!
- Fuck you!

- Excuse you?
- Cheryl, listen--

No, I'm done listening.
Kyle, go pack our shit, now.

Cheryl, would you just
listen to me?

You could've had this,
and you want that?

She's some kind of nympho,

has three drawers
full of dildos.

What you doing going through
my shit, bitch?

What's a dildo?

Cheryl, would you just listen?

You're just as thick
as the day I met you.

Cheryl, I get that you're mad,

but I want to be
a father to Kyle.

Now, I'm gonna get you
a place nearby.

He's not yours, Kev.
He isn't even mine.

He's my sister's,
you stupid piece of shit!

What did she say?

What did she say?

- What the fuck, bitch?
- Get her, V!

I'll fuck you up!

Screams

Well, should we
stop 'em, or--?

What, you want to lose an eye?

- Aah!
- You're a crazy bitch!

- Kill her, V!
- Aah!

Bitch, you come into my house

and make up
some shit like that?

Get your hands off me,
you dirty bitch!

Screams Get her off me!

- Shit, the TV!
- No!

Not the TV!

Get the divorce papers, Kev.

- This bitch is about to sign.
- I ain't signing shit!

This way, this way.
Screams

If you want to walk away
with four limbs, bitch,

you're gonna sign.
Kev, the papers!

- Fuck you!
- You're signing!

Snap Aah!

- Sign the papers.
- Aah!

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Screams

Sign it!

You could initial that.

Grunts, panting

Uh-uh, not one word.
Just drive away.

Tires squeal

Whoo.

Bitch, you so crazy.

Hell, yeah!

All cheering

Hell, yeah!

You're still here.

You think I'm getting in a car
with that psycho?

Hey, uh,
can I borrow your phone?

I need to call my mom--
my other mom.

Sure.

You want to eat dinner first?

- Sure.
- Cool.

Knock at door

- You Blake?
- Shakily Yes.

You're moving now, Blake.

- You're moving tonight.
- Excuse me?

I don't excuse you,
you sick bitch.

I don't excuse you
'cause you're hot

or 'cause you're blonde
or 'cause

of what you've got
between your legs.

Come take a look.

You see that?

They're digging your grave.

And you want to be gone before
they get down to six feet.

- How's it going, boys?
- Good.

We dug the Berlanti grave
in what, two hours?

But this dirt
is nice and soft--

- going a lot faster.
- Ticktock.

Kid fucker.

Sighs deeply

- Hey.
- Hey.

You looked stressed.

I do?

- How was your day?
- Good.

How'd it go at the doctor?

Good.
It's healing.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Crying

The world's messed up.

So much ugly shit happens.

I don't know.
Kev and V and--

I trust you.

That's bigger to me
than "I love you."

It's a bigger deal.

I trust you.

for my place in the sun

This is what you missed
last week on Shameless.

It was great.
It was all about me.

Sort of the hero's journey.

Rock music

- Where am I?
- Juarez.

Did I miss Christmas?

You almost missed Easter.

- Morning, Debs.
- 137 days.

He'll be back, Debs.
He always comes back.

Grunting

- Well, hello, Steve.
- Nando.

You know, I was surprised
to see you in the States

'cause I-I thought that the DEA
had you on a watch list.

They do.

So you can imagine how happy
I am to come here.

I've arranged for Estefania
to pursue an economics degree.

I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

When Immigration comes,
you will be her husband.

But that means you can't
get into any trouble.

How am I supposed
to make a living?

Get a job.

Lost my job today.

We gonna have enough
for the property tax bill?

Just, with the check
I got today.

Lip and Ian left early?

They said they had
to pick something up

downtown before school.

- Downtown?
- What they said.

I was hoping you'd give me
a shot at assistant managing,

like we discussed last fall.

Give me 1,000 bucks, I'll find
you a night to promote.

$1,000.
It's all there.

Okay.
You're on the calendar.

- Oh, my God.
- Hey, can you pass me that--

- Daddy!




High Strung's
The Luck You Got

it's not for naught

 you're so sure of

they're not for naught

once before

Gasps Shit!

What's the matter?

$1,000.

- Mm, back to sleep.
- I can't breathe.

Maybe it has something to do
with the pillow on your face.

I gotta pay the property tax.

All right, come here,
come here, come here.

Gasping

Moaning

Stop poking me with that thing.

Thought you liked me
poking you with this thing.

What was I thinking?

Sighs exasperatedly

Is this about the club thing?

I woke up having a panic attack

that I was just like Frank
and Monica taking our money,

except I wasn't even
getting high with it.

You know, you're gonna throw
a kick-ass club night.

You gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

Invest in yourself.

Farts

Are you taking a dump
right now?

- Like clockwork, every morning.
- Jesus.

What, I can't take
a dump in here?

Not in front of me you can't.

You were in the shower.

Yeah, and now
I'm out of the shower.

I wouldn't care if you
took a dump in front of me.

Ugh.

Oh! What's going on?

Frank drunk looking for a bed.

Who the hell let him?

- Debbie!
- We begged her not to.

- He's not
hot-bunking my bed.

Why can't he sleep out
on the porch? It's warm enough.

I want my old bed back.

Oh, hell, no!

Come on, daddy.
Up.

Step, step.

Morning, Frank.

This is my house!

It's okay, daddy.
You can sleep in my room.

Wouldn't do it, Debs.

He's especially ripe
this morning.

Frank smells like dog piss.

Not dog piss!

- Gary the homeless guy.
- Come on, daddy.

Sweet dreams, daddy.

Hey, that's my tent.

I'll hose it off
after he wakes up.

Debs, don't let Frank
in here anymore.

This is his home too.

He disappeared for months.

And now he's back.
Excuse.

Rock music

?

Milk money.

Breakfast.

Did you wash up
after you pooped?

What are you, my mom now?

We're supposed to wash up
after we poop?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Not her keeper.

Don't look if you
don't like what you see.

Sweet.

Pants. Now.

Jesus.

Hey, you going to school today?

Oh, no. Later. Gotta skip
my first three periods,

so I can start clocking
community service hours.

And the last 50 bucks
to the property tax, yo.

This should bring us right
around where we need to be.

I didn't put in the money
from that last

- toxic waste gig I had yet.
- Okay, that's cool.

Hand it over,
and I'll drop it off

before I go to community
service, pay the tax man.

I don't have it.

- Don't have what?
- The money.

I used it to put down
a deposit on a club night.

All right.

Debs, Carl, let's go.
School time.

Gotta bring daddy
his breakfast first.

Uh, but the property tax,
that's already two weeks late.

We're always two weeks late.

I'll have the money back
right after the party.

It wasn't yours to spend.

Yeah, it was.
I earned it.

Oh. Oh, that's how
we're doing this now.

Okay, well, I'll take
the money I made last week

and buy an iPad.

Ian, what are you gonna do
with your paycheck, huh?

New leather jacket?
Liam?

I have an opportunity to make
some real money here, Lip.

It's not that easy.

I've been in
the club business a long time.

Yeah, sure you have.
Slinging cocktails, okay?

Look, you don't know shit
about promoting a club party.

Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Lip.

Jazz music

?

 I'm a working man
with a 9:00 to 5:00

Hey, daddy.
Brought you breakfast.

 Gotta be a slave

And the newspaper.

Good to have you home.

Can you help me
with my social studies project?

It's on the Civil War.

Gotta build
Lincoln's log cabin.

- Deb.
- Hmm?

Too much noise.
I need peace and quiet.

I'm trying to sleep.

Seriously?
You're walking me to the curb?

What, did I go back in time
and turn six?

Have a good day at school,
Carl.

Learn something useful.

Muffled, throbbing music

?

 we called it love

 but even the sun sets
in paradise

 I'm at a payphone
trying to call home

Knocks

Sings along ? all
of my change I spent on you ?

 where have
the times gone


 baby it's all wrong

 where are the plans
we made for two


You like?
Maroon 5.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Have you gotten a job yet?

- No.
- Nando told you to get a job.

Listen, I don't know
what it's like in Brazil,

but we're in a recession here.

Oh. Hmm.

I'll keep my eye on you
from now on, okay?

Excuse me?

Make sure
you don't get into trouble.

We are partners now.

Wherever you go, I go.

Snickers
Like a married couple, huh?

Turns up music

 Even the sun sets
in paradise

 I'm at a payphone

Why they got you
doing this, man?

"B" and "E," theft,
and assault.

- Scoffs Nice.
- You?

Hit a kid with a brick.
Kinda broke his face.

Hey, how many hours
you get for that?

50.

Shit, man, I got 120.

Least there's always
someone with some weed.

Car horn honks

Upbeat rock music

Hey, got any weed?

10 bucks a joint.

See, what'd I tell you?

What's up with the geek squad?

Is that
the fucking cast of Glee?

Yeah. Looks like
a bunch of do-gooders.

More like a bunch of
gonna get their ass kicked-ers.

 Back in high school

 when I really liked you

 I was always just a friend

Hey, Meg.

Hey. What's up?

Wanted to get your staff list.

Oh, yeah, sure.
That's a good idea.

Was also wondering if we could
renegotiate my split of the bar.

15% doesn't work for you?

I heard Wendell
gets, like, 30%.

He's my best promoter.

He brings in,
like, a huge crowd.

It's your first gig.
It takes time.

What if she brought
her own booze?

We'll get it from Kev.

Make more money,
it'll work out better.

Gonna have to make it
worth my while.

We could do the same split,

except I keep the 85%
and give you the 15%.

Sighs

Okay.
Bring your own booze.

But I want 20%.

 Tattooed in my mind
just like a memory

 when I looked in your eyes

Fires

 You call me, I call you

 I see you every day
at school

Grunts Yeah.

Come on, GI.

Pound me like an Iraqi soldier.

Okay, you need
to shut the fuck up.

Laughs Oh, I'm sorry.

Still talking.

Hey!
What's going on under there?

- Fuck, fuck.
- Who is it?

Probably a teacher
or some shit.

I told you you were too loud.

Look, I can't get expelled.
My parents will kill me.

Probably hearing about the gay
sex will kill 'em sooner.

Lookee what we got here.

Mickey?

Thought you
were still in juvie.

Not anymore.

Coughing

You having some sort
of queer-bo sex under here?

Gasping No, no, I swear.

Why are you still beating me up?
He was doing it too.

You're the one taking it
in the ass, right?

You're the one
I gotta kick straight.

It working?

- Yes, yes.
- Good.

Get the hell outta here.

You got any fuck left in you,

or you dump it all
in that faggot's ass?

Rock music

Hymie crying

Oh, my little chee-chee.

Please don't cry.

Crying

Please don't cry,
my little boy.

Please don't cry.
Crying

Mama's so tired.

Don't you want to give
your wee lungs a--

Aah!

Aah.

Oh, God, that's so loud.

Everything's so loud.

Maybe when we go inside,
Jody can rub your tummy.

And mama,
she can take a little nap.

Sighs

I don't remember Karen causing
such a fuss as you, Hymie.

Maybe it's
from your Chinese side.

Okay.

Cool, you got Hymie
to quiet down?

Hymie!

Rock music

No!

No! No, no, no,
he's not trash!

Whoa! Whoa!

He's not trash!

No, Hymie!

No, no, no!

Hymie crying Oh, Hymie!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Hymie!
Hymie!

Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my-- oh, my--

Hymie.

I'm so sorry!

It's okay, Sheila, he's fine.

No, but he was almost
swallowed up by the truck!

Oh, my-- I'm such
a terrible mother.

No, you're just--
you're just a tired mother.

Sobs
No, no, I--

I don't deserve to live.

- Come on, let's go back inside.
- I'm such a t-- No.

We'll call Debbie
to come baby-sit again,

and we'll get some rest.

- Okay? Come on.
- I'm sorry, baby.

- It's okay.
- No, no, no!

You ever shoot crack?

No.

Ever eat mescaline-laced
mushrooms?

Inhales Nope.

Put a tequila-soaked tampon
up your ass?

What?
No, dude.

I get it. I'm-- I'm obviously
not as cool as you.

Smells good.

Yeah, it's, um, primo stuff.

20 bucks a joint.

Can I buy five?

Yeah, sure thing.

I'm Casper.

- Lip.
- Grizz.

You live around here?

About four blocks over.

Cool.
Coughs

I guess.

Where you from?

Uh, Lakeshore.

I didn't choose it,
I was just born there.

What are you doing
slumming it down here?

Chuckles City Youth.

We're, uh, beautifying Chicago
one block at a time.

Good luck with that.

Those flowers-- they're not
gonna last about two hours.

Just looks good
on my tufts application.

Admissions people are into you
helping out the poor and shit.

Oh, sorry.

It's okay.

I'm not offended.

Hey, uh,

you interested in beautifying

any other parts
of the neighborhood?

Anything to beef up my CV.

Think I may have
something for you.

See if I can work it out.

Dude, hit me up anytime.

I'm on Facebook.
Casper Duncan.

You got it, Casper Duncan.

Man, that was good.

Missed ya.

You did?

Yeah, man.

I had to do
all the fucking in juvie.

Otherwise I'd end up
someone's bitch, right?

Nice to switch back.

Thought you had
four more months.

Yeah, let me out
for overcrowding or some shit.

Coming back to school?

Spits, scoffs

Hell, no, man.
I'd still be a fuckin' freshman.

I haven't passed
a single class.

Why'd you come back, then?

Fronted a bunch of coke
before I went in.

Time to collect.

Oh!

That's good.

So good.

Third call this week
from that same woman, Kev.

- She won't leave a message?
- No.

Probably a fucking
bill collector.

Can you just keep
dodging her, please?

Hi, baby.
How's the foot?

It's goddamn itchy.

What are you two
foxy ladies up to?

Need to bum some liquor off ya.

For her club night.

What, they don't
have booze over there?

She'll make more money
if she brings her own.

All right.
Hobble this way.

Honky-tonk music playing

?

Women chuckling

Okay, how much you need?

More than this.

There's gonna be at least
200 people there, babe.

Have you ever seen
more than 20 deadbeats

in here at one time?

What about
your liquor distributor?

Could I get
the booze from them?

Yeah, maybe.

Walter's a cool enough guy,
for a Roselli.

What? You're dealing with
the mob? You never told me that.

Stan burned
every bridge in town.

Walter's the only
liquor distributor

that'll do business with us.

How much would the booze cost?

For 200 people?
Top shelf? Close to 5 grand.

For well drinks,
you'd probably get away with 3.

Would he let me set up
an account and invoice me later?

Yeah, maybe.
He'll do a credit check, though.

I've got perfect credit.

No credit does not
equal perfect credit.

Do you even have
a social security number?

He'll want you to leave
one of the kids as collateral.

Okay, I get it.

I'll just buy the booze
from him up front, then.

Whose money you gonna use?

Douche bag.

Rock music

?

Uniform sales.

Bus driver.

Short order cook.

- How's it going, Jim-nasium?
- Hey, what's going on?

Can I borrow
some money from you?

Yeah, sure, how much?

$5,000? Pay you back
after my club night?

What?

Yeah, kinda strapped right now.

I got, like, uh,
300 bucks on me.

Are those my jeans, Frank?

Found 'em upstairs in my room.

It's not your room anymore.

You're cutting
her jeans into shorts?

Had three pair of my own,
but somebody tossed my clothes.

These are, like, $120.

I got 'em at Goodwill
for, like, 40 bucks!

Sighs

Can you go to the bank
and get more money?

I don't have any.

What about your parents?

I haven't gotten anything
from them since I was 18.

- Really? College?
- Cars, insurance.

Okay, I haven't gotten any
cash from them since I was 18.

For two years you've been
offering to give me money,

and now when I ask,
you don't have any?

I'm sorry.

This is why I never
ask anybody for help.

- I feel like a jackass now.
- Whoa, hey. Are you mad at me?

Because you get mad at me
when I offer you money,

and now you're getting mad
because I can't?

I'll just figure it out
myself, okay?

- Okay.
- Let's go, V.

Frank, what the hell?

I got that roast chicken
for dinner tonight!

My house, my kitchen,
my fridge, my chicken.

I cut these too short.
My balls are hanging out.

Yeah.

Nice ass.

Scoffs Thought you were
my history teacher Mr. Crouch.

Well, sorry to disappoint.

Hey, how was Community Service?

Yeah, good.

I met some North Side kids.

Think I can make
some dough off 'em.

Cool.

Yeah, gotta do what I can

with my sister stealing a bunch
of our property tax money.

Well, that was cunty of her.

You know, you should be in
charge of your family's money,

not Fiona.

Mr. Gallagher,
just left Mr. Healey's office.

Rumors about you two true?

Said you were supposed
to ask me for a recommendation.

Sure, in his mind,
I was supposed to do that.

A letter of recommendation
from a science teacher

looks good
on your college applications.

Bet it does.

So we got 20 cases of beer,
16 cases of wine,

got two cases of champagne.

I got 10 liters of vodka,
six gin, four rum,

four scotch, four bourbon,
and enough mixers and garnishes

for, like, 200 people.

- Sound about right?
- Yup.

And I can return
whatever I don't use?

Absolutely.

Let me just tally this up here
for you.

What are you doing?

Scoffs Ordering booze.
What's it look like?

I hope the payment
doesn't involve my titties.

Okay, my dear,
I got you in at $4,857,

which includes the 10% discount
'cause you're a friend of Kev's.

And I went ahead
and waived the delivery fee

'cause you're
a first-time customer.

How would you like
to pay for this?

- Check.
- Need a pen?

Yes, please.

Let me go check the schedule,

see what time we'll get this
out to you, okay?

Mm-hmm.

- 'Scuse me.
- Yes.

Is there more than $17
in that account?

By the time the check clears,
I'll have it covered.

The guy is in the mob.

You' cutting him a check
trading on Kev's good name?

Gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

If I don't invest in myself,
no one else ever will.

Knocks

Muffled Come in.

Oh, surprised to see you

at the college counseling
center, Miss Milkovich.

Came to talk to you about Lip.

I'm not at liberty
to discuss another student,

but I'd be more than happy
to help you

with your future options.

Scoffs Please.

You and I both know
my only options

are getting pregnant
or getting arrested,

so cut the crap.

Okay.

Then Lip.

He's got a good chance
of getting out of here.

And what are you
doing about it?

Encouraging him
to go to college.

Doesn't seem to be
too interested.

You're a guidance counselor.
Fucking guide him.

There's only so much I can do.

- What should he be doing?
- Keeping his grades up.

Getting teacher
recommendations,

finding himself
a legitimate job,

filling out
his college applications.

Now, you think you can help
with any of that?

Maybe.

All right, stop by
at the end of the day,

I'll post
some college brochures,

you could take 'em with you.

I think you have
a better chance

of getting through to him
than I did, Lysistrata.

What?

Show up for English
once in a while,

and you'll get the reference.

All right.

Let's go, buddy.

All right.

Yeah.

Daddy.

No, I'm not black enough or
drunk enough to be your daddy.

Whoa!

- Mommy.
- Yeah.

Mommy.

You seriously gonna keep
following me everywhere I go?

It's my job.

Don't you ever have
to go to the bathroom?

Okay.
Dialing phone

Okay, Liam.
There you go.

Hey, Este, it's me.

Hi.
Panting

Why are you breathing so hard?

Gym.

You never know with you.

So Beto is sitting out front.

He follows me wherever I go.

Your father told him
to keep an eye on me?

- Don't worry. He's harmless.
- Who?

Your father or Beto?

Because neither of them
seemed harmless

when they were dicing up Marco.

Beer.
I need beer.

Panting

Just a second, Frank.

Stay out of trouble,
and you'll be fine.

All right, listen.
I gotta go.

I gotta run some errands,
make some money for Fiona.

Look, my dad is a hothead.

Blows off steam,
threatens lives,

and then cools down,
forgets why he was mad.

He is gemini.

He will call Beto off soon.

Okay.

Rock music

?

Gracias.

Hey, uh, 'scuse me.

What happened to all the meth
heads squatting in here?

Who the hell are you?

Concerned neighborhood citizen.

Took me six months
to get rid of 'em.

Yeah, I heard there were
dead bodies in there too.

Yeah. Four, yeah.
Coyotes got to 'em at one point.

Gonna take me eight weeks
to make it livable again.

How much you paying these guys?

Too much.

Might have
a better deal for you.

Gunshots, explosion

- How's the pasta?
- Good.

You're like our maid now.

Thanks, Carl.

Gunshots on TV

Car engine revs

Hey, Debs,
watch Liam for a bit.

- I gotta run an errand.
- No can do.

- Baby-sitting for Sheila.
- Carl.

Can I stay up late
and watch TV?

Absolutely.

Rock music

?

I'm going to Sheila's tonight,
daddy.

Baby-sitting.

A noble job, Debs.

That stupid baby's
still crying?

Won't stop.

Hey, that's my toothbrush.

And thanks
for sharing it with me, son.

- Oh, man, eew!
- Now that we're a family again,

I want to encourage us to be
all for one and one for all.

Ew, gonna have to boil it now.

You need the number
over at Sheila's?

Where I'll be.

No, why would I?

I'll be heading out
to the Alibi soon.

Oh, and don't worry about me
walking home late at night.

I have a pillowcase
full of bars of soap.

Good for you.

You get along a lot better

with a weapon and a kind word
than a kind word alone.

Any of that spaghetti left?

Gunshots on TV

Oh, darn it.

Sizzles

Ew.

Sighs

Drill whirring

What are you doing?

Keeping Frank out.

Planning to go
to Carnegie Mellon?

Please.

That's for nerds and homos.

But, um, Healey
thinks Lip should apply.

Fat chance.

He's smart enough.

Yeah, but too stupid
to do anything about it.

I already tried.

Hey, can I ask you a question?

Sure.

How do you know if a guy

you've been hanging out with
likes you?

You like him?

Uh-huh,
but I think he hates me.

Ask him.

Doesn't want to talk about it.

No guy ever does.

How do I know, then?

Does he get that look
in his eye when he's with you?

What look?

You'll know when you see it.

Hymie crying

Did you know that Abe Lincoln
lived in a one-room log cabin

when he was born, Hymie,

and that his grandfather was
ambushed and killed by indians?

Some historians say that
because he was cold to women,

he might've had
homosexual tendencies.

Debbie? Deb?

The whole point
of you baby-sitting Hymie

was to keep him quiet, so Jody
and I could get some sleep.

Sorry, Sheila, he won't stop.

Hymie crying

Why don't you take him
for a walk?

- Where?
- I don't care.

Just anywhere.

Just don't come back
for a few hours.

Okay?

Cell phone rings

Hey, what's up?

Hey, where are you?

I am...

Clicks running an errand.

Where are you?

Uh, at V's, changing.

I'm gonna run by the club,
talk to this promoter.

See if we can
get his email list

to invite more people
to my party.

Good idea.

You mind watching the kids?

Got it covered.

- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Okay, okay, okay, I'm out.
I'm out, I'm out.

Oh.

Why you steal Porsche?

I needed money
to help my girlfriend.

You have a car at home.
Sell that.

How am I
supposed to get around?

Nando will kill us both
if you get into trouble.

Okay, I promise
not to do it again, okay?

You betray me.

What are you doing?

Cracks Ow!

Fuck me!

Holy shit!

Clean break, I think.

Don't screw with me again.

Fine. Okay.

- Come on.
- Ow.

I take you to the hospital,

then we go get
American Whoppers, huh?

Car chirps

 You've got it

 the way
you grinding up on me

 I know, I know you want me

?

 the way
you kissing up on me

 I know, I know you need me

?

Hey, Meg, is Wendell around?

Uh, yeah, right over there.

 The way
you grinding up on me

Thanks.

I'll tell you this.

For all of their laziness
and lack of motivation,

Mexicans are a lovely people.

Why'd you go down there, Frank?

Hey, I'll take another, Kev.

Sometimes a man
just has to get away,

be alone with his thoughts.

Hey!

Jesus.

So what, you woke up
from a drunken stupor,

didn't know where you were?

I knew exactly where I was.

Had a business opportunity

with our south-of-the-border
brothers.

- What did you do to your foot?
- It fell off.

Was the only prosthetic
I could afford.

What kind
of business opportunity?

I was hired to move
some inventory.

Drug mule?

Only the best
the mexicanos have ever seen.

Not something you really want
to be bragging about, Frank.

- Which end did it go in?
- Yo, Frank.

Some chick's outside
with a baby looking for you.

Oh, no.

- Who is it, Frank?
- I-I-I don't know.

But does that sound like
good news to you?

I'm gonna slip out the back.

Sounds like you were

slipping it out the back
in Mexico, Frank.

Laughter

Baby crying

Shh.

Daddy.

Wait, you're the chick
with the baby?

Kev won't let me in
after 6:00 PM anymore.

What the hell's wrong
with Liam?

- This isn't Liam, it's Hymie.
- Well, jeez.

Shut him up.

Sheila has an oriental baby?

I have to finish
my Civil War project...

- Jesus.
- ...and he won't stop crying.

You were always
so good with Liam.

Give-- give him--
give him to me.

Open his mouth.

- What is that?
- Valium.

Are you supposed
to give Valium to a baby?

Oh, yeah.
It always worked with you.

Oh.
Hymie's crying subsides

Voila.

Thanks, daddy.

Hey, loan me 20 bucks, will ya?

Sighs

I only have five.

That'll do it.

Clattering I hate you!

Glass shatters

 Come, come, baby, yeah

 come, come, baby, yeah

 push my button,
make me wanna play

Chuckles

Your friend likes to dance.

The tequila likes to dance.

Yeah.

So you think
you're gonna be able

to pull this off
tomorrow night?

Hope so.

I bet you will.

Looks like you have
some real talent.

You're not talking about my
club promoting skills, are you?

What makes you say that?

Your hand on my knee.

I meant to put it
up your skirt.

Oh.

What are the chances of me

getting ahold
of your email lists?

Why would I give them to you?

Mm, satisfaction of knowing
you're helping a good person.

No, I can't come inside that.

I could give you
a cut of my bar, then.

10%?

You know how long it took me
to build up my list?

You honestly think I'd risk it
on you throwing some lame party

and ruining my brand
for anything less than 50%?

Well,
that's an interesting offer.

Let me discuss it
with my partner.

 Come, come, baby, yeah,
come, come, baby, yeah

He wants 50% of the bar
for his email list,

and he's a giant douche bag.

No worries.

I swiped his phone
from his jacket

as soon as I saw
his hand on your knee.

Has all his contacts.

Gotta be entrepreneurial,
right?

- Aah!
- Aah!

- Debbie?
- Nighty-night, Hymie.

Whispers Oh, my goodness.

How did you do it, Debbie?

Whispers
Daddy's good with babies.

Frank?

Sighs

You just getting home?

Oh, hey.
Still awake?

Where have you been?

Uh, Emergency Room.
Slammed it in the door.

- Yeah.
- Well, you're in trouble.

You let Carl stay up late
on a school night.

Oh.

I think you need a spanking.

Hmm?

I can't do it
with your pants on, though.

Then I should take them off.

Very bad boy.

I've been a bad, bad boy.

Bad.

This Purdue place looks cool.

I want mommy to show me
how bad I've been.

There's no way she's gonna

make the money back
for the property tax.

Says they're one of the top

engineering schools
in the country.

I'm gonna have
to figure out a way

to make up the 1,000 bucks
she's gonna lose.

Giggling You listening to me?

Yeah, you know,
it's kind of hard

with the, uh, porno going
on across the hall.

Is it wrong that
it's kind of turning me on?

Yeah, me too.

Giggling

Muffled speech

- Morning.
- Hey.

Jimmy gonna come down
to make us breakfast?

He's sleeping in.
Eat your cereal.

- Wore him out, huh?
- You too. Eat your cereal.

Spoiled now.
Need an omelet.

So, um, how's the club night
thing coming?

Gonna be a big success.

Probably make enough money
to roll it into another one.

Take out a small loan,
really get things going.

What's wrong, Debs?

Sighs Got home late.

Baby-sitting.

So the ghetto girl

thinks she can live
the American dream, huh?

Maybe it's my time, Lip.

Chuckles
None of your business, Mandy.

Don't you see,
it doesn't work like that, sis.

When you're poor,
only way to make money

is to steal it or scam it,

like Don King or Joe Kennedy.

Daddy's home!

- Brought friends.
- Howdy!

- Just dump it.
- Hey, that's my bike!

Doesn't really work anymore.

Yeah, because you
bent the rim, Frank.

And where's the seat?

That's why it hurt so much
when I rode it.

Come on, fellas.

Get some brekkie,
soak up the alcohol.

- Do you have sourdough?
- Hey, this is our food!

Don't be rude.

Is this about money, Fiona?

Because I am happy
to pay my share.

That's all you ever want
from me anymore anyway.

There.
You happy, huh?

That's about $300 worth.

Come on, lads!

Let's go upstairs,
take a disco nap

till the Alibi's open again.

Dad, no, no.

- Lip, don't.
- This is my home.

You have no right
to kick me out of it.

I am an important part
of this family.

No, you're not.

You don't live here anymore.

Fine.

If that's the way
you want it, I'll leave.

Phil, Chester, I'm sorry.

My family
doesn't want me here anymore.

Charge!

Overlapping chatter

Jackass!

That's it.
Let's go! Go!

Stop it, guys!
Stop!

Just pick a bed, fellas!
Just pick a bed. Oh, my God!

What the hell are you doing?

Shouting

Get the fuck outta here!

Come.
You are not sleeping here.

- No, stop!
- Come on.

Get up, get up!

Overlapping chatter
He's not doing anything!

You are not going to--

- Go!
- What's the matter with you?

Gasps

Well, that's
a piece of shit anyway.

Sighs

Frank!

Debs...

Damn it, Frank,
get the fuck out!

No, you cannot do this to her!

- Come on! Get up right now!
- Jesus! What's the--

- Get out!
- Get out!

Jesus!

Stop!

I treated you well!
And you--

- Ow!
- How could you do this to me?

Stop! Stop--

Get out of my house!
I hate you!

- I don't even care!
- Jesus!

Get out! Get out!

Dad.

- Get him out.
- Ow, God!

- Debs!
- Debs!

Muffled crying

Get out!

I hate you! Get--

don't you touch me!

Panting

Sobs Oh, my God.

Get out!

After everything
I have done for you,

this is the thanks I get.

- Where should we put him?
- Where he belongs.

- Open it up, Carl!
- Got it.

Whatever, you--

Jesus Christ!

Not funny!
Not funny at all!

Gonna need you to clean
the blood splatter on the walls,

evidence marks on the floor,
and patch up the bullet holes.

That should get you started.

- Supplies are inside.
- Shit.

You okay, buddy?

Been trying all morning
to get tickets

to the Wilco concert
at Soldier Field tonight.

- Can't get through.
- Wilco?

Aren't they for, like, dads with
receding hairlines and shit?

Come on, Wilco is the beacon
of anti-commercialism.

Yeah, because no one
wants to buy their whiny music,

they gotta give it away
for free.

Shit.

All right, here you go.
It's 50 bucks a head.

That's $400.

Hey, hey, um,

is there any chance I can get an
advance on the next couple days?

Hey, slow your roll, kid.

I haven't seen
what they could do yet.

- Se√±or.
- Yeah?

This man stole our jobs?

No, no, I didn't steal them,
I just underbid you.

But we are illegal immigrants.
How can you underbid us?

Ghetto white's the new brown.

- The what?
- The new brown.

This is unfair.

Just living
the American dream, amigo!

Okay, let's keep eight cases
of that beer up front,

and put the rest
in the back refrigerator.

Hello.

People showing up already?

 Turn it up, turn it off now

- ? turn it up... ?
- Can I help you?

Alderman Edward Gretsky,
15th Ward.

Okay.

Throwing a party, I see.

Something like that.

Just a friendly visit.

You know, make sure you filled
out all your applications.

Applications?

Business license, liquor
license, umbrella insurance.

Well, I'm sure Meg handled
everything that you need.

She did.
For her business.

What?

Well, you're running
the show now, right?

Well, just for tonight.

Then just for tonight

I'll make an exception
on the applications for...

small filing fee.

- A filing fee?
- Let's say $1,000.

Wouldn't want
any pesky policemen or firemen

showing up now, would we?

?

I'll come back later
to collect.

Let's say 2:00 AM.

?

How is the pinky?

It's doing okay.

So listen, my girlfriend's
having a party tonight.

It's important that I go.

Is there going to be
alcohol there?

It's a party, it's kind of
how these things work, yeah.

- Drugs?
- Maybe.

- Bad things may happen.
- Yeah, or not.

I go with you.
Just to make sure.

Yeah, see, that's the thing
is that you can't go with me

because then I'll have
to explain who you are,

how I know you,
that my life's in danger.

I mean, that won't
go over very well.

Then you stay home.

Rock music

?

Hey, Sanchez.

- Aw, hell.
- Time to pay up.

- They let you out?
- Good behavior.

I thought I had
four more months.

Think again.

Hey, yo,
campus security is coming.

The hell are you doing?

Didn't want you to get busted.

I can look after myself,
thank you.

Does he get that look
in his eye-- look in his eye--

look in his eye
when he's with you?

Just got outta juvie, remember?

- The fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

You look great.

Thanks, Debs.

You okay with what happened
this morning? Frank?

Jimmy's in the bathroom puking.

Sighs

Vomiting

Knocks What's going on?

Something I ate.
It's not sitting well.

Vomits You need anything?

Vomiting loudly

No, I'm just bummed
I can't make it tonight.

I mean, I really wanted to go.
Flushes toilet

If you feel better later,
come on over, okay?

Okay.

Knocks
Go away. We're not buying.

Banging

Jeez.

I know, I know,
you want me to find Jesus.

I already found him, thanks.

I'm looking for Kev.

Kevin Ball.

I'm his wife.

 I ask myself why
but I don't know

 fairy tales...

Tommy!

Hey, you still got that garage?

Yeah, it kinda
comes with the house, Frank.

Great. What's say
you let me sleep there?

What's say I don't.

- Why the hell not?
- Because the last time

you stayed at my place,
you shit in my kitchen sink.

The layout of your home
is very confusing.

No, Frank.

No means no.

Fuck you, Tommy.

Fuck you means fuck you.

Kermit!

My best friend.

You can't stay with me, Frank.

Wh-- what if
I suck your dick?

Frank.

What if you immigrate
to Mexico, Frank?

Reverse the prevailing tide.

Why are you even here?

Should be
collecting disability.

'Cause I didn't
injure my foot at work.

Hey, let me crash
at your place.

I'll tell the insurance company
that you did.

Why can't you stay
at your place, Frank?

Ungrateful little shits!
That's why.

Things I do for them.

Blood, sweat, and tears.

This is not how a family
treats each other. Phone ringing

Yeah.

Hang on.
It's for you. V.

Hey, baby, what's going on?

What?

No, yeah, okay.

Okay, I'll be right there.

Watch the bar.

Little redheaded bitch
is the worst of 'em.

Expect it from the others,
but not from--

not from--
from...

her--
Debbie.

Orphan Annie turned on me.

That's how I got
all these bruises.

She hit me.
With a bat.

Now, I can't touch her.
No.

That is child abuse.
I'd get reported.

Rock music

?

Operator, can you connect me
with Child Welfare Ser--

Services?

Yes, hello.
I would like to report, uh...

a-a negligence situation.

2119 North Wallace.

Gallagher.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.

Not-- n-not that they
don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, viol-- What?

No, if it's all right, I would
like to remain anonymous.

No, thank you.

And God bless you.

That is an all-time low.

Even for you, Frank.

?

 charge amex, see

 like you got an "A,"
score credit

 living that American dream

 you could be a celebrity

 when you step on the scene

 I know you gotta look hot

 you and your girls
with dresses

 turn that sound up

 you are in the limelight

 until they cut
your power out

 shopping like a rich girl

 rich girl, like a rich girl

 shopping like a rich girl

Hey, V, where are you?

This place is insane!
We did it!

 like a rich girl

 credit card, max it out

Muffled club music

?

Hey, is this the club

where Wilco's gonna play
a secret concert?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, uh,

20 bucks, self-parked.
30 valet.

- I'll park it myself.
- Cool.

Uh, just pull over
right down there.

That lovely lady
will show you to your spot.

- Thank you.
- Cool. Have fun.

- Yo.
- Hey, Lip.

How you doing, man?

Good. Got your text about
the impromptu Wilco concert.

Tweeted everyone I know.

Thought you might.

Hey, hop out.
I'll have someone park your car.

- Thanks.
- Cool.

Surf rock music

?

How long we doing this for?

Figure we park
about 30 more cars,

make enough money to cover
the property tax,

at which time people
will probably start to realize

Wilco's not playing
at Fiona's club.

Then we bolt.

Out.

Where am I supposed to go?

Hymie crying

Just-- just shake him.
Hymie crying

You're not supposed
to shake a baby.

I know, but maybe it'll
make him stop crying.

Yeah, because his brains
will get scrambled.

- They already are!
- Sheila!

I'm just saying maybe it'll

scramble 'em
back together again.

Howdy, folks.

You need help with that baby?

- Frank?
- How'd you get in my house?

I still have a key.

I-I-I got a proposition
for you, Sheila.

- What? No!
- Frank, you have to leave.

No, let me stay,
and I'll be your wet nurse.

I don't mean your wet nurse,
that involves breast-feeding,

but your nurse,
your baby nurse.

Room and board, you'll get
eight hours of sleep a night.

I can promise you that.

Debbie did say
he was good with babies.

There, you see?
My reputation precedes me.

Just give me five minutes.

Aw, hell.
Give me 30 seconds.

If I can't put
this little tyke to sleep,

I'll-- I'll leave, pronto.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hymie crying

Yeah, yeah.
Oh, oh.

I got you.

Raised eight kids myself.

I know what I'm doing.
Chuckles

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Here you go.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Hymie quiets Yeah.

Ah.

H-how--

how did you do that, Frank?

I think I'll take
a shower before bed.

75, 76, 78.

Okay. Just over 10 grand.

That's not bad.

So, 15% for you.

I thought we agreed on 20.

Right.

$2,000.

Thank you.

Take mine anytime you're ready.

Look forward to doing business
with you in the future.

This is to cover my booze.

And that leaves me
with 2 grand.

Didn't forget
about us, did you?

Of course not.

Thanks, Fiona.

 Do you want my love, boy

- ? do you want my love ?
- Five, six, seven, eight...

$900?

That's all I have left?

That's not bad
for your first gig.

But that doesn't even
cover my deposit.

I lost $100 doing this night.

Surprised you didn't lose more.

It took me, like, eight gigs
before I saw a profit.

You gotta pay your dues.

?

 do you want my love

Distant police sirens wail

Hey.

What's going on?

Can I sleep here tonight?

Sure.

How'd you do?

It's gonna take a while
till I start making money.

Here.
Almost all of it.

I'll get the rest, I promise.

- Ah, keep it.
- What?

Well, if you're gonna gamble
our money,

you should hold onto it, right?

Scoffs I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

Oh, congratulations.

You risked everything,
and you didn't even break even.

It was my first time
doing this.

That's not the point.

You made a decision without
consulting the rest of us.

- I'm in charge of this family.
- Really?

No, I'm sorry, that's--
that's news to me.

You see, Fiona, if we're gonna
be every man for himself,

this family
is going under fast.

Here,
just take the money, okay?

Pay the property tax. I'll get
the rest tomorrow somehow.

No, I don't need it.

What?

I took care
of the situation myself.

How?

Told a bunch of North Side kids

that Wilco was playing
at your party.

It's like I said.

The only way to make money
when you're poor

is to steal it or scam it.

But hey, um, let me know if
the rules are changing, right,

and you're gonna pull
this shit again?

Maybe I'll have to take
over the family money, huh?

Rock music

?

Are we sure about this?

He raised six great kids.

Look at him.

He's like the baby whisperer.

For those of you who were doing

open-heart surgery or bringing
peace to the Mid-East

or whatever the fuck
you were doing,

this is what you missed
on Shameless last week.

Baby crying It's your turn.

Get your goddamn ass
out of this bed!

It's your fucking turn!

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

Hymie has his first well baby
appointment today.

I'll take him.

Nice place you got here.

- What are you doing here?
- I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips
and a ginger snap.

- Can I help you?
- This is my son, Hymie.

Our organization
works with dying children.

Of course.
I know that.

It's my other child
that's dying.

Carl.
Carl.

- A word.
- Cancer?

You said you cater
to dying children.

Camp?

I've never been to camp.

Here he comes.

Hey, thanks for bailing me out.

All Mandy.

She used her dad's
line of credit

at Bad Bob's bonds.

Mandy.
Bein' smart?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Excuse me.
I was thinking

there might be a job opening.

Tell me, Fiona.

How do you feel
about deli meats?

Are you saying that,
if I blow you,

I can have a job?

Hey, V, do you still have

that mini camera you use
for titty shots?

He's right in there.
Do you know what you're doing?

I got it all on tape.
He's nasty.

I want day shifts,
home by 6:00.




The High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 think of all the luck
you got

 know that it's not
for naught

 you were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 what is this down side

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 round up the friends
you got

 know that they're not
for naught

 you were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 what is this down side

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Stay down.

Stay down!

- Stay. Stay.
- How long was that?

Not long enough.
You need at least 90 seconds.

City pools are filled
with city kids,

and by "city kids"
I mean black kids who swim.

Little stereotype-breakers,

like those two kids that ripped
your bathing suit last year.

They were turning it
into a bikini.

If they'll do that
when you're just running

through the sprinklers
at your own house,

think what they'll do
when they have

a large body of water
at their disposal.

Savage little cosby kids

will drown your ass.

Times have changed.

Yeah, that's what they said

when they were holding me
underwater repeatedly

in the summer of '67,

the so-called
summer of love.

Not at the Sullivan Street pool,
it wasn't.

It was the summer
of drowning whitey.

And until you can hold
your breath

longer than they can hold
their breath,

you're not going
to Sullivan Street.

Sighs Go.

Whoa, can I try?

No, Carl, you've got cancer.

Pack your bag.
We're leaving.

Telephone rings

Grunting

Milkovich house.
Speak briefly, then shut up.

Both moaning

Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.

The lady upstairs is gonna tell
the police I'm an orphan

if a family member
doesn't come get me.

Please come.

Answering machine beeps

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister,

whose meth head mother
apparently died.

What?
You have a sister?

Half.

Want to finish?

Sure.

Oh, my God, you are so
unbelievably tasty right now.

Giggles

Don't wait for me.

What, are you charging

- by the minute, Madam V?
- Yes.

Well, thank you
for watching my wallet,

you dirty little whore.

I am a dirty little whore.

Put me on my back,
would you, please?

Oh, hello.
Giggles

Moans

Oh, you've been working
on your Kegels.

Oh.
Oh, you're flexing this.

Moans Oh, you're flexing,

oh, you're flexing that.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Exclaims

Roll over, Hulk Hogan.

Both groaning

You want me to finish you off?

I'm good, hon. We got to save
your sperm for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

You cool?

Yeah.

Yeah, it just--
I just wish you had given me

a heads-up before I went
with the whole whore thing.

You know, I don't want
our kid's first impression

of you to be
that you're a whore.

It was making you hot.
Hot is good.

We got to help your spermies
rocket to my egg.

Well, just don't be
upside-down too long.

My sperm get dizzy.

Giggles Ooh!

Shh, shh, shh.

You all packed?

I need a sleeping bag.

Just staple
some sheets together.

This camp's got a rifle range

and woods all around a lake.

I'm definitely
gonna kill something,

like a grizzly,

mountain lion, maybe a tiger.

Or I might just go in the canoe
and shoot some fish.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you,

a world your other siblings
will never get to experience.

But they don't know
that this camp

is only for kids with cancer,
so, like I said before,

you must keep that secret.

Are you still someone
I can trust?

Why am I the only one
who caught cancer from grammy?

Life is rife
with questions that baffle.

All we can do is carry on.

Am I going to die?

Time will tell.

But don't you worry.
I'm working on a cure.

- You all packed up?
- Shh.

- Yup.
- What's Hymie doing here?

I'm baby-sitting.

Oh, is Sheila
popping pills again?

Sheila happens
to think very highly

of my ability to raise
bright, independent children.

You're not leaving
Hymie here, Frank.

Debbie can't take care
of a special needs kid

on top of day care.

Challenges foster growth.

You can't prevent Debbie
from an opportunity to grow.

Not happening.

Carl, what are you doing?

Making a sleeping bag.

- These are Lip's sheets.
- Not anymore.

All right,
take my ROTC sleeping bag, huh?

- Really?
- Yeah.

I'll grab it from upstairs.

Why couldn't you win
a raffle for camp

- when I was little, Frank?
- Fortune dispenses randomly.

I hated camp.

Don't listen to Jamie, Carl.

Jimmy.

You okay holding down the fort

with Debbie's day care insanity
starting up again?

Jamie's got it.
Jamie is all over it.

Okay, little man.
See you in a week.

Laughs

I just want to say
thanks for being a great sister.

I may have never said that,

but now I did.

- You okay, Carl?
- Yeah.

Okay, I left a list of stuff
we need at the store.

You kicking in
for squirrel fund this month?

Absolutely. Yeah.
I'm living here.

Got to do my part.

Don't have to.

"Want."
Want to.

Debbie!
Day care starting!

Wow.
Thanks, Ian.

I got a couple more things
for camp too--

bug spray,
and Swiss army knife.

For comfort and convenience,
not as weapons.

Awesome.

See you in a week, pal.

See ya.

Dad, we should go.

Coming!

Stay away from people
with cancer, little dude.

Okay, who's ready
for breakfast burritos?

Me!

- So this sister...
- Half.

She's just waiting somewhere

for your dad to go pick her up?

Near Milwaukee.

He gonna do it?

No.

So you think maybe,
I don't know,

maybe you should call her,

tell her he's not coming?

No call answers that question

just as good as a call does...

So you're cool with your sister

going in
the foster care system?

Well, the system's
better than here.

Yeah, says the girl who,
miraculously,

has never been in the system.

She have any other relatives?

Who knows?
Look, it sucks,

but there's nothing
I can do about it.

She sounded desperate.

I mean, let's-- let's see
if we could get her.

Let's see if we can help.

- Help how?
- I don't know.

Maybe locate the rest
of her family.

How are we gonna do that?

I don't know, drive up there,
figure it out.

In the car
that neither of us have?

- She's your sister.
- Half.

There's a coupon
in the flyer for this.

- Do you have one?
- I left it at home.

There's a stack of 'em
right over there.

No reason the store
should have that 75 cents.

Adolpho, delivery ready
at register three.

Princess, it's time
for your break.

Princess, stop working so hard.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's not a "break" break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

Will you be coming up
for parents day, Mr. Gallagher?

No. No, no.
Working.

No time to relax.

Being able to afford
Carl's cancer drugs

means a lot of time
at the foundry.

And, if I'm late, I get docked.

I get docked too many times,
I get fired.

If I get fired,
I lose my benefits,

benefits that
will provide treatments

to extend Carl's life

past the doctor's
original dire predictions.

We'll take good care
of him, I promise.

Thank you.

Okay, folks, bus is leaving.

- Get your hugs in.
- Okay, check it out.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

Take one a day.
They'll give you the energy

to get through camp.

Will they cure my cancer?

Depends on your attitude.

I love you, dad.

Okay.
Okay, good.

There you go.
Be brave.

Both: 10, 11, 12,

13...

1, 2, 3...

4, 5...

Ashish, it's not your turn.

What number did I get up to?

5! Or 13.

Whoo!
Yummy time.

It's been a while, hasn't it?

- What has?
- Since we had sex.

Oh, yeah.

Sleep deprivation's
the silent romance killer.

Who thought Frank
would be the cure?

- Jody?
- Yeah.

Would you want to stay here
a little bit?

Oh, you want to snuggle?

Jody's always down
for maximum snuggums.

I was thinking maybe we could

mix into snuggle time

a little toy time?

Sheila, we've been over this.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

It's good to be nervous.

- Not true.
- Please.

Sheila, sweetheart,

I can't, okay?

I like what we have now.

Let's not ruin it.

Breakfast in a sec?

 I've been working
on the railroad

All:  all the livelong day

 I've been working
on the railroad

 just to
 pass the time away

Yo.
I'm Hanley.

Carl. What up?

Not my red blood cell count.

What kind do you got?

The kind that kills kids.
You?

Same.

Fiona, I need you
to trade breaks with me later.

Sure.
When do I punch out?

Bobby'll tell you.

And a little tip
I tell all the new gals,

I don't punch out
when I pull my extra break.

If I'm in the building,
I'm gonna get compensated

for whatever work I do.

Makes sense.

When it's my day, I punch in,

go home, nap,

do shit with my boyfriend,

come back, do Bobby,

go back home,
and still don't punch out.

I have one of the gals
on the late shift

punch me out at close.

Get paid for a double,
and I only work 15 minutes.

Reason I need you to go for me

is 'cause I got a bunch
of canker sores.

I need a break
from the sucky-suck,

if you know what I mean.

Jennica, could I go
for you next week?

I just got my teeth cleaned
at the free clinic,

and the trainee hygienist
just shredded my gums.

Been there.
No worries.

I'll ask Lucy.
I got seniority.

I got the evening Bobby shift,
which is easy-peasy.

By then, basically his dick
is just coughing up smoke.

Pancakes are in the oven.

Great session.

Yummy time, mucho yum.

He looks so happy and peaceful.

If ignorance is bliss,

then Down Syndrome's
got to be euphoria.

How are the pancakes?

Filling.

Do you ever miss
what we used to have?

Your crepes?
Definitely.

Jody's not much of a cook.

I mean, the--

the things
that we would do together.

Our social calendar
was never that full.

No, I mean,

like, the things.

I'm talking about what you and I
used to have in bed.

Oh.

No.

You let me be in charge.
Remember?

Jody only wants

to cuddle and do it
like missionaries.

- Cuddling's good.
- It's boring.

And uneventful.

I need events!

I want eventful play!

- Shh.
- I want to be in charge.

Well, then be in charge.

Be forceful.
Jody's malleable.

He's not.

I've tried.

Would you talk to him?

No.

I have needs, Frank.

I have needs.

I don't think I ask
for too much.

Crying
I don't know what to do.

Oh, no, please don cry

when I'm eating.

Whimpers

I'm sorry.

Just I miss it.

I miss it so, so much.

And the missing makes me sad.

All right, all right.
I'll talk to him.

Really?
You will?

Yes, if you'll stop crying

and let me enjoy
my pancakes, yes.

I can stop crying.
I can stop crying.

I can.
I can stop crying.

Stifled crying

You're visiting a Milkovich
sister nobody's ever heard of

in Milwaukee?

Uh, correct.

And you're gonna do what?

We are going to evaluate
her well-being

and, if need be, rescue her.

You mean kidnap?

Provide transport
to a safer haven.

- Kidnap.
- Rescue.

Bad idea.

Look, a kid's in trouble,

we're gonna help.

Crossing state lines
to bring a minor

back to the Milkovich house
of horror seems more like abuse.

Look, her mother's dead,
she's home alone,

and she's scared.

Welcome
to the predictable consequences

of using crystal meth.

Engine struggles to turn over

Have you ever driven this thing

more than four
consecutive miles?

Revving

Rock music



What's that smell?

Fresh air.

Where's the rifle range?

Don't think we have that
anymore.

Then why's it on the pamphlet?

That is a worthwhile inquiry.

You shouldn't have put it
on the pamphlet

- if you don't have it.
- Well, let's go check.

Come on.

 Without windows



Groans Damn it.

You all right, Lucy?

No, I'm not all right.

I was filling in
for Jennica on her--

I was filling in
for Jennica's Bobby break,

and now I got Bobby juice
on the blouse

that I am wearing
to Cuban Night.

So now Jennica's gonna get

her car keyed,
because I am fed up

with coworkers who always seem

to have canker sore outbreaks
when it's their turn.

Hey, don't forget
to backload those.



 There was a farmer

 who had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 and Bingo was his name-o

You want to sing along
with us, Carl?

I want to shoot a rifle.

Got some info for you
on that one.

We no longer offer
a rifle range.

That's bullshit!

Language, please, Carl.

There's a range
on the pamphlet.

How about I teach you
to play chess?

How about I call Action 4 News
and tell them

you're lying
to a bunch of dying kids

on what they get to do
at this horseshit camp!

I'm sorry, Carl.

I want to go to the forest
and kill something.

Let's find you
something safe to do,

yet still thrilling,

like making
a tie-dyed t-shirt.

You don't have to want it.

Doing things
you don't want to do

is how you make
a relationship work.

I can't, Frank.
I'm sorry.

Sex toys are a gateway choice.

Toys can be mind-expanding.

I just got my one-year chip
from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

Part of my recovery's
to make certain

that I only have
loving, committed sex.

No battery-powered aides
allowed.

She just wants
to kick it up a notch.

Make her happy.

The key
to my continued happiness

is to have loving sex
infrequently.

I've mastered
the infrequent part.

This isn't about
your happiness.

It's about Sheila's.

I finally got my life
back under control.

If I kick it up a notch,

there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

Oh, would you stop bragging?

We're all sex addicts, man.

10, 12 times a day?

What, thinking about it?
Yeah. More.

No, the act.
Arousal and release.

Before I got into SA,

I was having sex
10, 12 times a day.

Giving or receiving?

Never receiving.
I was destroying.

Destroying?

That's what I used to call it.
"Destroying pussy."

You all make coming to work
such a delight.

10, 12 times a day?
The same woman?

Never. That's the thing
about the internet.

Once you announce
your depravity,

there's plenty of other
depravers seeking company.

I mean,
if you put it out there,

you can find a ton
of willing participants

who want to be humiliated
having sex.

I got to re-up
my AOL account.

One week,
I had 32 different partners.

Didn't cost me a dime.

Toys, contraptions,

restraints.

You know,
you start messing around,

you think you're under control,

but eventually you abuse
your arousal center,

needing stranger and stranger
shit to flip your switch.

I mean,

I started to look at sex
like a fight,

and my weapon was my cock.

I knew I really had a problem
when I couldn't get hard

unless I was slapping it
in the face

of a woman who was pretending
she was crying.

I underestimated you, Jody.

In a bar
full of depraved people,

you are the Grand Poobah
of depravity.

Was.

Won't be again.

What do I owe you
for the ginger ale, Kev?

- Vanilla or chocolate?
- Mixed.

You got any rainbow sprinkles?

They discontinued
using sprinkles last summer.

Some brands of food coloring
have been linked to cancer.

I already have cancer.
This camp blows.

No sprinkles?
What is this, Mexico?

We're trying to create
an enjoyable--

Create a way to get some
sprinkles here before we die.

Hey, kids,
it's Moppy the clown.

Cheers

Yo, Carl, way to speak up.

Want to go check out the lake?

Sure.
I'll go ask.

Don't ask.
Just go.

But they'll get mad

if we don't ask permission.

Cancer is our permission.

We've been at this camp

for a whole day
without seeing the lake.

I've never seen a lake before.

- Not even Lake Michigan?
- Where's that?

I didn't get a chance
to swing by the bank today,

but I'll get some money
in the squirrel fund tomorrow.

- I promise, okay?
- Okay.

How'd it go today?

Weird.
Day care?

No kids lost limbs.
No kids were lost by Jim.

Excellent.

How'd cashier work get weird?

I think everyone at work
other than me

is blowing the manager.

That's genius.

Evil genius.

Taking advantage of women

who can't afford
to lose their jobs?

- It's sick.
- Then quit.

I need the job.
Overtime. Benefits.

But eventually,
they're all gonna realize

I'm not carrying
my share of the load.

Literally.

Maybe I can figure out a way
to make 'em all stop

before they realize
I'm getting a free ride.

Yeah, if we stick together,

collectively boycott
giving him what he wants,

maybe it can stop.
There's strength in numbers.

United we stand.
Divided, we keep sucking dick.

Hey, revolutions have begun
with less inspiring phrases.

Cool.

Flat rocks skip better.

They pay for your braces

before or after they found out
you were dying?

I'm not dying.

You got cancer, dude.

You're dying.
We're all dying.

My dad got me
some special pills.

Good luck with that.

Seriously.

They ain't got no cure.

I thought this camp
was supposed to,

you know, like, help kids,
fresh air and that stuff.

The only kids
invited to this camp

are the ones
that ain't gonna make it.

This is the final party.

One final "screw you,"
putting all this cool shit

within arm's reach
and then not letting us do dick.

If you had to pick one wish they
would actually grant, what would it be?

Titties.

Never seen
a real girl's titties.

- Porn?
- Sure.

But never seen titties
in real life.

- You?
- Older sister.

Describe 'em.

Like titties, except their
your older sister's.

You don't really want
to keep looking at 'em.

Bed screeching

- How's that?
- Fine.

- You feeling me?
- Oh, I do.

What's my name?

Have you forgotten your name?

- Say it!
- It.

- My name.
- Jody.

Groans

Car horn blares

Knock at door

Hey, Molly.
It's me, Mandy.

Whoa.
Uh, this is Lip,

- my friend.
- Hey.

Is daddy here?

He's at sea,
but he sends his love.

How are you?

Am I coming home with you?

Um, Molly, did your mom--
did she have, like,

an address book
with family members

from her side of the family?

Cousins or anyone like that?

No.

Okay,
what about her cell phone?

Anyone on that?

She only had two numbers on it.

Daddy's and her dealer's.

You never met
any uncles or aunties?

Just you and my cousin David.

He's in the Navy
and fights bad guys.

But other than him, no.

Are you taking me to daddy?

Ooh, 51 seconds, Debs.

Only 39 seconds to go.

Inhales deeply

Hey, register two.

You having a party?

The ladies'll be
all a-flitter.

Hi.
Patty.

- Deli.
- Hey, Patty. Fiona.

Yeah, just a chance
to mingle away from work.

Coffee, cocktails,
conversation.

Totally casual.

I've been working here
25 years.

No one's ever thrown a party.

Well, it's good to get
to know people

away from the salt mine,
you know?

I don't know, but I'm glad
you're gonna show us.

Want me to bring something?

- We're all set.
- Are you sure?

Something from the deli?

Bobby'd probably give us
a discount.

Or I could throw away some meat

and pick it up
from the dumpster later.

Don't worry.
I'll double-bag it.

I'm just gonna do chips
and salsa, something light.

Well, more room
in my belly for beer.

See you tonight.

Panerai.
Nice.

How nice?

$2,000.

That cost me five
three years ago.

Don't need a pedigree.
Just need an answer.

Clicks tongue

Cell phone ringing

Fuck.

Okay, kids, for lunch,
we have organic chicken,

a fresh kale salad,

and a juice bar
with beets and cukes

and ginger and carrots
ready to be ground down

into their essential goodness.

- Got any chicken nuggets?
- I love chicken nuggets.

Chickie nugs?
I want some.

Sorry, guys.
No chicken nuggets.

- Got a car?
- No.

- I'm a college student.
- Buy one.

People who go to college
are rich.

- I'm not.
- Then go call us a cab

and go get us some nuggets.

I got money.
My mom said I could buy

whatever I want
from the camp store.

I want chicken nuggets.

There's no nuggets
at the camp store.

We're dying of cancer.

Serial killers on death row get
lobster for their final meal.

Any one of these next meals
could be our last.

We can't even get
some chicken nuggets?

We have cancer.

Go get us some nuggets now!

All: Nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets...
Other kids continue chanting

Hanley, I'm gonna get you
to see some real titties.

Not sister titties,
not porn titties.

Just naked, real titties.

Well, I'm off to work.

- Okay.
- Mwah.

Eggs are in the oven, Frank.

You were gonna talk to him.

I did.

Nothing's changed.

Not gonna happen overnight,
Sheila.

I am running out of time.

You're not.

I think we can have

what we had again.

And I would never
cheat on Jody,

but I am ready to ask him

if you and I can have
a little toy time on the side.

We had something special,

but not as special
as you and Jody.

I don't need Jody.
I need you.

Stammers
I-I need you back

because of what you let me feel

by allowing me
to make you feel something

that you don't want to feel.

You brought a girl to my house

without asking me first?

You took me in
when I needed it.

My MS has got real bad.

My whole left side
goes numb for weeks.

I'll help.

Your heart's
in the right place.

You're the best Milkovich
there is.

I should have called first.
I'm sorry.

No, it's not a bad idea, Mandy.

It's a bad time.

I mean, I can't take care
of little kids.

Take her back.

There are good people who work

in the places
that take care of orphans.

She'll be better off.

Could you look after her
while we figure it out?

What are you gonna do

when there's no Aunt Rande
to run to?

And one day, there won't be.

That day is today.

Loving sex
is a rule of my program.

Don't let your emotions
completely obscure

the barbaric roots
of the sexual act.

Don't lose touch with the seeds
of our animal nature.

That's a good thing.
We're not animals.

We're people with the ability

to elevate sex to a spiritual,
loving experience.

You can have that with Sheila

and still give her
what she needs.

That's not been my experience.

You're smarter now.

You're stronger.
You can handle it.

Sheila needs you.

 Boys will be boys

I love her, Frank.
I really do.

Then don't let past regrets

scare you from embracing
new experiences.

It's what it unleashes in me
that I'm afraid of.

Jody, the most important part
of your recovery

is this little family
you've started.

Sheila wants to be sensitive
to your recovery,

but she has needs.

Your acceptance of those needs

is an act of love.

This is love.

You're not breaking
your sobriety.

You're showing her
how much you care.

Hmm.

Ready, Jody.

Right.
What are we doing again?

"Eat at Anne's" with an arrow.

Cool.
Hop on.

Hey.
Where you been?

Hey.
Milwaukee.

- What?
- I love Milwaukee.

- Breweries.
- What's all this?

Party for work.

Hey, Fiona.

Fiona, this is Molly,

Mandy's sister.

Both: You have a sister?

I do.

Hey, Molly, bathroom.

You guys, I'm up to 75 seconds.

- Doing what, Debs?
- Prepping to be drowned

- at the city pool.
- Oh, cool.

Debs, this is Molly,
Mandy's sister.

Can you show her
the bathroom, please?

You have a sister?

Milwaukee?

Look, her mother OD'd,
and she called Mandy.

Uh-huh.
So why are you involved?

He's Captain Chivalry now.

Look, she's a little girl
that needs shelter

while we figure out
the next step.

Can't she just stay here
for a bit?

We're kind of full up.

Not with Carl in camp,
we're not.

Why don't you just take her
to her father's house?

Well, we're not gonna take her
to her father's house

because her father likes
to molest his daughters.

Should have led with that.

Sighs

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

So yes or no?

She can stay
till Carl gets back,

but, Lip, doing shit
like this signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

You sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Cell phone ringing Pop.

Can you meet me for a drink?

Is everything all right?

If everything was all right,

I wouldn't be asking you
to meet me

for a drink on short notice.

Can't you tell me on the phone?

James, just put on
your big-boy pants

and meet your father at a bar

of your choice
so we can mumble, like men,

over a beer.

Note rings out

No.

This is where they lock up
the pain pills.

- We need a bolt cutter.
- No, we don't.

Let's just use
your Swiss army knife

and unscrew the bolts.

Or we can just break the glass.

When I break the glass,
you guys cough

so no one will be suspicious.

One, two, three, cough.
All coughing

What are you kids
doing in here?

We were gonna steal the drugs
and sell them.

Really?
You need to work on your lying.

What do you need money for?

- We want to pay a woman--
- Shut up.

This is a camp that's supposed
to fulfill wishes,

but all you do is say "no."

Sighs

Kids, I came to work here

to do my part
in diminishing the burden

of your illness.

I know you've been disappointed

with some of the restrictions
put on you here.

I wish I had the power
to change that.

You may have more power
than you think.

Frank.

Jody wants to talk to you.

Lively conversation

Ladies, thanks
for getting together

on such short notice.

Oh, who doesn't like a party?

You've all embraced me
at the store,

and I really appreciate it.

And I-I just want to say

that we-- we collectively
have a voice.

All: Yeah!

And we-- we should
start voicing it.

You starting a ladies' choir?

I sing at the church
every Sunday.

I can't sing at all.

No. No.

Ladies, we need to speak
about what's going on at work--

with Bobby.

I, like all of you,

am happy to have a job, okay?

But I don't want this job

if the cost is
a never-ending payback hummer.

I don't want
to live in that world.

It's not right.

Thank God
somebody finally said it.

I've been saying it for months.

But you didn't throw a party.

Laughter

If we band together,

we can put an end to this.

- Yeah.
- An end to hearing your name

- called over the loudspeaker.
- Hello.

An end to him deciding

we're here to please him

whenever the urge arises.

- Right.
- An end to feeling

like we have to give him
whatever he wants.

Like we are
some desperate whores

who are happy
for the attention.

All: Right.

Our jobs are not his
to threaten us with.

- Right.
- Our mouths

are not his property
to use as he pleases.

- Yeah.
- Amen.

I was this close
to biting it off last week.

Laughter

We need to say this stops now.

All: Yeah!
Yes!

It's not that bad.
Silence

What?

I mean, he showers daily,

keeps himself clean.

Last year, when my kid got sick,
he gave me time off.

Says something.

Patty's right.

When I punch in late,
he never dock me.

What's a quick blow job
if, when my kid is sick,

I get to stay home?

- It's sexual harassment.
- Exactly.

He let me take flowers

to put on my mother's grave,
no charge.

He charges you a weekly hummer.

Come on, he lets you take home

week-old carnations
that are already dying.

To hell with his flowers.

It's once a week
for ten minutes.

Stick your finger up his rear

and pop his cork,
you get it done in two.

That's what I would do,

and leave a Lee press on nail
up there.

Laughter

Give him something
to scream about.

Amen, Jennica!
Laughter continues

We're playing
a dangerous game, ladies.

Okay?
Wait, wait.

If we cause a ruckus,
we get him fired,

guess what?

We don't know who
the next manager will be.

What if he doesn't let us
call in sick

when we're really not sick?

What if he doesn't let us
go to a funeral

without punching out?

What if he doesn't let us

take home expired meat
and sheet cakes

and a pony keg
once and again for free?

Bobby's a nice guy.

Okay, okay,
so we have to provide him

with oral pleasure once a week.

- Is that such a bad thing?
All: - Yes!

No, no, no, listen, girls, listen.
Think about it.

The dick we're sucking
may very well be better

than the dick we might have
to suck instead.

Thank God
you're in the minority.

All: Yeah.

- Uh, yeah?
All: - Yeah.

Let's take a vote.

On what?

The situation at hand.

Whether we keep
what's working working.

You want to have a vote?

Hey, you convened
the blow job town hall.

Let's vote.
Yes or no.

Fine.

Show of hands.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Secret ballot.

Let the democratic process
unfold.

Couple of tips...

don't relax.
Pretend you're scared.

She likes that.

I don't have
to pretend, though.

It'll stretch.
Trust me.

If God didn't want us
putting things up our ass,

he would have given the rectum
a gag reflex.

Laughter

So I was thinking
tonight maybe you and Molly

should sleep together.

I'll just bunk
with Ian and Liam.

That way, if she wakes up
in the middle

of the night
and she's freaking out,

- you'll be there.
- All right.

How long?

92 seconds!

Whoo!
Cheers

I'm only doing this for Hanley.

I have cancer too.

Me too.

You're the best friend
I've ever had.

Sighs

Sighs

Now how about the lower half?

Not happening, pal.

Wendy?

Wow.

Exactly how I imagined them
to be.

Okay.

Blow job.

No blow job.

Blow job.

Abstention?

Really, ladies?
One of you is abstaining?

What does that mean?

It means someone doesn't care

one way or another.

I never minded it,
but he never asks me anymore.

That's cause you're
a human piranha, Lois.

And blow jobs win,
six to three.

With one abstention.

That's what I'm talking about.

I want a recount.

Yeah, come on, ladies.

How could this many of you
vote for blow jobs?

Yeah, have the guts
to say who you are.

Patty's right.
It's not that bad.

Lucy, what about your blouse?

Oh, the stain came out.

Admit it, Fiona.
He doesn't taste that bad.

I wouldn't know.
I've never done it.

You're the reason why I had

to pick up an extra hummer
this week?

Pop.

James.

Um...

is this a place you frequent?

Yeah, neighborhood joint.
What's up?

Oh.

Um...

your mother and I

are getting a divorce.

Kev, shots, please.

Okay, I'll just be
down the hall.

You may hear some sirens
and stuff during the night,

but you'll be safe.

Okay, good night.

Good night.

Here you go.

Change of underwear
and a nightgown.

I'll be back
in a second, Molly.

Thanks.

Oh, yeah.
No worries.

Night.

Night.

I will totally teach you
to swim.

We could protect one other
from city kids

who hate white people.

Oh, yeah,
that's just my girl penis.

It looks exactly
like a boy penis.

But I'm a girl,

so it's different.

The incompatibility
finally caught up to us.

When you moving out?

Now, basically.

Basically?

Well, literally.

She, uh...

she changed the locks.

Hmm.

Where are you staying?

A hotel probably.

So how's mom?

Well...

she's fine.

Ah.
I'm being nice.

How's your mother?

Your mother,

she is on the final slope
downward

into the pickle jar.

A pill to rise,
a pill to sleep,

a pill to numb her
throughout the day,

and then Tanqueray
to wash it all down.

She changed the locks.

So be it.

Yeah.

And remember to breathe.

I don't want to do this.

Just keep reminding yourself,

this is love.

Say it with me.
"This is love."

- This is...
- Love.

Both: This is love.

- This is love.
- This is love.

- This is love.
- Exactly.

Okay, Sheils,
you're good to go.

Thanks, Frank.

This is love.

 You know
that you're pure lust



 every girl

 you're meeting

What? Wait, wait, wait, it's not my fault.
I was over-served, okay?

All right, let's just agree
to blame the bartender

and call it a night, okay?

What, you picking up
a little crack first?

This is where I live.

Clatter

Hey, Fiona,
Ian, you've met my father.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Whoa, whoa!
Ian, a little help here?

- Sure, sure.
- Hey, hey, hey.

Yeah, we were at the Alibi.

We had a few.

Well, I'll get a pillow
and a blanket.

All right.

Grunting

Sighs

This one's gonna take.

My boys are gonna hit
your bull's-eye.

- Mm.
- I can feel it.

Come on, boys!

Laughing Swim!

Swim like Michael Phelps!

Swim, baby!

Can a vagina go deaf?

Whoo!

Laughs

My parents
are getting divorced.

- I mean--
- Is that a good thing

- or a bad thing?
- I mean, now we have to spend

more time
with both of them, so...

not good.

Listen, I'm sorry
that I brought him here.

It was just, he was in a state,

and we were right around
the corner, and...

Chuckles

Let's end this day right.

 I spend my whole life
waiting

 for you to say you like

Liquid splashing

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's okay.
I'm done.

 I subjugate my soul

 but I make you feel
all right



 got a young man's libido

 and an old man's mind

 I want to kiss you all over

 I want to make you sweat

 I want to get
into your head

 'cause you're the one
I love

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

What the fuck?

Uh, I was looking
for the shower.

- Who the fuck are you?
- That's Jimmy's dad.

What's going on?
Oh.

Whoa, dad,
where's your clothes?

I was gonna take a shower.
I came into the wrong room.

Yeah, then you hopped up
in my bed with a full chub.

Both: - What?
- Jimmy's dad just tried to go

- balls-deep on me.
- No, man, I didn't--

Then why'd you grab my sack?

All right, cover up.

- Is everything all right?
- Doesn't seem to be.

- Uh, Molly, Debs, back to bed.
- Fuck.

Are you sure?

When you feel a full chub

poking you in the back,
the meaning's pretty clear.

Ned was looking for me.

I met him at a club.

We've been hooking up
for a while.

You've been screwing
Jimmy's dad?

I didn't know he
was Jimmy's dad at the time.

He's nice.

Yeah.

Is this why mom kicked you out?

What?

No.
No. No.

Does she know that you're...

gay?

I'm not so much gay as...

Sometimes I enjoy men
more than women, you know?

No, no, it's not that.

I-I'm broke, son.

Financially.

Broke.

That's why she threw me out.

That's...

not the only reason,

but most of it.

I'm sorry about in there.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

No, it was the wrong bed.

It's the other kid.

Ian.

I'll be at the Four Seasons.

I think I still have
a credit card that works.

I'm so sorry.

If I had to apologize
for all the stuff

my father's done,
I wouldn't have a voice left.

Mm.

Hard rock music



Sobbing

They were really nice.

Sobbing





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

Gasps How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Beep Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Grunts Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck

it's not for naught

 You were beaming

 What is this downside

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends

Fuck you, Gallagher.

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

Ahh.

Sighs

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

Knock at door

I--
Exhales

Doin' some work on
the sewer main in a couple days,

just wanted to warn ya.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Chains rattling

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--
Stammering

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

It's good for us to grow...

as people.

Toilet flushing

Shower's free.
Who's next?

Growls

Hey!

She's not even related to us.

Go pee downstairs.
Go.

Urinating

How long do you plan
on keeping Molly around?

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

Sniffs

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

Sniffs

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Chuckles
Here you go. Good doggy.

Exhales

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Knock at door Incoming.

Rock music

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.
Sniffs

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

Brendan Benson's
The Light Of Day



 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day



You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Indistinct distant chatter

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

Pounding upstairs

Chuckles You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

Knock at door

Panting

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

Laughs

Baby crying

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

Sighs
I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

Baby crying

Door opens

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Sighs
Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Sighs

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

Door opens

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

Clank We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

Rock music



You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!
Coughs

Aah!



Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.



Ah, good work.

Knock at door

Baby crying

Get your act together, lady.

Sighs

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

where Ginger was,
it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

Sighs

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Door shuts

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Clatter upstairs Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

Drill whirring

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Drilling

Sighs Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

Crying I've never had
so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

Take Me Out To The Coast
by Waters



 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

Sighs

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.



 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Laughs

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Gunshots

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.
Gunshot

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Gunshots

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.
Gunshot

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

Gunshots

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Ice cream truck chimes

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Toilet flushes

Exhales

Really, ladies?

Really funny.
Knocking

Phone line trilling

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

Rock music

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings



Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.



It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

All murmuring
What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

Sparse chuckles

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Laughter

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

Cooing

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Broom sweeping

Grunts

Aah. Jesus.
Grunts

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Door opens

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Crying

Knock at door Debbie?

Sobs It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.
Crying

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Crying

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Deep breath

Crying

Come on.

Sobs

We gotta dig.

Rock music _



Gasps _

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?



You have been blogging
about me every day?

Grunts

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Explosion Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

Car alarm blaring

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Chuckles Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

Chuckles

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Not much in there.

Jeez, Kevin.

Exhales Okay.

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Lighter clicks

licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Voicemail beeps

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Sighs

Sighs

Chuckles

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

Sighs

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Giggles

Both moaning

Fuck.

Metal clanking

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

Yeah. What?

For those of you who were doing

open-heart surgery or bringing

you were doing,

on Shameless last week.

Get your goddamn ass
out of this bed!

It's your fucking turn!

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

Hymie has his first well baby
appointment today.

I'll take him.

Nice place you got here.

- What are you doing here?
- I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips
and a ginger snap.

- Can I help you?
- This is my son, Hymie.

Our organization
works with dying children.

Of course.
I know that.

It's my other child
that's dying.

Carl.
Carl.

- A word.
- Cancer?

You said you cater
to dying children.

Camp?

I've never been to camp.

Here he comes.

Hey, thanks for bailing me out.

All Mandy.

She used her dad's
line of credit

at Bad Bob's bonds.

Mandy.
Bein' smart?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Excuse me.
I was thinking

there might be a job opening.

Tell me, Fiona.

How do you feel
about deli meats?

Are you saying that,
if I blow you,

I can have a job?

Hey, V, do you still have

that mini camera you use
for titty shots?

He's right in there.
Do you know what you're doing?

I got it all on tape.
He's nasty.

I want day shifts,

 you're so sure of?

- Stay. Stay.
- How long was that?

Not long enough.
You need at least 90 seconds.

City pools are filled
with city kids,

and by "city kids"
I mean black kids who swim.

Little stereotype-breakers,

like those two kids that ripped
your bathing suit last year.

They were turning it
into a bikini.

If they'll do that
when you're just running

through the sprinklers
at your own house,

think what they'll do
when they have

a large body of water
at their disposal.

Savage little cosby kids

will drown your ass.

Times have changed.

Yeah, that's what they said

when they were holding me
underwater repeatedly

in the summer of '67,

the so-called
summer of love.

Not at the Sullivan Street pool,
it wasn't.

It was the summer
of drowning whitey.

And until you can hold
your breath

longer than they can hold
their breath,

you're not going
to Sullivan Street.

Sighs Go.

Whoa, can I try?

No, Carl, you've got cancer.

Pack your bag.
We're leaving.

Half.

Want to finish?

Moans

Oh, you've been working
on your Kegels.

Oh.
Oh, you're flexing this.

Moans Oh, you're flexing,

oh, you're flexing that.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Exclaims

Roll over, Hulk Hogan.

Both groaning

You want me to finish you off?

I'm good, hon. We got to save
your sperm for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

You cool?

Yeah.

Yeah, it just--
I just wish you had given me

a heads-up before I went
with the whole whore thing.

You know, I don't want
our kid's first impression

of you to be
that you're a whore.

It was making you hot.
Hot is good.

We got to help your spermies
rocket to my egg.

Well, just don't be
upside-down too long.

My sperm get dizzy.

Giggles Ooh!

Shh, shh, shh.

You all packed?

I need a sleeping bag.

Just staple
some sheets together.

This camp's got a rifle range

and woods all around a lake.

I'm definitely
gonna kill something,

like a grizzly,

mountain lion, maybe a tiger.

Or I might just go in the canoe
and shoot some fish.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you,

a world your other siblings
will never get to experience.

But they don't know
that this camp

is only for kids with cancer,
so, like I said before,

you must keep that secret.

Are you still someone
I can trust?

Why am I the only one
who caught cancer from grammy?

Life is rife
with questions that baffle.

All we can do is carry on.

Am I going to die?

Time will tell.

But don't you worry.
I'm working on a cure.

- You all packed up?
- Shh.

- Yup.
- What's Hymie doing here?

I'm baby-sitting.

Oh, is Sheila
popping pills again?

Sheila happens
to think very highly

of my ability to raise
bright, independent children.

You're not leaving
Hymie here, Frank.

Debbie can't take care
of a special needs kid

on top of day care.

Challenges foster growth.

You can't prevent Debbie
from an opportunity to grow.

Not happening.

Carl, what are you doing?

Making a sleeping bag.

- These are Lip's sheets.
- Not anymore.

All right,
take my ROTC sleeping bag, huh?

- Really?
- Yeah.

I'll grab it from upstairs.

Why couldn't you win
a raffle for camp

- when I was little, Frank?
- Fortune dispenses randomly.

I hated camp.

Don't listen to Jamie, Carl.

Jimmy.

You okay holding down the fort

with Debbie's day care insanity
starting up again?

Jamie's got it.
Jamie is all over it.

Okay, little man.
See you in a week.

Laughs

I just want to say
thanks for being a great sister.

I may have never said that,

but now I did.

- You okay, Carl?
- Yeah.

Okay, I left a list of stuff
we need at the store.

You kicking in
for squirrel fund this month?

Absolutely. Yeah.
I'm living here.

Got to do my part.

Don't have to.

"Want."
Want to.

Debbie!
Day care starting!

Wow.
Thanks, Ian.

I got a couple more things
for camp too--

bug spray,
and Swiss army knife.

For comfort and convenience,
not as weapons.

Awesome.

See you in a week, pal.

See ya.

Dad, we should go.

Coming!

Stay away from people
with cancer, little dude.

Okay, who's ready
for breakfast burritos?

Me!

- So this sister...
- Half.

She's just waiting somewhere

for your dad to go pick her up?

Near Milwaukee.

He gonna do it?

No.

So you think maybe,
I don't know,

maybe you should call her,

tell her he's not coming?

No call answers that question

just as good as a call does...

So you're cool with your sister

going in
the foster care system?

Well, the system's
better than here.

Yeah, says the girl who,
miraculously,

has never been in the system.

She have any other relatives?

Who knows?
Look, it sucks,

but there's nothing
I can do about it.

She sounded desperate.

I mean, let's-- let's see
if we could get her.

Let's see if we can help.

- Help how?
- I don't know.

Maybe locate the rest
of her family.

How are we gonna do that?

I don't know, drive up there,
figure it out.

In the car
that neither of us have?

- She's your sister.
- Half.

There's a coupon
in the flyer for this.

- Do you have one?
- I left it at home.

There's a stack of 'em
right over there.

No reason the store
should have that 75 cents.

Adolpho, delivery ready
at register three.

Princess, it's time
for your break.

Princess, stop working so hard.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's not a "break" break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

Will you be coming up
for parents day, Mr. Gallagher?

No. No, no.
Working.

No time to relax.

Being able to afford
Carl's cancer drugs

means a lot of time
at the foundry.

And, if I'm late, I get docked.

I get docked too many times,
I get fired.

If I get fired,
I lose my benefits,

benefits that
will provide treatments

to extend Carl's life

past the doctor's
original dire predictions.

We'll take good care
of him, I promise.

Thank you.

Okay, folks, bus is leaving.

- Get your hugs in.
- Okay, check it out.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

Take one a day.
They'll give you the energy

to get through camp.

Will they cure my cancer?

Depends on your attitude.

I love you, dad.

Okay.
Okay, good.

There you go.
Be brave.

Both: 10, 11, 12,

13...

1, 2, 3...

4, 5...

Ashish, it's not your turn.

What number did I get up to?

5! Or 13.

Whoo!
Yummy time.

It's been a while, hasn't it?

- What has?
- Since we had sex.

Oh, yeah.

Sleep deprivation's
the silent romance killer.

Who thought Frank
would be the cure?

- Jody?
- Yeah.

Would you want to stay here
a little bit?

Oh, you want to snuggle?

Jody's always down
for maximum snuggums.

I was thinking maybe we could

mix into snuggle time

a little toy time?

Sheila, we've been over this.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

It's good to be nervous.

- Not true.
- Please.

Sheila, sweetheart,

I can't, okay?

I like what we have now.

Let's not ruin it.

Breakfast in a sec?

 I've been working
on the railroad

All:  all the livelong day

 I've been working
on the railroad

 just to
 pass the time away

Yo.
I'm Hanley.

Carl. What up?

Not my red blood cell count.

What kind do you got?

The kind that kills kids.
You?

Same.

Fiona, I need you
to trade breaks with me later.

Sure.
When do I punch out?

Bobby'll tell you.

And a little tip
I tell all the new gals,

I don't punch out
when I pull my extra break.

If I'm in the building,
I'm gonna get compensated

for whatever work I do.

Makes sense.

When it's my day, I punch in,

go home, nap,

do shit with my boyfriend,

come back, do Bobby,

go back home,
and still don't punch out.

I have one of the gals
on the late shift

punch me out at close.

Get paid for a double,
and I only work 15 minutes.

Reason I need you to go for me

is 'cause I got a bunch
of canker sores.

I need a break
from the sucky-suck,

if you know what I mean.

Jennica, could I go
for you next week?

I just got my teeth cleaned
at the free clinic,

and the trainee hygienist
just shredded my gums.

Been there.
No worries.

I'll ask Lucy.
I got seniority.

I got the evening Bobby shift,
which is easy-peasy.

By then, basically his dick
is just coughing up smoke.

Pancakes are in the oven.

Great session.

Yummy time, mucho yum.

He looks so happy and peaceful.

If ignorance is bliss,

then Down Syndrome's
got to be euphoria.

How are the pancakes?

Filling.

Do you ever miss
what we used to have?

Your crepes?
Definitely.

Jody's not much of a cook.

I mean, the--

the things
that we would do together.

Our social calendar
was never that full.

No, I mean,

like, the things.

I'm talking about what you and I
used to have in bed.

Oh.

No.

You let me be in charge.
Remember?

Jody only wants

to cuddle and do it
like missionaries.

- Cuddling's good.
- It's boring.

And uneventful.

I need events!

I want eventful play!

- Shh.
- I want to be in charge.

Well, then be in charge.

Be forceful.
Jody's malleable.

He's not.

I've tried.

Would you talk to him?

No.

I have needs, Frank.

I have needs.

I don't think I ask
for too much.

Crying
I don't know what to do.

Oh, no, please don cry

when I'm eating.

Whimpers

I'm sorry.

Just I miss it.

I miss it so, so much.

And the missing makes me sad.

All right, all right.
I'll talk to him.

Really?
You will?

Yes, if you'll stop crying

and let me enjoy
my pancakes, yes.

I can stop crying.
I can stop crying.

I can.
I can stop crying.

Stifled crying

You're visiting a Milkovich
sister nobody's ever heard of

in Milwaukee?

Uh, correct.

And you're gonna do what?

We are going to evaluate
her well-being

and, if need be, rescue her.

You mean kidnap?

Provide transport
to a safer haven.

- Kidnap.
- Rescue.

Bad idea.

Look, a kid's in trouble,

we're gonna help.

Crossing state lines
to bring a minor

back to the Milkovich house
of horror seems more like abuse.

Look, her mother's dead,
she's home alone,

and she's scared.

Welcome
to the predictable consequences

of using crystal meth.

Engine struggles to turn over

Have you ever driven this thing

more than four
consecutive miles?

Revving

Rock music



What's that smell?

Fresh air.

Where's the rifle range?

Don't think we have that
anymore.

Then why's it on the pamphlet?

That is a worthwhile inquiry.

You shouldn't have put it
on the pamphlet

- if you don't have it.
- Well, let's go check.

Come on.

 Without windows



Groans Damn it.

You all right, Lucy?

No, I'm not all right.

I was filling in
for Jennica on her--

I was filling in
for Jennica's Bobby break,

and now I got Bobby juice
on the blouse

that I am wearing
to Cuban Night.

So now Jennica's gonna get

her car keyed,
because I am fed up

with coworkers who always seem

to have canker sore outbreaks
when it's their turn.

Hey, don't forget
to backload those.



 There was a farmer

 who had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 and Bingo was his name-o

You want to sing along
with us, Carl?

I want to shoot a rifle.

Got some info for you
on that one.

We no longer offer
a rifle range.

That's bullshit!

Language, please, Carl.

There's a range
on the pamphlet.

How about I teach you
to play chess?

How about I call Action 4 News
and tell them

you're lying
to a bunch of dying kids

on what they get to do
at this horseshit camp!

I'm sorry, Carl.

I want to go to the forest
and kill something.

Let's find you
something safe to do,

yet still thrilling,

like making
a tie-dyed t-shirt.

You don't have to want it.

Doing things
you don't want to do

is how you make
a relationship work.

I can't, Frank.
I'm sorry.

Sex toys are a gateway choice.

Toys can be mind-expanding.

I just got my one-year chip
from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

Part of my recovery's
to make certain

that I only have
loving, committed sex.

No battery-powered aides
allowed.

She just wants
to kick it up a notch.

Make her happy.

The key
to my continued happiness

is to have loving sex
infrequently.

I've mastered
the infrequent part.

This isn't about
your happiness.

It's about Sheila's.

I finally got my life
back under control.

If I kick it up a notch,

there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

Oh, would you stop bragging?

We're all sex addicts, man.

10, 12 times a day?

What, thinking about it?
Yeah. More.

No, the act.
Arousal and release.

Before I got into SA,

I was having sex
10, 12 times a day.

Giving or receiving?

Never receiving.
I was destroying.

Destroying?

That's what I used to call it.
"Destroying pussy."

You all make coming to work
such a delight.

10, 12 times a day?
The same woman?

Never. That's the thing
about the internet.

Once you announce
your depravity,

there's plenty of other
depravers seeking company.

I mean,
if you put it out there,

you can find a ton
of willing participants

who want to be humiliated
having sex.

I got to re-up
my AOL account.

One week,
I had 32 different partners.

Didn't cost me a dime.

Toys, contraptions,

restraints.

You know,
you start messing around,

you think you're under control,

but eventually you abuse
your arousal center,

needing stranger and stranger
shit to flip your switch.

I mean,

I started to look at sex
like a fight,

and my weapon was my cock.

I knew I really had a problem
when I couldn't get hard

unless I was slapping it
in the face

of a woman who was pretending
she was crying.

I underestimated you, Jody.

In a bar
full of depraved people,

you are the Grand Poobah
of depravity.

Was.

Won't be again.

What do I owe you
for the ginger ale, Kev?

- Vanilla or chocolate?
- Mixed.

You got any rainbow sprinkles?

They discontinued
using sprinkles last summer.

Some brands of food coloring
have been linked to cancer.

I already have cancer.
This camp blows.

No sprinkles?
What is this, Mexico?

We're trying to create
an enjoyable--

Create a way to get some
sprinkles here before we die.

Hey, kids,
it's Moppy the clown.

Cheers

Yo, Carl, way to speak up.

Want to go check out the lake?

Sure.
I'll go ask.

Don't ask.
Just go.

But they'll get mad

if we don't ask permission.

Cancer is our permission.

We've been at this camp

for a whole day
without seeing the lake.

I've never seen a lake before.

- Not even Lake Michigan?
- Where's that?

I didn't get a chance
to swing by the bank today,

but I'll get some money
in the squirrel fund tomorrow.

- I promise, okay?
- Okay.

How'd it go today?

Weird.
Day care?

No kids lost limbs.
No kids were lost by Jim.

Excellent.

How'd cashier work get weird?

I think everyone at work
other than me

is blowing the manager.

That's genius.

Evil genius.

Taking advantage of women

who can't afford
to lose their jobs?

- It's sick.
- Then quit.

I need the job.
Overtime. Benefits.

But eventually,
they're all gonna realize

I'm not carrying
my share of the load.

Literally.

Maybe I can figure out a way
to make 'em all stop

before they realize
I'm getting a free ride.

Yeah, if we stick together,

collectively boycott
giving him what he wants,

maybe it can stop.
There's strength in numbers.

United we stand.
Divided, we keep sucking dick.

Hey, revolutions have begun
with less inspiring phrases.

Cool.

Flat rocks skip better.

They pay for your braces

before or after they found out
you were dying?

I'm not dying.

You got cancer, dude.

You're dying.
We're all dying.

My dad got me
some special pills.

Good luck with that.

Seriously.

They ain't got no cure.

I thought this camp
was supposed to,

you know, like, help kids,
fresh air and that stuff.

The only kids
invited to this camp

are the ones
that ain't gonna make it.

This is the final party.

One final "screw you,"
putting all this cool shit

within arm's reach
and then not letting us do dick.

If you had to pick one wish they
would actually grant, what would it be?

Titties.

Never seen
a real girl's titties.

- Porn?
- Sure.

But never seen titties
in real life.

- You?
- Older sister.

Describe 'em.

Like titties, except their
your older sister's.

You don't really want
to keep looking at 'em.

Bed screeching

- How's that?
- Fine.

- You feeling me?
- Oh, I do.

What's my name?

Have you forgotten your name?

- Say it!
- It.

- My name.
- Jody.

Groans

Car horn blares

Knock at door

Hey, Molly.
It's me, Mandy.

Whoa.
Uh, this is Lip,

- my friend.
- Hey.

Is daddy here?

He's at sea,
but he sends his love.

How are you?

Am I coming home with you?

Um, Molly, did your mom--
did she have, like,

an address book
with family members

from her side of the family?

Cousins or anyone like that?

No.

Okay,
what about her cell phone?

Anyone on that?

She only had two numbers on it.

Daddy's and her dealer's.

You never met
any uncles or aunties?

Just you and my cousin David.

He's in the Navy
and fights bad guys.

But other than him, no.

Are you taking me to daddy?

Ooh, 51 seconds, Debs.

Only 39 seconds to go.

Inhales deeply

Hey, register two.

You having a party?

The ladies'll be
all a-flitter.

Hi.
Patty.

- Deli.
- Hey, Patty. Fiona.

Yeah, just a chance
to mingle away from work.

Coffee, cocktails,
conversation.

Totally casual.

I've been working here
25 years.

No one's ever thrown a party.

Well, it's good to get
to know people

away from the salt mine,
you know?

I don't know, but I'm glad
you're gonna show us.

Want me to bring something?

- We're all set.
- Are you sure?

Something from the deli?

Bobby'd probably give us
a discount.

Or I could throw away some meat

and pick it up
from the dumpster later.

Don't worry.
I'll double-bag it.

I'm just gonna do chips
and salsa, something light.

Well, more room
in my belly for beer.

See you tonight.

Panerai.
Nice.

How nice?

$2,000.

That cost me five
three years ago.

Don't need a pedigree.
Just need an answer.

Clicks tongue

Cell phone ringing

Fuck.

Okay, kids, for lunch,
we have organic chicken,

a fresh kale salad,

and a juice bar
with beets and cukes

and ginger and carrots
ready to be ground down

into their essential goodness.

- Got any chicken nuggets?
- I love chicken nuggets.

Chickie nugs?
I want some.

Sorry, guys.
No chicken nuggets.

- Got a car?
- No.

- I'm a college student.
- Buy one.

People who go to college
are rich.

- I'm not.
- Then go call us a cab

and go get us some nuggets.

I got money.
My mom said I could buy

whatever I want
from the camp store.

I want chicken nuggets.

There's no nuggets
at the camp store.

We're dying of cancer.

Serial killers on death row get
lobster for their final meal.

Any one of these next meals
could be our last.

We can't even get
some chicken nuggets?

We have cancer.

Go get us some nuggets now!

All: Nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets...
Other kids continue chanting

Hanley, I'm gonna get you
to see some real titties.

Not sister titties,
not porn titties.

Just naked, real titties.

Well, I'm off to work.

- Okay.
- Mwah.

Eggs are in the oven, Frank.

You were gonna talk to him.

I did.

Nothing's changed.

Not gonna happen overnight,
Sheila.

I am running out of time.

You're not.

I think we can have

what we had again.

And I would never
cheat on Jody,

but I am ready to ask him

if you and I can have
a little toy time on the side.

We had something special,

but not as special
as you and Jody.

I don't need Jody.
I need you.

Stammers
I-I need you back

because of what you let me feel

by allowing me
to make you feel something

that you don't want to feel.

You brought a girl to my house

without asking me first?

You took me in
when I needed it.

My MS has got real bad.

My whole left side
goes numb for weeks.

I'll help.

Your heart's
in the right place.

You're the best Milkovich
there is.

I should have called first.
I'm sorry.

No, it's not a bad idea, Mandy.

It's a bad time.

I mean, I can't take care
of little kids.

Take her back.

There are good people who work

in the places
that take care of orphans.

She'll be better off.

Could you look after her
while we figure it out?

What are you gonna do

when there's no Aunt Rande
to run to?

And one day, there won't be.

That day is today.

Loving sex
is a rule of my program.

Don't let your emotions
completely obscure

the barbaric roots
of the sexual act.

Don't lose touch with the seeds
of our animal nature.

That's a good thing.
We're not animals.

We're people with the ability

to elevate sex to a spiritual,
loving experience.

You can have that with Sheila

and still give her
what she needs.

That's not been my experience.

You're smarter now.

You're stronger.
You can handle it.

Sheila needs you.

 Boys will be boys

I love her, Frank.
I really do.

Then don't let past regrets

scare you from embracing
new experiences.

It's what it unleashes in me
that I'm afraid of.

Jody, the most important part
of your recovery

is this little family
you've started.

Sheila wants to be sensitive
to your recovery,

but she has needs.

Your acceptance of those needs

is an act of love.

This is love.

You're not breaking
your sobriety.

You're showing her
how much you care.

Hmm.

Ready, Jody.

Right.
What are we doing again?

"Eat at Anne's" with an arrow.

Cool.
Hop on.

Hey.
Where you been?

Hey.
Milwaukee.

- What?
- I love Milwaukee.

- Breweries.
- What's all this?

Party for work.

Hey, Fiona.

Fiona, this is Molly,

Mandy's sister.

Both: You have a sister?

I do.

Hey, Molly, bathroom.

You guys, I'm up to 75 seconds.

- Doing what, Debs?
- Prepping to be drowned

- at the city pool.
- Oh, cool.

Debs, this is Molly,
Mandy's sister.

Can you show her
the bathroom, please?

You have a sister?

Milwaukee?

Look, her mother OD'd,
and she called Mandy.

Uh-huh.
So why are you involved?

He's Captain Chivalry now.

Look, she's a little girl
that needs shelter

while we figure out
the next step.

Can't she just stay here
for a bit?

We're kind of full up.

Not with Carl in camp,
we're not.

Why don't you just take her
to her father's house?

Well, we're not gonna take her
to her father's house

because her father likes
to molest his daughters.

Should have led with that.

Sighs

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

So yes or no?

She can stay
till Carl gets back,

but, Lip, doing shit
like this signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

You sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Cell phone ringing Pop.

Can you meet me for a drink?

Is everything all right?

If everything was all right,

I wouldn't be asking you
to meet me

for a drink on short notice.

Can't you tell me on the phone?

James, just put on
your big-boy pants

and meet your father at a bar

of your choice
so we can mumble, like men,

over a beer.

Note rings out

No.

This is where they lock up
the pain pills.

- We need a bolt cutter.
- No, we don't.

Let's just use
your Swiss army knife

and unscrew the bolts.

Or we can just break the glass.

When I break the glass,
you guys cough

so no one will be suspicious.

One, two, three, cough.
All coughing

What are you kids
doing in here?

We were gonna steal the drugs
and sell them.

Really?
You need to work on your lying.

What do you need money for?

- We want to pay a woman--
- Shut up.

This is a camp that's supposed
to fulfill wishes,

but all you do is say "no."

Sighs

Kids, I came to work here

to do my part
in diminishing the burden

of your illness.

I know you've been disappointed

with some of the restrictions
put on you here.

I wish I had the power
to change that.

You may have more power
than you think.

Frank.

Jody wants to talk to you.

Lively conversation

Ladies, thanks
for getting together

on such short notice.

Oh, who doesn't like a party?

You've all embraced me
at the store,

and I really appreciate it.

And I-I just want to say

that we-- we collectively
have a voice.

All: Yeah!

And we-- we should
start voicing it.

You starting a ladies' choir?

I sing at the church
every Sunday.

I can't sing at all.

No. No.

Ladies, we need to speak
about what's going on at work--

with Bobby.

I, like all of you,

am happy to have a job, okay?

But I don't want this job

if the cost is
a never-ending payback hummer.

I don't want
to live in that world.

It's not right.

Thank God
somebody finally said it.

I've been saying it for months.

But you didn't throw a party.

Laughter

If we band together,

we can put an end to this.

- Yeah.
- An end to hearing your name

- called over the loudspeaker.
- Hello.

An end to him deciding

we're here to please him

whenever the urge arises.

- Right.
- An end to feeling

like we have to give him
whatever he wants.

Like we are
some desperate whores

who are happy
for the attention.

All: Right.

Our jobs are not his
to threaten us with.

- Right.
- Our mouths

are not his property
to use as he pleases.

- Yeah.
- Amen.

I was this close
to biting it off last week.

Laughter

We need to say this stops now.

All: Yeah!
Yes!

It's not that bad.
Silence

What?

I mean, he showers daily,

keeps himself clean.

Last year, when my kid got sick,
he gave me time off.

Says something.

Patty's right.

When I punch in late,
he never dock me.

What's a quick blow job
if, when my kid is sick,

I get to stay home?

- It's sexual harassment.
- Exactly.

He let me take flowers

to put on my mother's grave,
no charge.

He charges you a weekly hummer.

Come on, he lets you take home

week-old carnations
that are already dying.

To hell with his flowers.

It's once a week
for ten minutes.

Stick your finger up his rear

and pop his cork,
you get it done in two.

That's what I would do,

and leave a Lee press on nail
up there.

Laughter

Give him something
to scream about.

Amen, Jennica!
Laughter continues

We're playing
a dangerous game, ladies.

Okay?
Wait, wait.

If we cause a ruckus,
we get him fired,

guess what?

We don't know who
the next manager will be.

What if he doesn't let us
call in sick

when we're really not sick?

What if he doesn't let us
go to a funeral

without punching out?

What if he doesn't let us

take home expired meat
and sheet cakes

and a pony keg
once and again for free?

Bobby's a nice guy.

Okay, okay,
so we have to provide him

with oral pleasure once a week.

- Is that such a bad thing?
All: - Yes!

No, no, no, listen, girls, listen.
Think about it.

The dick we're sucking
may very well be better

than the dick we might have
to suck instead.

Thank God
you're in the minority.

All: Yeah.

- Uh, yeah?
All: - Yeah.

Let's take a vote.

On what?

The situation at hand.

Whether we keep
what's working working.

You want to have a vote?

Hey, you convened
the blow job town hall.

Let's vote.
Yes or no.

Fine.

Show of hands.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Secret ballot.

Let the democratic process
unfold.

Couple of tips...

don't relax.
Pretend you're scared.

She likes that.

I don't have
to pretend, though.

It'll stretch.
Trust me.

If God didn't want us
putting things up our ass,

he would have given the rectum
a gag reflex.

Laughter

So I was thinking
tonight maybe you and Molly

should sleep together.

I'll just bunk
with Ian and Liam.

That way, if she wakes up
in the middle

of the night
and she's freaking out,

- you'll be there.
- All right.

How long?

92 seconds!

Whoo!
Cheers

I'm only doing this for Hanley.

I have cancer too.

Me too.

You're the best friend
I've ever had.

Sighs

Sighs

Now how about the lower half?

Not happening, pal.

Wendy?

Wow.

Exactly how I imagined them
to be.

Okay.

Blow job.

No blow job.

Blow job.

Abstention?

Really, ladies?
One of you is abstaining?

What does that mean?

It means someone doesn't care

one way or another.

I never minded it,
but he never asks me anymore.

That's cause you're
a human piranha, Lois.

And blow jobs win,
six to three.

With one abstention.

That's what I'm talking about.

I want a recount.

Yeah, come on, ladies.

How could this many of you
vote for blow jobs?

Yeah, have the guts
to say who you are.

Patty's right.
It's not that bad.

Lucy, what about your blouse?

Oh, the stain came out.

Admit it, Fiona.
He doesn't taste that bad.

I wouldn't know.
I've never done it.

You're the reason why I had

to pick up an extra hummer
this week?

Pop.

James.

Um...

is this a place you frequent?

Yeah, neighborhood joint.
What's up?

Oh.

Um...

your mother and I

are getting a divorce.

Kev, shots, please.

Okay, I'll just be
down the hall.

You may hear some sirens
and stuff during the night,

but you'll be safe.

Okay, good night.

Good night.

Here you go.

Change of underwear
and a nightgown.

I'll be back
in a second, Molly.

Thanks.

Oh, yeah.
No worries.

Night.

Night.

I will totally teach you
to swim.

We could protect one other
from city kids

who hate white people.

Oh, yeah,
that's just my girl penis.

It looks exactly
like a boy penis.

But I'm a girl,

so it's different.

The incompatibility
finally caught up to us.

When you moving out?

Now, basically.

Basically?

Well, literally.

She, uh...

she changed the locks.

Hmm.

Where are you staying?

A hotel probably.

So how's mom?

Well...

she's fine.

Ah.
I'm being nice.

How's your mother?

Your mother,

she is on the final slope
downward

into the pickle jar.

A pill to rise,
a pill to sleep,

a pill to numb her
throughout the day,

and then Tanqueray
to wash it all down.

She changed the locks.

So be it.

Yeah.

And remember to breathe.

I don't want to do this.

Just keep reminding yourself,

this is love.

Say it with me.
"This is love."

- This is...
- Love.

Both: This is love.

- This is love.
- This is love.

- This is love.
- Exactly.

Okay, Sheils,
you're good to go.

Thanks, Frank.

This is love.

 You know
that you're pure lust



 every girl

 you're meeting

What? Wait, wait, wait, it's not my fault.
I was over-served, okay?

All right, let's just agree
to blame the bartender

and call it a night, okay?

What, you picking up
a little crack first?

This is where I live.

Clatter

Hey, Fiona,
Ian, you've met my father.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Whoa, whoa!
Ian, a little help here?

- Sure, sure.
- Hey, hey, hey.

Yeah, we were at the Alibi.

We had a few.

Well, I'll get a pillow
and a blanket.

All right.

Grunting

Sighs

This one's gonna take.

My boys are gonna hit
your bull's-eye.

- Mm.
- I can feel it.

Come on, boys!

Laughing Swim!

Swim like Michael Phelps!

Swim, baby!

Can a vagina go deaf?

Whoo!

Laughs

My parents
are getting divorced.

- I mean--
- Is that a good thing

- or a bad thing?
- I mean, now we have to spend

more time
with both of them, so...

not good.

Listen, I'm sorry
that I brought him here.

It was just, he was in a state,

and we were right around
the corner, and...

Chuckles

Let's end this day right.

 I spend my whole life
waiting

 for you to say you like

Liquid splashing

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's okay.
I'm done.

 I subjugate my soul

 but I make you feel
all right



 got a young man's libido

 and an old man's mind

 I want to kiss you all over

 I want to make you sweat

 I want to get
into your head

 'cause you're the one
I love

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

What the fuck?

Uh, I was looking
for the shower.

- Who the fuck are you?
- That's Jimmy's dad.

What's going on?
Oh.

Whoa, dad,
where's your clothes?

I was gonna take a shower.
I came into the wrong room.

Yeah, then you hopped up
in my bed with a full chub.

Both: - What?
- Jimmy's dad just tried to go

- balls-deep on me.
- No, man, I didn't--

Then why'd you grab my sack?

All right, cover up.

- Is everything all right?
- Doesn't seem to be.

- Uh, Molly, Debs, back to bed.
- Fuck.

Are you sure?

When you feel a full chub

poking you in the back,
the meaning's pretty clear.

Ned was looking for me.

I met him at a club.

We've been hooking up
for a while.

You've been screwing
Jimmy's dad?

I didn't know he
was Jimmy's dad at the time.

He's nice.

Yeah.

Is this why mom kicked you out?

What?

No.
No. No.

Does she know that you're...

gay?

I'm not so much gay as...

Sometimes I enjoy men
more than women, you know?

No, no, it's not that.

I-I'm broke, son.

Financially.

Broke.

That's why she threw me out.

That's...

not the only reason,

but most of it.

I'm sorry about in there.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

No, it was the wrong bed.

It's the other kid.

Ian.

I'll be at the Four Seasons.

I think I still have
a credit card that works.

I'm so sorry.

If I had to apologize
for all the stuff

my father's done,
I wouldn't have a voice left.

Mm.

Hard rock music



Sobbing

They were really nice.

Sobbing





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

Gasps How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Beep Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Grunts Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck

it's not for naught

 You were beaming

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends

El Camino's Lawd Have Mercy

Fuck you, Gallagher.

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

Ahh.

Sighs

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

Knock at door

I--
Exhales

Doin' some work on
the sewer main in a couple days,

just wanted to warn ya.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Chains rattling

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--
Stammering

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

It's good for us to grow...

as people.

Toilet flushing

Shower's free.
Who's next?

Growls

Hey!

She's not even related to us.

Go pee downstairs.
Go.

Urinating

How long do you plan
on keeping Molly around?

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

Sniffs

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

Sniffs

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Chuckles
Here you go. Good doggy.

Exhales

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Knock at door Incoming.

Rock music

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.
Sniffs

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

Brendan Benson's
The Light Of Day



 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day



You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Indistinct distant chatter

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

Pounding upstairs

Chuckles You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

Knock at door

Panting

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

Laughs

Baby crying

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

Sighs
I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

Baby crying

Door opens

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Sighs
Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Sighs

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

Door opens

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Jackhammering

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Jackhammering

Electric buzzing

Sparks

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

Clank We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

Rock music



You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!
Coughs

Aah!



Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?
Laughs

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.



Ah, good work.

Knock at door

Baby crying

Get your act together, lady.

Sighs

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

where Ginger was,
it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

Sighs

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Door shuts

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Clatter upstairs Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

Drill whirring

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Drilling

Sighs Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

Crying I've never had
so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

Take Me Out To The Coast
by Waters



 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

Sighs

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.



 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Laughs

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Gunshots

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.
Gunshot

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Gunshots

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.
Gunshot

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

Gunshots

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Ice cream truck chimes

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Toilet flushes

Exhales

Really, ladies?

Really funny.
Knocking

Phone line trilling

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

Rock music

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings



Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.



It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

All murmuring
What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

Sparse chuckles

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Laughter

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

Cooing

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Broom sweeping

Grunts

Aah. Jesus.
Grunts

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Door opens

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Crying

Knock at door Debbie?

Sobs It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.
Crying

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Crying

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Deep breath

Crying

Come on.

Sobs

We gotta dig.

Rock music _



Gasps _

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?



You have been blogging
about me every day?

Grunts

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Explosion Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

Car alarm blaring

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Chuckles Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

Chuckles

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Slapping

Not much in there.

We could've used an eyedropper.

Jeez, Kevin.

Exhales Okay.

Ooh. Laughs

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Lighter clicks

Don't worry about your dweeb.

He's just off
licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Phone line trilling

Voicemail beeps

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Sighs

Sighs

Chuckles

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

Sighs

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Giggles

Both moaning

Fuck.

Metal clanking

I'm a dick!

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

Can you come down?

Dog barks

Hey.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

Fireworks squealing

Hey. Whoa.

I totally almost drowned
a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

until she passed out!

Oh, my God.
Guess what.

You do not "F"

Chuckles Don't "F" with me.

Debs.

Yeah. What?

For those of you who were doing

open-heart surgery or bringing
peace to the Mid-East

or whatever the fuck
you were doing,

this is what you missed
on Shameless last week.

Baby crying It's your turn.

Get your goddamn ass
out of this bed!

It's your fucking turn!

Nanny Frank to the rescue.

Hymie has his first well baby
appointment today.

I'll take him.

Nice place you got here.

- What are you doing here?
- I was hungry.

So you drove all the way
to the South Side

for a bag of chips?

Well, a bag of chips
and a ginger snap.

- Can I help you?
- This is my son, Hymie.

Our organization
works with dying children.

Of course.
I know that.

It's my other child
that's dying.

Carl.
Carl.

- A word.
- Cancer?

You said you cater
to dying children.

Camp?

I've never been to camp.

Here he comes.

Hey, thanks for bailing me out.

All Mandy.

She used her dad's
line of credit

at Bad Bob's bonds.

Mandy.
Bein' smart?

Tell your girlfriend
to wear clothes, Lip.

Excuse me.
I was thinking

there might be a job opening.

Tell me, Fiona.

How do you feel
about deli meats?

Are you saying that,
if I blow you,

I can have a job?

Hey, V, do you still have

that mini camera you use
for titty shots?

He's right in there.
Do you know what you're doing?

I got it all on tape.
He's nasty.

I want day shifts,
home by 6:00.

Stay down.

Stay down!

- Stay. Stay.
- How long was that?

Not long enough.
You need at least 90 seconds.

City pools are filled
with city kids,

and by "city kids"
I mean black kids who swim.

Little stereotype-breakers,

like those two kids that ripped
your bathing suit last year.

They were turning it
into a bikini.

If they'll do that
when you're just running

through the sprinklers
at your own house,

think what they'll do
when they have

a large body of water
at their disposal.

Savage little cosby kids

will drown your ass.

Times have changed.

Yeah, that's what they said

when they were holding me
underwater repeatedly

in the summer of '67,

the so-called
summer of love.

Not at the Sullivan Street pool,
it wasn't.

It was the summer
of drowning whitey.

And until you can hold
your breath

longer than they can hold
their breath,

you're not going
to Sullivan Street.

Sighs Go.

Whoa, can I try?

No, Carl, you've got cancer.

Pack your bag.
We're leaving.

Half.

Want to finish?

unbelievably tasty right now.

I just wish you had given me

a heads-up before I went
with the whole whore thing.

You know, I don't want
our kid's first impression

of you to be
that you're a whore.

It was making you hot.
Hot is good.

We got to help your spermies
rocket to my egg.

Well, just don't be
upside-down too long.

My sperm get dizzy.

Giggles Ooh!

Shh, shh, shh.

You all packed?

I need a sleeping bag.

Just staple
some sheets together.

This camp's got a rifle range

and woods all around a lake.

I'm definitely
gonna kill something,

like a grizzly,

mountain lion, maybe a tiger.

Or I might just go in the canoe
and shoot some fish.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you,

a world your other siblings
will never get to experience.

But they don't know
that this camp

is only for kids with cancer,
so, like I said before,

you must keep that secret.

Are you still someone
I can trust?

Why am I the only one
who caught cancer from grammy?

Life is rife
with questions that baffle.

All we can do is carry on.

Am I going to die?

Time will tell.

But don't you worry.
I'm working on a cure.

- You all packed up?
- Shh.

- Yup.
- What's Hymie doing here?

I'm baby-sitting.

Oh, is Sheila
popping pills again?

Sheila happens
to think very highly

of my ability to raise
bright, independent children.

You're not leaving
Hymie here, Frank.

Debbie can't take care
of a special needs kid

on top of day care.

Challenges foster growth.

You can't prevent Debbie
from an opportunity to grow.

Not happening.

Carl, what are you doing?

Making a sleeping bag.

- These are Lip's sheets.
- Not anymore.

All right,
take my ROTC sleeping bag, huh?

- Really?
- Yeah.

I'll grab it from upstairs.

Why couldn't you win
a raffle for camp

- when I was little, Frank?
- Fortune dispenses randomly.

I hated camp.

Don't listen to Jamie, Carl.

Jimmy.

You okay holding down the fort

with Debbie's day care insanity
starting up again?

Jamie's got it.
Jamie is all over it.

Okay, little man.
See you in a week.

Laughs

I just want to say
thanks for being a great sister.

I may have never said that,

but now I did.

- You okay, Carl?
- Yeah.

Okay, I left a list of stuff
we need at the store.

You kicking in
for squirrel fund this month?

Absolutely. Yeah.
I'm living here.

Got to do my part.

Don't have to.

"Want."
Want to.

Debbie!
Day care starting!

Wow.
Thanks, Ian.

I got a couple more things
for camp too--

bug spray,
and Swiss army knife.

For comfort and convenience,
not as weapons.

Awesome.

See you in a week, pal.

See ya.

Dad, we should go.

Coming!

Stay away from people
with cancer, little dude.

Okay, who's ready
for breakfast burritos?

Me!

- So this sister...
- Half.

She's just waiting somewhere

for your dad to go pick her up?

Near Milwaukee.

He gonna do it?

No.

So you think maybe,
I don't know,

maybe you should call her,

tell her he's not coming?

No call answers that question

just as good as a call does...

So you're cool with your sister

going in
the foster care system?

Well, the system's
better than here.

Yeah, says the girl who,
miraculously,

has never been in the system.

She have any other relatives?

Who knows?
Look, it sucks,

but there's nothing
I can do about it.

She sounded desperate.

I mean, let's-- let's see
if we could get her.

Let's see if we can help.

- Help how?
- I don't know.

Maybe locate the rest
of her family.

How are we gonna do that?

I don't know, drive up there,
figure it out.

In the car
that neither of us have?

- She's your sister.
- Half.

There's a coupon
in the flyer for this.

- Do you have one?
- I left it at home.

There's a stack of 'em
right over there.

No reason the store
should have that 75 cents.

Adolpho, delivery ready
at register three.

Princess, it's time
for your break.

Princess, stop working so hard.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's not a "break" break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

Will you be coming up
for parents day, Mr. Gallagher?

No. No, no.
Working.

No time to relax.

Being able to afford
Carl's cancer drugs

means a lot of time
at the foundry.

And, if I'm late, I get docked.

I get docked too many times,
I get fired.

If I get fired,
I lose my benefits,

benefits that
will provide treatments

to extend Carl's life

past the doctor's
original dire predictions.

We'll take good care
of him, I promise.

Thank you.

Okay, folks, bus is leaving.

- Get your hugs in.
- Okay, check it out.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

Take one a day.
They'll give you the energy

to get through camp.

Will they cure my cancer?

Depends on your attitude.

I love you, dad.

Okay.
Okay, good.

There you go.
Be brave.

Both: 10, 11, 12,

13...

1, 2, 3...

4, 5...

Ashish, it's not your turn.

What number did I get up to?

5! Or 13.

Whoo!
Yummy time.

It's been a while, hasn't it?

- What has?
- Since we had sex.

Oh, yeah.

Sleep deprivation's
the silent romance killer.

Who thought Frank
would be the cure?

- Jody?
- Yeah.

Would you want to stay here
a little bit?

Oh, you want to snuggle?

Jody's always down
for maximum snuggums.

I was thinking maybe we could

mix into snuggle time

a little toy time?

Sheila, we've been over this.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

It's good to be nervous.

- Not true.
- Please.

Sheila, sweetheart,

I can't, okay?

I like what we have now.

Let's not ruin it.

Breakfast in a sec?

 I've been working
on the railroad

All:  all the livelong day

 I've been working
on the railroad

 just to
 pass the time away

Yo.
I'm Hanley.

Carl. What up?

Not my red blood cell count.

What kind do you got?

The kind that kills kids.
You?

Same.

Fiona, I need you
to trade breaks with me later.

Sure.
When do I punch out?

Bobby'll tell you.

And a little tip
I tell all the new gals,

I don't punch out
when I pull my extra break.

If I'm in the building,
I'm gonna get compensated

for whatever work I do.

Makes sense.

When it's my day, I punch in,

go home, nap,

do shit with my boyfriend,

come back, do Bobby,

go back home,
and still don't punch out.

I have one of the gals
on the late shift

punch me out at close.

Get paid for a double,
and I only work 15 minutes.

Reason I need you to go for me

is 'cause I got a bunch
of canker sores.

I need a break
from the sucky-suck,

if you know what I mean.

Jennica, could I go
for you next week?

I just got my teeth cleaned
at the free clinic,

and the trainee hygienist
just shredded my gums.

Been there.
No worries.

I'll ask Lucy.
I got seniority.

I got the evening Bobby shift,
which is easy-peasy.

By then, basically his dick
is just coughing up smoke.

Pancakes are in the oven.

Great session.

Yummy time, mucho yum.

He looks so happy and peaceful.

If ignorance is bliss,

then Down Syndrome's
got to be euphoria.

How are the pancakes?

Filling.

Do you ever miss
what we used to have?

Your crepes?
Definitely.

Jody's not much of a cook.

I mean, the--

the things
that we would do together.

Our social calendar
was never that full.

No, I mean,

like, the things.

I'm talking about what you and I
used to have in bed.

Oh.

No.

You let me be in charge.
Remember?

Jody only wants

to cuddle and do it
like missionaries.

- Cuddling's good.
- It's boring.

And uneventful.

I need events!

I want eventful play!

- Shh.
- I want to be in charge.

Well, then be in charge.

Be forceful.
Jody's malleable.

He's not.

I've tried.

Would you talk to him?

No.

I have needs, Frank.

I have needs.

I don't think I ask
for too much.

Crying
I don't know what to do.

Oh, no, please don cry

when I'm eating.

Whimpers

I'm sorry.

Just I miss it.

I miss it so, so much.

And the missing makes me sad.

All right, all right.
I'll talk to him.

Really?
You will?

Yes, if you'll stop crying

and let me enjoy
my pancakes, yes.

I can stop crying.
I can stop crying.

I can.
I can stop crying.

Stifled crying

You're visiting a Milkovich
sister nobody's ever heard of

in Milwaukee?

Uh, correct.

And you're gonna do what?

We are going to evaluate
her well-being

and, if need be, rescue her.

You mean kidnap?

Provide transport
to a safer haven.

- Kidnap.
- Rescue.

Bad idea.

Look, a kid's in trouble,

we're gonna help.

Crossing state lines
to bring a minor

back to the Milkovich house
of horror seems more like abuse.

Look, her mother's dead,
she's home alone,

and she's scared.

Welcome
to the predictable consequences

of using crystal meth.

Engine struggles to turn over

Have you ever driven this thing

more than four
consecutive miles?

Revving

Rock music



What's that smell?

Fresh air.

Where's the rifle range?

Don't think we have that
anymore.

Then why's it on the pamphlet?

That is a worthwhile inquiry.

You shouldn't have put it
on the pamphlet

- if you don't have it.
- Well, let's go check.

Come on.

 Without windows



Groans Damn it.

You all right, Lucy?

No, I'm not all right.

I was filling in
for Jennica on her--

I was filling in
for Jennica's Bobby break,

and now I got Bobby juice
on the blouse

that I am wearing
to Cuban Night.

So now Jennica's gonna get

her car keyed,
because I am fed up

with coworkers who always seem

to have canker sore outbreaks
when it's their turn.

Hey, don't forget
to backload those.



 There was a farmer

 who had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 B-I-N-G-O

 and Bingo was his name-o

You want to sing along
with us, Carl?

I want to shoot a rifle.

Got some info for you
on that one.

We no longer offer
a rifle range.

That's bullshit!

Language, please, Carl.

There's a range
on the pamphlet.

How about I teach you
to play chess?

How about I call Action 4 News
and tell them

you're lying
to a bunch of dying kids

on what they get to do
at this horseshit camp!

I'm sorry, Carl.

I want to go to the forest
and kill something.

Let's find you
something safe to do,

yet still thrilling,

like making
a tie-dyed t-shirt.

You don't have to want it.

Doing things
you don't want to do

is how you make
a relationship work.

I can't, Frank.
I'm sorry.

Sex toys are a gateway choice.

Toys can be mind-expanding.

I just got my one-year chip
from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

Part of my recovery's
to make certain

that I only have
loving, committed sex.

No battery-powered aides
allowed.

She just wants
to kick it up a notch.

Make her happy.

The key
to my continued happiness

is to have loving sex
infrequently.

I've mastered
the infrequent part.

This isn't about
your happiness.

It's about Sheila's.

I finally got my life
back under control.

If I kick it up a notch,

there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

Oh, would you stop bragging?

We're all sex addicts, man.

10, 12 times a day?

What, thinking about it?
Yeah. More.

No, the act.
Arousal and release.

Before I got into SA,

I was having sex
10, 12 times a day.

Giving or receiving?

Never receiving.
I was destroying.

Destroying?

That's what I used to call it.
"Destroying pussy."

You all make coming to work
such a delight.

10, 12 times a day?
The same woman?

Never. That's the thing
about the internet.

Once you announce
your depravity,

there's plenty of other
depravers seeking company.

I mean,
if you put it out there,

you can find a ton
of willing participants

who want to be humiliated
having sex.

I got to re-up
my AOL account.

One week,
I had 32 different partners.

Didn't cost me a dime.

Toys, contraptions,

restraints.

You know,
you start messing around,

you think you're under control,

but eventually you abuse
your arousal center,

needing stranger and stranger
shit to flip your switch.

I mean,

I started to look at sex
like a fight,

and my weapon was my cock.

I knew I really had a problem
when I couldn't get hard

unless I was slapping it
in the face

of a woman who was pretending
she was crying.

I underestimated you, Jody.

In a bar
full of depraved people,

you are the Grand Poobah
of depravity.

Was.

Won't be again.

What do I owe you
for the ginger ale, Kev?

- Vanilla or chocolate?
- Mixed.

You got any rainbow sprinkles?

They discontinued
using sprinkles last summer.

Some brands of food coloring
have been linked to cancer.

I already have cancer.
This camp blows.

No sprinkles?
What is this, Mexico?

We're trying to create
an enjoyable--

Create a way to get some
sprinkles here before we die.

Hey, kids,
it's Moppy the clown.

Cheers

Yo, Carl, way to speak up.

Want to go check out the lake?

Sure.
I'll go ask.

Don't ask.
Just go.

But they'll get mad

if we don't ask permission.

Cancer is our permission.

We've been at this camp

for a whole day
without seeing the lake.

I've never seen a lake before.

- Not even Lake Michigan?
- Where's that?

I didn't get a chance
to swing by the bank today,

but I'll get some money
in the squirrel fund tomorrow.

- I promise, okay?
- Okay.

How'd it go today?

Weird.
Day care?

No kids lost limbs.
No kids were lost by Jim.

Excellent.

How'd cashier work get weird?

I think everyone at work
other than me

is blowing the manager.

That's genius.

Evil genius.

Taking advantage of women

who can't afford
to lose their jobs?

- It's sick.
- Then quit.

I need the job.
Overtime. Benefits.

But eventually,
they're all gonna realize

I'm not carrying
my share of the load.

Literally.

Maybe I can figure out a way
to make 'em all stop

before they realize
I'm getting a free ride.

Yeah, if we stick together,

collectively boycott
giving him what he wants,

maybe it can stop.
There's strength in numbers.

United we stand.
Divided, we keep sucking dick.

Hey, revolutions have begun
with less inspiring phrases.

Cool.

Flat rocks skip better.

They pay for your braces

before or after they found out
you were dying?

I'm not dying.

You got cancer, dude.

You're dying.
We're all dying.

My dad got me
some special pills.

Good luck with that.

Seriously.

They ain't got no cure.

I thought this camp
was supposed to,

you know, like, help kids,
fresh air and that stuff.

The only kids
invited to this camp

are the ones
that ain't gonna make it.

This is the final party.

One final "screw you,"
putting all this cool shit

within arm's reach
and then not letting us do dick.

If you had to pick one wish they
would actually grant, what would it be?

Titties.

Never seen
a real girl's titties.

- Porn?
- Sure.

But never seen titties
in real life.

- You?
- Older sister.

Describe 'em.

Like titties, except their
your older sister's.

You don't really want
to keep looking at 'em.

Bed screeching

- How's that?
- Fine.

- You feeling me?
- Oh, I do.

What's my name?

Have you forgotten your name?

- Say it!
- It.

- My name.
- Jody.

Groans

Car horn blares

Knock at door

Hey, Molly.
It's me, Mandy.

Whoa.
Uh, this is Lip,

- my friend.
- Hey.

Is daddy here?

He's at sea,
but he sends his love.

How are you?

Am I coming home with you?

Um, Molly, did your mom--
did she have, like,

an address book
with family members

from her side of the family?

Cousins or anyone like that?

No.

Okay,
what about her cell phone?

Anyone on that?

She only had two numbers on it.

Daddy's and her dealer's.

You never met
any uncles or aunties?

Just you and my cousin David.

He's in the Navy
and fights bad guys.

But other than him, no.

Are you taking me to daddy?

Ooh, 51 seconds, Debs.

Only 39 seconds to go.

Inhales deeply

Hey, register two.

You having a party?

The ladies'll be
all a-flitter.

Hi.
Patty.

- Deli.
- Hey, Patty. Fiona.

Yeah, just a chance
to mingle away from work.

Coffee, cocktails,
conversation.

Totally casual.

I've been working here
25 years.

No one's ever thrown a party.

Well, it's good to get
to know people

away from the salt mine,
you know?

I don't know, but I'm glad
you're gonna show us.

Want me to bring something?

- We're all set.
- Are you sure?

Something from the deli?

Bobby'd probably give us
a discount.

Or I could throw away some meat

and pick it up
from the dumpster later.

Don't worry.
I'll double-bag it.

I'm just gonna do chips
and salsa, something light.

Well, more room
in my belly for beer.

See you tonight.

Panerai.
Nice.

How nice?

$2,000.

That cost me five
three years ago.

Don't need a pedigree.
Just need an answer.

Clicks tongue

Cell phone ringing

Fuck.

Okay, kids, for lunch,
we have organic chicken,

a fresh kale salad,

and a juice bar
with beets and cukes

and ginger and carrots
ready to be ground down

into their essential goodness.

- Got any chicken nuggets?
- I love chicken nuggets.

Chickie nugs?
I want some.

Sorry, guys.
No chicken nuggets.

- Got a car?
- No.

- I'm a college student.
- Buy one.

People who go to college
are rich.

- I'm not.
- Then go call us a cab

and go get us some nuggets.

I got money.
My mom said I could buy

whatever I want
from the camp store.

I want chicken nuggets.

There's no nuggets
at the camp store.

We're dying of cancer.

Serial killers on death row get
lobster for their final meal.

Any one of these next meals
could be our last.

We can't even get
some chicken nuggets?

We have cancer.

Go get us some nuggets now!

All: Nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets, nuggets, nuggets,

nuggets...
Other kids continue chanting

Hanley, I'm gonna get you
to see some real titties.

Not sister titties,
not porn titties.

Just naked, real titties.

Well, I'm off to work.

- Okay.
- Mwah.

Eggs are in the oven, Frank.

You were gonna talk to him.

I did.

Nothing's changed.

Not gonna happen overnight,
Sheila.

I am running out of time.

You're not.

I think we can have

what we had again.

And I would never
cheat on Jody,

but I am ready to ask him

if you and I can have
a little toy time on the side.

We had something special,

but not as special
as you and Jody.

I don't need Jody.
I need you.

Stammers
I-I need you back

because of what you let me feel

by allowing me
to make you feel something

that you don't want to feel.

You brought a girl to my house

without asking me first?

You took me in
when I needed it.

My MS has got real bad.

My whole left side
goes numb for weeks.

I'll help.

Your heart's
in the right place.

You're the best Milkovich
there is.

I should have called first.
I'm sorry.

No, it's not a bad idea, Mandy.

It's a bad time.

I mean, I can't take care
of little kids.

Take her back.

There are good people who work

in the places
that take care of orphans.

She'll be better off.

Could you look after her
while we figure it out?

What are you gonna do

when there's no Aunt Rande
to run to?

And one day, there won't be.

That day is today.

Loving sex
is a rule of my program.

Don't let your emotions
completely obscure

the barbaric roots
of the sexual act.

Don't lose touch with the seeds
of our animal nature.

That's a good thing.
We're not animals.

We're people with the ability

to elevate sex to a spiritual,
loving experience.

You can have that with Sheila

and still give her
what she needs.

That's not been my experience.

You're smarter now.

You're stronger.
You can handle it.

Sheila needs you.

 Boys will be boys

I love her, Frank.
I really do.

Then don't let past regrets

scare you from embracing
new experiences.

It's what it unleashes in me
that I'm afraid of.

Jody, the most important part
of your recovery

is this little family
you've started.

Sheila wants to be sensitive
to your recovery,

but she has needs.

Your acceptance of those needs

is an act of love.

This is love.

You're not breaking
your sobriety.

You're showing her
how much you care.

Hmm.

Ready, Jody.

Right.
What are we doing again?

"Eat at Anne's" with an arrow.

Cool.
Hop on.

Hey.
Where you been?

Hey.
Milwaukee.

- What?
- I love Milwaukee.

- Breweries.
- What's all this?

Party for work.

Hey, Fiona.

Fiona, this is Molly,

Mandy's sister.

Both: You have a sister?

I do.

Hey, Molly, bathroom.

You guys, I'm up to 75 seconds.

- Doing what, Debs?
- Prepping to be drowned

- at the city pool.
- Oh, cool.

Debs, this is Molly,
Mandy's sister.

Can you show her
the bathroom, please?

You have a sister?

Milwaukee?

Look, her mother OD'd,
and she called Mandy.

Uh-huh.
So why are you involved?

He's Captain Chivalry now.

Look, she's a little girl
that needs shelter

while we figure out
the next step.

Can't she just stay here
for a bit?

We're kind of full up.

Not with Carl in camp,
we're not.

Why don't you just take her
to her father's house?

Well, we're not gonna take her
to her father's house

because her father likes
to molest his daughters.

Should have led with that.

Sighs

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

So yes or no?

She can stay
till Carl gets back,

but, Lip, doing shit
like this signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

You sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Cell phone ringing Pop.

Can you meet me for a drink?

Is everything all right?

If everything was all right,

I wouldn't be asking you
to meet me

for a drink on short notice.

Can't you tell me on the phone?

James, just put on
your big-boy pants

and meet your father at a bar

of your choice
so we can mumble, like men,

over a beer.

Note rings out

No.

This is where they lock up
the pain pills.

- We need a bolt cutter.
- No, we don't.

Let's just use
your Swiss army knife

and unscrew the bolts.

Or we can just break the glass.

When I break the glass,
you guys cough

so no one will be suspicious.

One, two, three, cough.
All coughing

What are you kids
doing in here?

We were gonna steal the drugs
and sell them.

Really?
You need to work on your lying.

What do you need money for?

- We want to pay a woman--
- Shut up.

This is a camp that's supposed
to fulfill wishes,

but all you do is say "no."

Sighs

Kids, I came to work here

to do my part
in diminishing the burden

of your illness.

I know you've been disappointed

with some of the restrictions
put on you here.

I wish I had the power
to change that.

You may have more power
than you think.

Frank.

Jody wants to talk to you.

Lively conversation

Ladies, thanks
for getting together

on such short notice.

Oh, who doesn't like a party?

You've all embraced me
at the store,

and I really appreciate it.

And I-I just want to say

that we-- we collectively
have a voice.

All: Yeah!

And we-- we should
start voicing it.

You starting a ladies' choir?

I sing at the church
every Sunday.

I can't sing at all.

No. No.

Ladies, we need to speak
about what's going on at work--

with Bobby.

I, like all of you,

am happy to have a job, okay?

But I don't want this job

if the cost is
a never-ending payback hummer.

I don't want
to live in that world.

It's not right.

Thank God
somebody finally said it.

I've been saying it for months.

But you didn't throw a party.

Laughter

If we band together,

we can put an end to this.

- Yeah.
- An end to hearing your name

- called over the loudspeaker.
- Hello.

An end to him deciding

we're here to please him

whenever the urge arises.

- Right.
- An end to feeling

like we have to give him
whatever he wants.

Like we are
some desperate whores

who are happy
for the attention.

All: Right.

Our jobs are not his
to threaten us with.

- Right.
- Our mouths

are not his property
to use as he pleases.

- Yeah.
- Amen.

I was this close
to biting it off last week.

Laughter

We need to say this stops now.

All: Yeah!
Yes!

It's not that bad.
Silence

What?

I mean, he showers daily,

keeps himself clean.

Last year, when my kid got sick,
he gave me time off.

Says something.

Patty's right.

When I punch in late,
he never dock me.

What's a quick blow job
if, when my kid is sick,

I get to stay home?

- It's sexual harassment.
- Exactly.

He let me take flowers

to put on my mother's grave,
no charge.

He charges you a weekly hummer.

Come on, he lets you take home

week-old carnations
that are already dying.

To hell with his flowers.

It's once a week
for ten minutes.

Stick your finger up his rear

and pop his cork,
you get it done in two.

That's what I would do,

and leave a Lee press on nail
up there.

Laughter

Give him something
to scream about.

Amen, Jennica!
Laughter continues

We're playing
a dangerous game, ladies.

Okay?
Wait, wait.

If we cause a ruckus,
we get him fired,

guess what?

We don't know who
the next manager will be.

What if he doesn't let us
call in sick

when we're really not sick?

What if he doesn't let us
go to a funeral

without punching out?

What if he doesn't let us

take home expired meat
and sheet cakes

and a pony keg
once and again for free?

Bobby's a nice guy.

Okay, okay,
so we have to provide him

with oral pleasure once a week.

- Is that such a bad thing?
All: - Yes!

No, no, no, listen, girls, listen.
Think about it.

The dick we're sucking
may very well be better

than the dick we might have
to suck instead.

Thank God
you're in the minority.

All: Yeah.

- Uh, yeah?
All: - Yeah.

Let's take a vote.

On what?

The situation at hand.

Whether we keep
what's working working.

You want to have a vote?

Hey, you convened
the blow job town hall.

Let's vote.
Yes or no.

Fine.

Show of hands.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Secret ballot.

Let the democratic process
unfold.

Couple of tips...

don't relax.
Pretend you're scared.

She likes that.

I don't have
to pretend, though.

It'll stretch.
Trust me.

If God didn't want us
putting things up our ass,

he would have given the rectum
a gag reflex.

Laughter

So I was thinking
tonight maybe you and Molly

should sleep together.

I'll just bunk
with Ian and Liam.

That way, if she wakes up
in the middle

of the night
and she's freaking out,

- you'll be there.
- All right.

How long?

92 seconds!

Whoo!
Cheers

I'm only doing this for Hanley.

I have cancer too.

Me too.

You're the best friend
I've ever had.

Sighs

Sighs

Now how about the lower half?

Not happening, pal.

Wendy?

Wow.

Exactly how I imagined them
to be.

Okay.

Blow job.

No blow job.

Blow job.

Abstention?

Really, ladies?
One of you is abstaining?

What does that mean?

It means someone doesn't care

one way or another.

I never minded it,
but he never asks me anymore.

That's cause you're
a human piranha, Lois.

And blow jobs win,
six to three.

With one abstention.

That's what I'm talking about.

I want a recount.

Yeah, come on, ladies.

How could this many of you
vote for blow jobs?

Yeah, have the guts
to say who you are.

Patty's right.
It's not that bad.

Lucy, what about your blouse?

Oh, the stain came out.

Admit it, Fiona.
He doesn't taste that bad.

I wouldn't know.
I've never done it.

You're the reason why I had

to pick up an extra hummer
this week?

Pop.

James.

Um...

is this a place you frequent?

Yeah, neighborhood joint.
What's up?

Oh.

Um...

your mother and I

are getting a divorce.

Kev, shots, please.

Okay, I'll just be
down the hall.

You may hear some sirens
and stuff during the night,

but you'll be safe.

Okay, good night.

Good night.

Here you go.

Change of underwear
and a nightgown.

I'll be back
in a second, Molly.

Thanks.

Oh, yeah.
No worries.

Night.

Night.

I will totally teach you
to swim.

We could protect one other
from city kids

who hate white people.

Oh, yeah,
that's just my girl penis.

It looks exactly
like a boy penis.

But I'm a girl,

so it's different.

The incompatibility
finally caught up to us.

When you moving out?

Now, basically.

Basically?

Well, literally.

She, uh...

she changed the locks.

Hmm.

Where are you staying?

A hotel probably.

So how's mom?

Well...

she's fine.

Ah.
I'm being nice.

How's your mother?

Your mother,

she is on the final slope
downward

into the pickle jar.

A pill to rise,
a pill to sleep,

a pill to numb her
throughout the day,

and then Tanqueray
to wash it all down.

She changed the locks.

So be it.

Yeah.

And remember to breathe.

I don't want to do this.

Just keep reminding yourself,

this is love.

Say it with me.
"This is love."

- This is...
- Love.

Both: This is love.

- This is love.
- This is love.

- This is love.
- Exactly.

Okay, Sheils,
you're good to go.

Thanks, Frank.

This is love.

 You know
that you're pure lust



 every girl

 you're meeting

What? Wait, wait, wait, it's not my fault.
I was over-served, okay?

All right, let's just agree
to blame the bartender

and call it a night, okay?

What, you picking up
a little crack first?

This is where I live.

Clatter

Hey, Fiona,
Ian, you've met my father.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Whoa, whoa!
Ian, a little help here?

- Sure, sure.
- Hey, hey, hey.

Yeah, we were at the Alibi.

We had a few.

Well, I'll get a pillow
and a blanket.

All right.

Grunting

Sighs

This one's gonna take.

My boys are gonna hit
your bull's-eye.

- Mm.
- I can feel it.

Come on, boys!

Laughing Swim!

Swim like Michael Phelps!

Swim, baby!

Can a vagina go deaf?

Whoo!

Laughs

My parents
are getting divorced.

- I mean--
- Is that a good thing

- or a bad thing?
- I mean, now we have to spend

more time
with both of them, so...

not good.

Listen, I'm sorry
that I brought him here.

It was just, he was in a state,

and we were right around
the corner, and...

Chuckles

Let's end this day right.

 I spend my whole life
waiting

 for you to say you like

Liquid splashing

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's okay.
I'm done.

 I subjugate my soul

 but I make you feel
all right



 got a young man's libido

 and an old man's mind

 I want to kiss you all over

 I want to make you sweat

 I want to get
into your head

 'cause you're the one
I love

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

What the fuck?

Uh, I was looking
for the shower.

- Who the fuck are you?
- That's Jimmy's dad.

What's going on?
Oh.

Whoa, dad,
where's your clothes?

I was gonna take a shower.
I came into the wrong room.

Yeah, then you hopped up
in my bed with a full chub.

Both: - What?
- Jimmy's dad just tried to go

- balls-deep on me.
- No, man, I didn't--

Then why'd you grab my sack?

All right, cover up.

- Is everything all right?
- Doesn't seem to be.

- Uh, Molly, Debs, back to bed.
- Fuck.

Are you sure?

When you feel a full chub

poking you in the back,
the meaning's pretty clear.

Ned was looking for me.

I met him at a club.

We've been hooking up
for a while.

You've been screwing
Jimmy's dad?

I didn't know he
was Jimmy's dad at the time.

He's nice.

Yeah.

Is this why mom kicked you out?

What?

No.
No. No.

Does she know that you're...

gay?

I'm not so much gay as...

Sometimes I enjoy men
more than women, you know?

No, no, it's not that.

I-I'm broke, son.

Financially.

Broke.

That's why she threw me out.

That's...

not the only reason,

but most of it.

I'm sorry about in there.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

No, it was the wrong bed.

It's the other kid.

Ian.

I'll be at the Four Seasons.

I think I still have
a credit card that works.

I'm so sorry.

If I had to apologize
for all the stuff

my father's done,
I wouldn't have a voice left.

Mm.

Hard rock music



Sobbing

They were really nice.

Sobbing





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

Gasps How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Beep Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Grunts Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck

it's not for naught

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Fuck you, Gallagher.

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

Ahh.

Sighs

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

Knock at door

I--
Exhales

Doin' some work on
the sewer main in a couple days,

just wanted to warn ya.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Chains rattling

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--
Stammering

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

It's good for us to grow...

as people.

Toilet flushing

Shower's free.
Who's next?

Growls

Hey!

She's not even related to us.

Go pee downstairs.
Go.

Urinating

How long do you plan
on keeping Molly around?

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

Sniffs

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

Sniffs

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Chuckles
Here you go. Good doggy.

Exhales

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Knock at door Incoming.

Rock music

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.
Sniffs

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

Brendan Benson's
The Light Of Day



 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day



You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Indistinct distant chatter

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

Pounding upstairs

Chuckles You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

Knock at door

Panting

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

Laughs

Baby crying

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

Sighs
I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

Baby crying

Door opens

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Sighs
Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Sighs

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

Door opens

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Jackhammering

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Electric buzzing

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

Clank We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

Rock music



You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!
Coughs

Aah!



Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?
Laughs

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.



Ah, good work.

Knock at door

Baby crying

Get your act together, lady.

Sighs

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

Sighs

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Door shuts

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Clatter upstairs Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

Drill whirring

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Drilling

Sighs Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

Crying I've never had
so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

Take Me Out To The Coast
by Waters



 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

Sighs

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.



 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Laughs

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Gunshots

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.
Gunshot

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Gunshots

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.
Gunshot

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

Gunshots

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Ice cream truck chimes

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Toilet flushes

Exhales

Really, ladies?

Really funny.
Knocking

Phone line trilling

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

Rock music

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings



Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.



It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

All murmuring
What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

Sparse chuckles

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Laughter

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

Cooing

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Broom sweeping

Grunts

Aah. Jesus.
Grunts

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Door opens

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Crying

Knock at door Debbie?

Sobs It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.
Crying

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Crying

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Deep breath

Crying

Come on.

Sobs

We gotta dig.

Rock music _



Gasps _

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?



You have been blogging
about me every day?

Grunts

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Explosion Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

Car alarm blaring

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Chuckles Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

Chuckles

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Not much in there.

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Lighter clicks

Don't worry about your dweeb.

He's just off
licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Dialing

Phone line trilling

Voicemail beeps

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Sighs

Sighs

Chuckles

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

Sighs

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Giggles

Both moaning

Fuck.

Metal clanking

I'm a dick!

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

Can you come down?

Dog barks

Hey.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

Rock music



Fireworks squealing

Hey. Whoa.
Guys, guys.

No fucking guns, all right?

It's just a drunk

She's at the pool.

We gotta keep digging.

Yes, I fucking know I got shot.

Remember,
do not sit on cushions,

carpets, anything foam,

Say their names slowly

If you feel something

the body part lightly.

Okay?
Let's do this.

Tires screeching

- Come on.
- Holy shit.

- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

Groans

Fuck.

Tires screeching

I'm just gonna
take another minute.

Take your time.

I can explain this.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturges
from Child Protective Services.

She just walked in.

Yes!

Oh, my God.

I totally almost drowned
a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

until she passed out!

Oh, my God.
Guess what.

You do not "F"
with Debbie Gallagher!

Chuckles Don't "F" with me.

Debs.

Yeah. What?

Chuckles

Baby crying





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

Gasps How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Beep Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Grunts Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.

 you're so sure of?

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Chains rattling

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--
Stammering

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

as people.

How long do you plan

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

Sniffs

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

Sniffs

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Chuckles
Here you go. Good doggy.

Exhales

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Knock at door Incoming.

Rock music

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.
Sniffs

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

Brendan Benson's
The Light Of Day



 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day



You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Indistinct distant chatter

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

Pounding upstairs

Chuckles You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

Knock at door

Panting

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

Laughs

Baby crying

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

Sighs
I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

Baby crying

Door opens

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Sighs
Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Sighs

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

Door opens

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Jackhammering

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Jackhammering

Electric buzzing

Sparks

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

Clank We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

Rock music



You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!
Coughs

Aah!



Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?
Laughs

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.



Ah, good work.

Knock at door

Baby crying

Get your act together, lady.

Sighs

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

where Ginger was,
it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

Sighs

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Door shuts

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Clatter upstairs Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

Drill whirring

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Drilling

Sighs Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

Crying I've never had
so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

Take Me Out To The Coast
by Waters



 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

Sighs

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.



 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Laughs

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Gunshots

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.
Gunshot

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Gunshots

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.
Gunshot

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

Gunshots

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Ice cream truck chimes

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Toilet flushes

Exhales

Really, ladies?

Really funny.
Knocking

Phone line trilling

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

Rock music

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings



Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.



It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

All murmuring
What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

Sparse chuckles

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Laughter

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

Cooing

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Broom sweeping

Grunts

Aah. Jesus.
Grunts

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Door opens

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Crying

Knock at door Debbie?

Sobs It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.
Crying

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Crying

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Deep breath

Crying

Come on.

Sobs

We gotta dig.

Rock music _



Gasps _

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?



You have been blogging
about me every day?

Grunts

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Explosion Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

Car alarm blaring

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Chuckles Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

Chuckles

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Slapping

Groans

Not much in there.

We could've used an eyedropper.

Jeez, Kevin.

Exhales Okay.

Deebreaths

Bottoms up.

Ooh.

Warmer than I expected.

Ooh. Laughs

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Lighter clicks

Don't worry about your dweeb.

He's just off
licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Dialing

Phone line trilling

Voicemail beeps

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Sighs

Sighs

Chuckles

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

Sighs

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Giggles

Both moaning

Fuck.

Metal clanking

I'm a dick!

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

Can you come down?

Dog barks

Hey.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

Rock music



Fireworks squealing

Hey. Whoa.
Guys, guys.

No fucking guns, all right?

It's just a drunk
old lady in there.

Come on.
Come on.

Fuck.

Coughs

Where's Debbie?

She's at the pool.

We gotta keep digging.

Cooing

Grunts

Oh, come on.

Clock chimes

Oh, fuck.

- Jesus Christ.
- Hey!

Fuckers!

Oh, fuck.

- Aah!
- Fuck.

- Go!
- Fuckers!

Gunshot

- Fuck!
- Fuck!

Fucking--
Gunshot

No fucking way!

Fuck!
Fucking Ned!

Are you fucking him too?

Aah!
Fucking drive.

You got shot, Mickey!

Yes, I fucking know I got shot.

Tires screeching

Gunshot

Grunts



Remember,
do not sit on cushions,

carpets, anything foam,
or porous.

Say their names slowly
and calmly.

If you feel something
crawling on you

don't scream, just shake
the body part lightly.

Okay?
Let's do this.

Tires screeching

- Come on.
- Holy shit.

- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

Groans

Fuck.

Tires screeching

I'm just gonna
take another minute.

Take your time.

- You kidding me?
- Stay there.

- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus.

Just one fucking old lady, huh?

Aah! Ow! Ow.

Children crying

Well, if it isn't
the toughest badass

fag beater this side
of the Chicago River.

Fuck off.

Grunts



I'll show you some tits.

Deep breath



Chuckles

Screams, grunts



Knock at door

Fiona's fits better,
doesn't it?

Sure.



Children crying

Screaming

Oh, my.

You're almost done, Mickey.

Aah!

Grunts

Ha!

Giggles

Squeals

Screaming, groaning

Ian, what the fuck?

I can explain this.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturges
from Child Protective Services.

She just walked in.

Yes!

Oh, my God.

I totally almost drowned
a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

until she passed out!

Oh, my God.
Guess what.

You do not "F"
with Debbie Gallagher!

Chuckles Don't "F" with me.

Debs.

Yeah. What?

Chuckles

Baby crying





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

Gasps How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Beep Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Grunts Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.




High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing

El Camino's Lawd Have Mercy

Chuckles

Fuck you, Gallagher.

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

Ahh.

Sighs

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

Knock at door

I--
Exhales

Doin' some work on
the sewer main in a couple days,

just wanted to warn ya.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Chains rattling

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--
Stammering

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

It's good for us to grow...

as people.

Toilet flushing

Shower's free.
Who's next?

Growls

Hey!

She's not even related to us.

Go pee downstairs.
Go.

Urinating

How long do you plan
on keeping Molly around?

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

Sniffs

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

Sniffs

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Chuckles
Here you go. Good doggy.

Exhales

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Knock at door Incoming.

Rock music

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.
Sniffs

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

Brendan Benson's
The Light Of Day



 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day



You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Indistinct distant chatter

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

Pounding upstairs

Chuckles You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

Knock at door

Panting

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

Laughs

Baby crying

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

Sighs
I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

Baby crying

Door opens

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Sighs
Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Sighs

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

Door opens

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Jackhammering

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Jackhammering

Electric buzzing

Sparks

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

Clank We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

Rock music



You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!
Coughs

Aah!



Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?
Laughs

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.



Ah, good work.

Knock at door

Baby crying

Get your act together, lady.

Sighs

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

where Ginger was,
it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

Sighs

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Door shuts

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Clatter upstairs Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

Drill whirring

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Drilling

Sighs Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

Crying I've never had
so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

Take Me Out To The Coast
by Waters



 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

Sighs

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.



 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Laughs

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Gunshots

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.
Gunshot

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Gunshots

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.
Gunshot

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

Gunshots

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Ice cream truck chimes

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Toilet flushes

Exhales

Really, ladies?

Really funny.
Knocking

Phone line trilling

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

Rock music

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings



Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.



It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

All murmuring
What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

Sparse chuckles

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Laughter

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

Cooing

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Broom sweeping

Grunts

Aah. Jesus.
Grunts

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Door opens

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Crying

Knock at door Debbie?

Sobs It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.
Crying

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Crying

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Deep breath

Crying

Come on.

Sobs

We gotta dig.

Rock music _



Gasps _

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?



You have been blogging
about me every day?

Grunts

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Explosion Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

Car alarm blaring

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Chuckles Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

Chuckles

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Slapping

Groans

Not much in there.

We could've used an eyedropper.

Jeez, Kevin.

Exhales Okay.

Deebreaths

Bottoms up.

Ooh.

Warmer than I expected.

Ooh. Laughs

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Lighter clicks

Don't worry about your dweeb.

He's just off
licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Dialing

Phone line trilling

Voicemail beeps

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Sighs

Sighs

Chuckles

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

Sighs

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Giggles

Both moaning

Fuck.

Metal clanking

I'm a dick!

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

Can you come down?

Dog barks

Hey.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

Rock music



Fireworks squealing

Hey. Whoa.
Guys, guys.

No fucking guns, all right?

It's just a drunk
old lady in there.

Come on.
Come on.

Fuck.

Coughs

Where's Debbie?

She's at the pool.

We gotta keep digging.

Cooing

Rock music



Clock chiming



Grunts

Oh, come on.

Clock chimes

Oh, fuck.

- Jesus Christ.
- Hey!

Fuckers!

Oh, fuck.

- Aah!
- Fuck.

- Go!
- Fuckers!

Gunshot

- Fuck!
- Fuck!

Fucking--
Gunshot

No fucking way!

Fuck!
Fucking Ned!

Are you fucking him too?

Aah!
Fucking drive.

You got shot, Mickey!

Yes, I fucking know I got shot.

Tires screeching

Gunshot

Grunts



Remember,
do not sit on cushions,

carpets, anything foam,
or porous.

Say their names slowly
and calmly.

If you feel something
crawling on you

don't scream, just shake
the body part lightly.

Okay?
Let's do this.

Tires screeching

- Come on.
- Holy shit.

- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

Groans

Fuck.

Tires screeching

I'm just gonna
take another minute.

Take your time.

- You kidding me?
- Stay there.

- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus.

Just one fucking old lady, huh?

Aah! Ow! Ow.

Children crying

Well, if it isn't
the toughest badass

fag beater this side
of the Chicago River.

Fuck off.

Grunts



I'll show you some tits.

Deep breath



Chuckles

Screams, grunts



Knock at door

Fiona's fits better,
doesn't it?

Sure.



Children crying

Screaming

Oh, my.

You're almost done, Mickey.

Aah!

Grunts

Ha!

Giggles

Squeals

Screaming, groaning

Ian, what the fuck?

I can explain this.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturges
from Child Protective Services.

She just walked in.

Yes!

Oh, my God.

I totally almost drowned
a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

until she passed out!

Oh, my God.
Guess what.

You do not "F"
with Debbie Gallagher!

Chuckles Don't "F" with me.

Debs.

Yeah. What?

Chuckles

Baby crying





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.




 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Fuck you, Gallagher.

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

Ahh.

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

I--

Doin' some work on
the sewer main in a couple days,

just wanted to warn ya.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

It's good for us to grow...

as people.

Shower's free.
Who's next?

Hey!

She's not even related to us.

Go pee downstairs.
Go.

How long do you plan
on keeping Molly around?

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Here you go. Good doggy.

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Incoming.

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day

You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!

Aah!

Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.

Ah, good work.

Get your act together, lady.

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

where Ginger was,
it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

I've never had so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.

 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Really, ladies?

Really funny.

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings

Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.

It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Aah. Jesus.

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Debbie?

It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Come on.

We gotta dig.

_

_

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?

You have been blogging
about me every day?

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Not much in there.

We could've used an eyedropper.

Jeez, Kevin.

Okay.

Bottoms up.

Ooh.

Warmer than I expected.

Ooh.

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Don't worry about your dweeb.

He's just off
licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Fuck.

I'm a dick!

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

Can you come down?

Hey.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

Hey. Whoa.
Guys, guys.

No fucking guns, all right?

It's just a drunk
old lady in there.

Come on.
Come on.

Fuck.

Where's Debbie?

She's at the pool.

We gotta keep digging.

Oh, come on.

Oh, fuck.

- Jesus Christ.
- Hey!

Fuckers!

Oh, fuck.

- Aah!
- Fuck.

- Go!
- Fuckers!

- Fuck!
- Fuck!

Fucking--

No fucking way!

Fuck!
Fucking Ned!

Are you fucking him too?

Aah!
Fucking drive.

You got shot, Mickey!

Yes, I fucking know I got shot.

Remember,
do not sit on cushions,

carpets, anything foam,
or porous.

Say their names slowly
and calmly.

If you feel something
crawling on you

don't scream, just shake
the body part lightly.

Okay?
Let's do this.

- Come on.
- Holy shit.

- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

Fuck.

I'm just gonna
take another minute.

Take your time.

- You kidding me?
- Stay there.

- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus.

Just one fucking old lady, huh?

Aah! Ow! Ow.

Well, if it isn't
the toughest badass

fag beater this side
of the Chicago River.

Fuck off.

I'll show you some tits.

Fiona's fits better,
doesn't it?

Sure.

Oh, my.

You're almost done, Mickey.

Aah!

Ha!

Ian, what the fuck?

I can explain this.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturges
from Child Protective Services.

She just walked in.

Yes!

Oh, my God.

I totally almost drowned
a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

until she passed out!

Oh, my God.
Guess what.

You do not "F"
with Debbie Gallagher!

Don't "F" with me.

Debs.

Yeah. What?





For those of you who were
too lazy to tune in last week,

this is what you missed
on Shameless...

Thanks, Tim.

Stay down.

Gasps How long was that?

Not long enough.

City pools are filled
with city kids.

You need at least 90 seconds.

Cancer's opening up
a whole wonderful world for you.

I was able to pull some strings

and get you
these special cancer pills.

- Will they cure my cancer?
- Depends on your attitude.

I just got
my one-year chip

from Sex Addicts Anonymous.

- I'll go slow.
- Not gonna happen.

Jody only wants to cuddle
and do it like missionaries.

It's boring.

If I kick it up a notch,
there's no stopping me.

It's an addiction.

I think everyone at work,
other than me,

is blowing the manager.

Princess, I got it.
Go take your break.

It's a not a break, break.

It's a "Bobby" break.

They're all gonna realize
I'm not carrying

my share of the load,
literally.

Gotta save your sperm
for baby-making.

This was
a baby-making session?

Hoping so.

Beep Daddy, it's Molly.

Mommy died.
Please come.

Who the fuck's Molly?

She's my half-sister.

That's just my girl penis.

Looks exactly like a boy penis.

Am I coming home with you?

You don't need
to be playing house

with Mandy Milkovich.

Doing shit like this
signals something

to a girl like Mandy.

Sure you know what kind
of signals you're sending?

Hey, Fiona, Ian,
you met my father.

Grunts Who the fuck are you?

It's Jimmy's dad.

Were you trying to screw Lip?

Ian.

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Six kids living in squalor.

No parental supervision.

They're all criminals.

That is an all-time low.




High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

El Camino's Lawd Have Mercy

Can rattling

Chuckles

Fuck you, Gallagher.

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy

 Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy

Ahh.

Sighs

Dude, little man in the canoe.

I'm sorry, but my game is off.

How does a tongue
forget how to lick?

It's the whole

"my dad is gay
for your brother" thing.

It's like on a film loop
in my brain.

Ian's cock,
my dad's mouth--

in, out, in, out.

It's just sex.
He's still the same person.

But is he?

Because I'm rethinking
everything

I even thought about him.

Like in high school
when my friends came over,

was he checking out
their asses?

Or that guy,
Uncle Rick--

his racquetball partner
with the feathered hair?

- Uh-huh.
- Do not leave.

Too hot in here anyway.

Sheets are sticking to my back.

And I gotta go to work.

Be happy you have a real dad,

not some thieving
alcoholic deadbeat

who's puking
into the silverware drawer.

Knock at door

I--
Exhales

Doin' some work on
the sewer main in a couple days,

just wanted to warn ya.

Warn us what?

The water's gonna
be shut off for the day.

Oh, thanks.

Chains rattling

Honey?
What is that for?

Sex swing.

Trying to see if it can bear
both of us at once.

If not, I can get us
a four-post freestander.

Oh, God.

What--
is this--

- aren't we--?
- It's fine.

It's just with all the, um,

shipments and everything.

And just--
it's totally fine.

It's just--
Stammering

I'm just not used to being,
um, submissive.

You can be the dom tomorrow.

Okay. Oh, that's fine.

It's good for us to grow...

as people.

Toilet flushing

Shower's free.
Who's next?

Growls

Hey!

She's not even related to us.

Go pee downstairs.
Go.

Urinating

How long do you plan
on keeping Molly around?

Till we find someone
to take him in.

- Are you looking?
- Yeah.

Good. Might as well
tell him he's a he,

while you're at it.

Mm, what--
what time is it?

- Sex o'clock.
- Hey!

Quick, before Carl gets back.

- Yeah, no, I can't--
- I'm sleeping.

I got to, uh-- I gotta
help Carl set up for day care.

I thought
that was Debbie's job.

Yeah, no, it is.

She's just going
to the pool today,

so I promised I'd supervise.

Still sleeping.

Sniffs

What are your plans
for the day?

Actually me and Kev are taking

the ice cream truck to Indiana,

going on a fireworks run.

Can we come?

Uh, no, we won't all fit
on the way back.

You know, stash is probably
gonna take up,

like, half the truck, so--

Can you do it tomorrow?

I really want us
to take Molly to the beach

before the weekend
meatheads descend.

Jesus.

Other people exist, maybe?

Sniffs

No, I gotta get down there

before the Roman candles
sell out.

Hey, did you find any, uh,
Molly relatives?

Tracked down a second cousin
in the Navy on Facebook.

Did you post on his wall?

Status says he's on sea duty.

I'll do it when he gets back.

I mean, um, when's that?

Didn't say.

Okay.

Look, cage the ferret, okay?

Day care parents
don't appreciate morning muff.

Chuckles
Here you go. Good doggy.

Exhales

100.
100 seconds!

Jimmy, I can't do breakfast,
set up for day care,

and practice holding my breath
all at the same time.

Oh, it's still broken.

It's a finger, not your neck.

Carl, can you set up
for day care?

I need to get to the pool
at exactly 9:00 AM.

- It's opening day.
- I'm feeding Liam.

I can help.

Thanks, Molly.

Okay, wipe down the exersaucers
and teething toys,

then check the nap-pads
for head-lice and boogers.

That's a really pretty dress.

It hides my girl penis.

Mom said it's impolite
to show off my bulge.

More coffee?

Lip, Ian, come down here a sec!

Okay, listen up, Gallaghers
and Milkoviches.

They're digging up
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off,

so we need to do laundry
and dishes beforehand.

What about toilets?

I guess we just
won't flush that day.

Well, we could fill up buckets.

Gross.

He crippled or something?

So helpful.

Must be nice having a spouse.

Wait, they're digging up
the lawn?

Yeah.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Knock at door Incoming.

Rock music

Okay.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

Hey, there, fella.
Sniffs

Ooh.

Let's go take the Browns
to the Super Bowl, huh?

Jesus!

Guess who came by today.
The city.

They're digging up the yard
to work on the sewer line.

You need to find Aunt Ginger
before they do.

Who?

The dead relative
whose social security checks

you've been cashing.

You buried her, you unbury her.

- Hand.
- Come on, Debs.

Bye, Frank.

Brendan Benson's
The Light Of Day



 I don't care

 if I ever see
the light of day



You're not trying
to look at my dick, are you?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm not even
thinking about your dick...

in my dad's mouth.

- I'm not.
- Good, then don't.

Yep. Not.

Ian's dick
was in your dad's mouth?

It's a figure of speech.

It's like saying,
"none of your business.

Your dick's
in my dad's mouth, man."

Who says that?

Gay dudes.

- Is Ian gay?
- No, no.

It was euphemistic.

Is that what gay people
like to do?

Jesus. Forget it.
I'm-- okay.

Oh, uh, Jamie.

You any good with power tools?

Hey, Lip, I need your help.

Oh, busy.

Too busy to help your old man?

Yes, forever.

Hey, Ian?

He's getting ready for work.

Nice paint job.

You got your shoes on?

Yeah. Why?

We're going over to Sheila's.

Gonna grab some of dead Eddie's
heavy-duty machines.

That fella
loved lawn equipment.

But I'm sick.

You don't look sick to me.

Cancer?

Oh, the clinic called.

The pills worked.

No more cancer.
Congrats.

- I'm not dying?
- No!

- Can we have a party?
- You bet.

Just as soon as we dig up
this old, dead crack whore.

Come on, let's go.

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 so hot now

Indistinct distant chatter

Are you a lesbo?

Um, no.

Although I know many people

who have had relations
with same sex individuals.

I believe all people
should have the right

to love whomever they choose.

And even though civil unions

are legal in Illinois,
it isn't enough.

Change is possible.
It starts with us and--

Stop staring at us, freak bag.

And grow some tits.

 So hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

 it's so hot now

 it's so hot now

 I feel your love
in the atmosphere

Pounding upstairs

Chuckles You hear that?

They're going for
the brass ring up there.

I did that,
showed them the way--

like a headlamp in a coal mine.

You see, Frank Gallagher
knows people.

I-I just intuit.

I was, uh-- I was
a psychology major

for a semester.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

What's this?

Uh, that's a pacifier
for your anus.

Knock at door

Panting

They're early, Frank!

Hello.

Can you be on baby duty?

Looks like a priest
with a 'Nam vet.

Hello?

It's Father Pete.

He's with a hospice patient,
a nun.

They're out of room
at St. Steven's.

Laughs

Baby crying

- Here.
- Oh, Hymie.

Hey.

Hey, nice to see you again,
Father Pete.

And you too, Jody.

Hi, I'm Jody.

Sighs
I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been
a little preoccupied.

Not at all.

Careful, careful.

She's not long for this world,
I'm afraid.

- Oh.
- She's taken a vow of silence,

so you don't have to worry
about her

keeping you up all night
with her praying.

Oh.

This is her pain medication.

- Great, yeah.
- And-- and--

oh, and make sure
her iPad is always charged.

She can play Angry Birds
till the cows come home.

Oh, well--

that's just a, um,
harness for patients.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh, shed key?

On the fridge,
top of the fridge.

Why are you orange?

Frank?

Baby crying

Door opens

I don't know what it is, red,

but, uh, I feel less alone
in the world

knowing I can drive across town

and find you here,
bent over cans of chicken stock.

Sighs
Look. I-I'm sorry.

Truly. I just--

Sighs

Can you forgive a man
who's falling apart?

A little?

Yeah.

Door opens

- Can I kiss you?
- No.

Just a little.

So listen.

Um, I need somebody
to rob my house,

and I'm hoping you could help.

You want me to rob your house?

Candace changed the locks
on the house--

my goddamn house.

And she won't let me back in,

so I need someone
to steal my stuff.

If I do it, the neighbors
might recognize me.

You go in during daylight hours

and you look like movers.

You'll be fine.

Look, she stays up
till 3:00 AM

drinking Stoli vanilla
and watching bowflex ads.

She'll be unconscious
until well past noon.

Okay, this could be
very lucrative for you.

You can take anything you want.

Come on, it's all insured.

All I want
are my two Armani suits,

my Lucien Freud, and my bottle

of 1990 Chateau Latour
Pauillac.

What do you say?

Will you do it?

- Frank?
- Yes, son?

Why would a dude put his penis

in another dude's mouth?

Well, sometimes men discover
things about themselves

like they prefer male genitalia

to female genitalia.

Wait.

So some guys
like to lick wieners?

Well, I'm sure
at first they're attracted

to each other's build.

And once a connection
gets made,

then the wieners get licked.

It's a scorcher today,
ain't it?

Hey, Debs, how was the pool?

Great.
Where are the swim diapers?

Thanks. Uh, aisle nine.

Aah!

Did you put tacks in my drawer?

My baby sister
shoulda got your job.

It took my four months
to teach her

how to swallow without gagging,
and for what?

Yeah, it's not her fault
she got a lazy eye.

She was raised right.

She don't think
she's better than nobody.

I'm sorry about your sister,

but I got five kids to feed.

Fiona?

Oh, you know,
just employee shenanigans.

You got coupons for this?

I've got an 11:00
ovarian cyst, an 11:30 UTI,

and a preteen
pregnancy in the lobby.

So can you tell me
why you're here

when I just saw you
two weeks ago?

We've been bangin' like bunnies

and I can't get pregnant.
I need another exam.

It won't change anything.

But you said last time
I had a chance

of getting pregnant.

I believe I said
you had very little chance.

I also used the words,
"highly unlikely"

and "wildly improbable."

You got my baby girl's
hopes up for nothing.

I chose to mitigate
a difficult discussion

with upbeat
and positive phrasings.

I need to know the truth.

Can I have a damn baby or not?

Put is this way,
you have a 99.999 chance

of not getting pregnant,
nothing is impossible.

So does, like, one penis
go into the other penis?

Of course.
When gay dudes get horny,

their pee holes open.

Jackhammering

Hey.

- Swim diapers.
- Thank God.

I've already had
to fish out two poops.

Ew.

Jackhammering

Electric buzzing

Sparks

Daddy!

Hey. Whoa.

You stink like bleach.

Yeah, I was at the pool today.

I stayed under for 112 seconds.

- Hey, good for you!
- Yeah.

Show those syphilis-ridden
turbo sluts a thing or two.

They think they own the water

just 'cause they piss in it.

Clank We hit something.

What's that smell?

- Ew.
- Whew.

- The sewer line?
- Oh, man.

You probably should
patch that up

with some duct tape
and a t-shirt.

Aah, God. Bleh.

Rock music



You sure we're digging
in the right spot?

Ew!
Coughs

Aah!



Man, I can't believe your wife

actually came to your house.

I thought V was gonna
rip her throat out.

Yo, so what's up
with you and Mandy?

You guys seem tight.

I guess.

She's gotten hella clingy.

You rescued
her cross-dressing sibling.

You swashbuckled
that shit, man.

Seals the deal for a chick,
I'm serious.

Girls take that hero crap
straight to the bank.

She cook for you now?

- Fold your clothes?
- Sometimes.

She stay over
more than four nights a week?

Help you out with random stuff?

Huh?
Laughs

Dude, you are ghetto married.

Enjoy it.
You get all the perks,

no paperwork.

Guys would kill for that setup.

I kinda hate it.

What's wrong with you, man?

I think Karen
messed you up bad.

Gun it.



Ah, good work.

Knock at door

Baby crying

Get your act together, lady.

Sighs

I got day-old chuck,
two-day-old sirloin,

couple of
partially soft bagels,

and, like, two gallons
of nearly expired mayo.

Oh, and a sheet cake.

Joanie was late
picking up her kid again.

And guess what the excuse was.

- Flat tire?
- Flat tire.

It's not the homo thing
that gets me,

'cause gays hit on me
all the time

and it doesn't bother me.

Of course they do.

You wear designer jeans

and coconut hair product.

You're like gay flypaper.

"Haddy birthday Juby?"

Bakery guy is dyslexic.

- Where's Frank?
- Haven't seen him.

Well, he's gotta
fill in that hole

where Ginger was,
it reeks out there.

He forgot where he buried her.

You're kidding.

We couldn't find her.

And Carl busted the sewer line.

Wait.
You picking up guitar?

Bitches at work giving me shit.

Thumb tacks
in my change drawer.

You believe that?

Holy shit.

Yep. Yeah, we did good.

- Boomtown was good to us.
- Yeah.

Blowing up
the Hancock building?

No, we don't have
any more room in the truck.

- Can we store some here?
- Are you nuts?

Look at that kid's face.

I promise I'll put it
in a no-Carl zone.

As if that exists.

- Don't touch it.
- Go wash your face, pyro.

Mandy, make yourself useful.
Set the table.

You want pop, beer,
or ice water?

Uh, water's good.
Thanks.

Put these on Lip's bed.

- She's out in a week, okay?
- Which one?

Sighs

What's with Jimmy?

That shit with his dad?

He's pretty broken up about it.

No one's dead, wounded,
or incarcerated.

What do you expect?
Rich kid from the North Side--

It's his first
big family crisis.

He's taking it pretty hard.

Left side of your mouth.

- Other left.
- Dude's got daddy issues.

- No wonder you dig him.
- I can hear you.

Hey, Lip, go reorganize
the truck.

Put the weed in the fridge,
poppers in the freezer.

Put the smokes on top
and the bangers

- underneath the seats.
- Yep.

I'll help.

Cake for dinner?

I gotta get to the Alibi.

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

Never had a chance to go.

Okay. I love you.
Mwah.

Door shuts

Hey.

What about a surrogate?

- You offering?
- Hell no.

Bet you could find someone good
on Craigslist.

Bitch gets paid,
IVF docs gets paid,

medical bills,
maternity clothes,

lawyer fee, contract fees.

Low end? 40 grand.

Need a truckload
of slave-play

to raise that kinda scratch.

What'll you do?

Something.

Sister, I so admire
the vow you've taken.

It takes such strength

to resist the lure
of temptation,

verbally or otherwise.

Clatter upstairs Oh!

Oh, sister, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Jody and I are just
experimenting

with new liberties.

Drill whirring

As you know, our bodies
are God's temple,

and it's as if we're adding on
a little wing or two.

So there's no way in the world

you would ever talk?

Drilling

Sighs Oh, sister.

Jody is pushing me
to new levels.

It's completely my fault.

He warned me not to go

through this gateway with him,

but I wouldn't listen.

And now I can't
find my way back.

Crying I've never had
so many things

inserted into so many
parts of my body at once!

Have I encouraged him
to overstep his boundaries?

Or am I helping him to create

new and--
and healthy ones?

Because I admit,

inflicting sexual pain

gives me great pleasure.

You ready, mama?
Batteries are charged!

Oh, sister,
I feel so much better.

Thank you for letting me
get that off my chest.

Oh, you're a good one.

Gloves?

Got some cuts
on my hands at work.

- I think it's dry.
- Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God.

I just realized.

That huge fight
that dad had with Mr. Ward,

my gay seventh grade
science teacher--

I thought it was because
of the crappy grade

I got on my bread mold project,

but they kept on
excusing themselves

to discuss it in private.

I am such an idiot.

And that wedding
that we went to in Hawaii

when I was in high school--
me, mom, and Chip

went to bed early
and dad stayed up dancing

all night with the best man.

I guess what really gets me

is that he couldn't
tell me the truth.

I mean, did he think
I wouldn't accept him

or that I'd think less of him?

Why didn't he trust me?

Am I the only one
who didn't know?

Does my brother know?

Oh, I bet you my brother knows.

Take Me Out To The Coast
by Waters



 And I was wrong

 to believe in myself

 I can't belong to a scene

 and no one else

Wait, so there's
butthole involved?

Sometimes, not always.

Hey. Ian and I are gonna
go get high

and watch Family Guy.
You wanna come?

Uh, no, I've been
driving all day.

I'm exhausted.

Doing a night load.

Any takers?

Here you go.

Lip, nothing?

Did ours this afternoon.

Maybe next time
you wanna throw in

Debbie or Carl or Liam's
with yours.

Sure, no problem.

Hey, if you change your mind,

come down, okay?

Mwah.

I need to know
where the gay wieners go.

Sighs

You know how you plunge
a toilet when it's backed up?

Yeah.

Think of it as one dude

plunging another dude's toilet.



 Take us out to the coast

 and we'll find our way, oh

Could always adopt.

I don't want
someone else's kid.

I want a little punk
with your pretty eyes

and your crooked smile.

I don't know, V, at some point

we might have to accept
that it's not meant to be.

Not meant to be?

Was I meant to get an STD at 17

from some lame-ass rapper

that would trash my tubes?

Was I meant to Google him
all afternoon

to find out he has eight kids?

Was I meant to friend him
on Facebook

to write on his wall
some psychotic rant

about how he ruined my life?

- Baby, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

Fuck his weak-ass rhymes,

fuck that
tree frog-lookin' doctor,

and fuck all the fuckin' money
I spent on condoms

for the last 20 years.

And fuck you for acting like
you don't wanna

- fight harder for this.
- Whoa.

You know I do,
more than anything.

Then let's fight.

Laughs

Enough with the kicking!

- Christ!
- Where is she?

I can't--
I give up.

I need sleep.

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones.

The police show up.

They figure out
it's Aunt Ginger.

They date the bones.

They realize she's been dead
for 14 years.

And yet,
her social security checks

are being cashed every month.

This isn't a DUI, Frank.

You buried a body and you stole

from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

Think about it.

Fuck.

Gunshots

Hey.
You know the guy

you beat the shit out of
at that club?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion,

take all of his crap.

Really?

Hilarious.
Gunshot

He can't get it himself.
Divorce.

Says I can take
whatever I want.

He's loaded.
You want in?

Gunshots

Jesus!
Use blanks, maybe?

Fuck.

Can I bring my cousins?

- Yeah.
- All right.

I'm in.
Gunshot

I don't know what you see

in that geriatric viagroid.

He buys me stuff,
orders me room service.

Gunshots

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

Ice cream truck chimes

Yeah, we're low on joints.

I got extra weed in the fridge,

but it needs rolling.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

- Yeah, that'd be great.
- No, we're good, thanks.

Can you roll us some spliffs?

Sure.
We need papers.

Right there.

You guys are really killing it.

Whoa, you are a giant.

Ask me if I play basketball
and I'll punch your nuts.

What do you want?

Two fountains,
a pack of sparklers,

three joints, and a bomb pop.

Hey, you got any
community service hours left?

- Why?
- Molly could help, he offered.

No. You know what?
I'm covered.

Actually we're good here too.
You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I gotta hit the Alibi
in ten minutes away.

- I can handle it.
- I'm good to stay.

No, please just
go home, Mandy--

to your own fucking house,
for once.

That was harsh.

Toilet flushes

Exhales

Really, ladies?

Really funny.
Knocking

Phone line trilling

Hi, this is Fiona.

I'm working register two.

I'm locked in the bathroom.

I did try the knob.

Fine. I'll try again.

On what planet
is it cool for you

to take a smoke break
in the employee bathroom?

I don't even smoke Parliaments.

Rock music

 I remember

 how I played
the fool for you

 now I'm just a fool

 until you do this every time

 that I wake

 is a number that sings



Holy crap,
congrats on your puberty.

Yeah, your tits look great.

Thanks.

You know, they always say
it happens overnight.

Go for a swim.

Try out your new bod.

Okay.



It's my fourth.

I don't care if it's your 44th.

We don't do buybacks.

- I'm broke.
- Hey, news flash, princess.

So is 150%
of the patronage here.

Oh, there she is.
Welcome back.

How was your vacay?

Oh, I went surfing,
got hit by a jet ski,

- saw a dolphin masturbate.
- Yeah?

Well, my finger's broken,
my parents are divorced,

- and my dad's a fairy, so--
- A fairy?

Hello, 1983.

Did you get my CO2 tanks?

Yeah. Hey, can you
make it quick?

I gotta get out of here.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

Hey.

You know, not for nothin',
but, uh,

no one likes to hear
a grown man whine.

It's like the verbal equivalent
of a dude wearing uggs.

Yeah, well, I appreciate
the sympathy, thanks.

Get over it.

Fiona doesn't have room for it.

She's busting her ass
just to keep food on the table.

Good denizens of Cook County,

I have a proposition.

All murmuring
What the fuck is it now, Frank?!

Do you remember--

do you remember the holdup

of that jewelry store
on South Ashland in '92?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Bastards cleaned out
these poor spics

of every piece of crap
that they had.

That was my mother.

She did the heist.

And I think she buried the crap
in my backyard.

How do you know that?

Well, she stashed it somewhere

and then she forgot where.

So the other day
I was planting some basil.

I've recently gotten
back into gardening.

And I found this.

Shit, is that gold?

Could be.

Pretty dirty,
gotta get it appraised.

The point being,
this is only the tip

of the golden iceberg.

Now I can't dig it
all up by myself.

So I will give a sizeable cut

to anyone who helps me
unearth it.

So who's with me?

Sparse chuckles

- Fuck it. Why not?
- I'm in.

There you go.
Bravo, soldiers.

Onward, onward.
Let's go.

- Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.

This is what
made America great.

Ew, period! Period!

Laughter

Hey. What'd I miss
at the pool?

Cooing

- Should we--
- Let's just make sure

we explored all other options.

Okay.

What about that maid
you used to work with?

Chantrelle?
Too crazy.

How about Macie
down at the old folks home?

- Too medicated.
- Fiona?

Too white.

Really?
Is that a concern of yours?

I want it to have
my genetic material,

or at least look like it does.

What about
your cousin Sharonda?

I called her this morning.

She fell off the wagon,
was fried by noon.

Well, what about
your other cousin?

You know, the, uh, pretty one?

Oh, the pretty one?

No, 'cause I want our kid
to look pretty like you.

- I mean--
- She's 13.

Wow.

She seems older.

Broom sweeping

Grunts

Aah. Jesus.
Grunts

Mother of Christ, it stinks.

There's so much shit
in the yard.

Shut up and keep digging.

The one arm wonder's
making more progress than you.

This is as far as you got?

Don't judge!

Frank, do you know for certain

there's jewelry
buried out here?

Uh, you know what?

Try along that fence there.

I saw her rootin' around
in there like a badger.

Wowee.

Is it desert storm night
at the cheesecake factory?

Why are you
acting like a dick to Mandy?

I think that qualifies as

none of your fuckin' business.

Well, she called me
from aunt's house,

said you told her to go home.

Is Molly leaving too?

What? No, Debs.
Look, man.

She is always on me
about, you know,

our plans for the night
and when

we're going to see
her friend's band

and what we're doing next week.

So she likes
hanging out with you.

- That's not a crime.
- I like Molly.

She's not my wife.

No, she's a good person
who does nice things for you.

What are you,
her fuckin' lawyer?

No, I'm her best friend.

All right, and you're acting
like a douche bag.

You want out? End it.
You don't?

Stop treating her like garbage.

But just 'cause Karen
wiped her ass with you

doesn't give you the right
to shit on Mandy.

Door opens

Guys, bad news.
We all gotta dig tonight.

The city's coming and
Frank can't find aunt ginger.

So?

So someone's going to jail
if we don't find her.

Yeah, Frank, you mean.

There's a body.
We know about it.

We're accomplices.

Once again saddled
with a mess we didn't create.

Sooner we get out there
and dig,

the sooner it'll all be over.

I still got blisters
on my hand from yesterday.

I can dig.

I have pretty developed
upper arms for a chick.

I need to borrow
your turkey baster.

I don't want Molly to leave!

What's with her?

She got her period
at the pool today.

I can't wait to get my period.

Mom said it's the body's
tribute to female sacrifice.

You're not a girl, honey.

You're a boy who was raised

by a jacked-up meth head
of a mom,

who made you
think you were a girl

because she hates men.

I'm not a girl?

Lip.

Crying

Knock at door Debbie?

Sobs It wasn't real.

It was ketchup.

They did it
in front of everyone!

- Who?
- The girls at the pool.

Debs.
Crying

They're pretty and
boys notice them.

Well, they won't
be pretty for long.

They're gonna make
all the bad decisions

and you're gonna get to learn
from their mistakes.

Why do they have to be so mean?

Some girls are just jerks.

Like that chick
at the store yesterday.

Did I deserve that?
No.

But did I take her shit?
No way.

'Cause I'm better
than that and so are you.

Nobody fucks
with the Gallaghers.

Crying

Debbie?

Go away.

Open the door.

Deep breath

Crying

Come on.

Sobs

We gotta dig.

Rock music _



Gasps _

Oh! Oh!

I thought you took
a vow of silence.

The silence doesn't include
the internet?



You have been blogging
about me every day?

Grunts

I think I'm gonna puke.

Muscle through it.
We gotta find her.

Where'd Carl go?

Huh?

- Ninja!
- Carl! No!

No!

Explosion Aah!

- Oh, my God.
- Shit, Carl!

Car alarm blaring

That actually kinda worked.

You get those
from the fireworks stash?

- Yeah.
- Go get some more.

Ian?

Reeks out here.

Hey, listen.

Oh, man.

About all the stuff,
just with my dad, I--

Oh, my God, why are we
still talking about this?

I mean, really?
Christ.

Okay, so, like,
whenever you need me

I'm, like, there for you,
but the one time I need you,

you're like, "screw off"?

Carl thinks
he's a cancer survivor.

Molly thinks she's a girl
with a penis.

Debbie's getting terrorized
at the public pool.

This yard smells like a sewer.

I got three drunk assholes

operating power tools
behind me.

And the bitches at work

locked me in a bathroom today.

Oh!

And we might all be on the verge
of going to prison.

So you wanna talk?
Fine.

Grab a shovel.

Talk your face off
about how your dad

gave a blowjob to a teenager,

but dig while you do it.

You know what?

I'm really tired
of playing this

"my tragedy is bigger
than your tragedy" game.

My entire world got rocked,

and it's, like,
not even on your radar.

We're in a relationship!

What's important to me
should be important to you.

Look at us.

We are literally
digging up a body.

How do you even
compare our situations?

Chuckles Oh, that's great.

Walk away.

That's a real pussy move.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

So I'll just be carrying it

and you two take it from me
when it comes out?

- Yes, mama.
- 'Cause lord knows

I am too old to be
raising an infant.

It will be our child.

It will be your grandchild.

Aw, you were such a sweet baby.

But lord,
were you a terrible eater.

Chuckles

It'd get all up in your hair
and in your nose--

Everything okay?

Yeah, just a second.

Oh, this comes the tricky part.

Slapping

Groans

Not much in there.

We could've used an eyedropper.

Jeez, Kevin.

Exhales Okay.

Deebreaths

Bottoms up.

Ooh.

Warmer than I expected.

Ooh. Laughs

Okay, bedtime, gang.

We'll start again
in the morning.

Fuck.

Lighter clicks

Don't worry about your dweeb.

He's just off
licking his wounds.

He'll be back.

We Gallaghers sure know
how to pick 'em, huh?

See you in the morning.

Dialing

Phone line trilling

Voicemail beeps

Hey, Karen.
It's Lip.

Um, just wanted
to give you an update--

wherever the fuck you are.

Um, your kid, he's doing great.

Um, your mom and
ex-husband, they're--

they're also doing great.

My dad, who you fucked,

he's doing great.
And, um--

I'm doing really,
really great--

just in case
you were wondering.

You selfish, ignorant,
heinous piece of dogshit.

Thank you for leaving
and never coming back.

You-- we all owe you
a huge fucking favor!

You rock.

Hey.
Go inside?

Bring that with you.

Come on.

Sighs

Sighs

Chuckles

Hey, it's me.

Uh, just wondering
where you are.

Call, text, whatevs.
Bye.

Sighs

I mean, no wonder
she flipped out.

I mean, she's got
so much on her plate.

She needs me there for her.

I--you know, I gotta
work on my stuff too.

Si. So hard for you.

Poor Stevie.

You ready to go again?

Yeah.

Giggles

Both moaning

Fuck.

Metal clanking

I'm a dick!

Mandy?

I'm a dick.

Can you come down?

Dog barks

Hey.

I'm not a tool.

Yeah, I know.

So you don't get
to treat me like one.

I know.

Come down.

Please?

Rock music



Fireworks squealing

Hey. Whoa.
Guys, guys.

No fucking guns, all right?

It's just a drunk
old lady in there.

She's at the pool.

We gotta keep digging.

You got shot, Mickey!

Yes, I fucking know I got shot.

Remember,
do not sit on cushions,

carpets, anything foam,

Say their names slowly
and calmly.

If you feel something
crawling on you

don't scream, just shake
the body part lightly.

Okay?
Let's do this.

Tires screeching

- Come on.
- Holy shit.

- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

Groans

Fuck.

Tires screeching

I'm just gonna
take another minute.

Take your time.

- You kidding me?
- Stay there.

- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus.

Just one fucking old lady, huh?

Aah! Ow! Ow.

Children crying

Well, if it isn't
the toughest badass

fag beater this side
of the Chicago River.

Fuck off.

I'll show you some tits.

Screaming, groaning

Ian, what the fuck?

I can explain this.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturges
from Child Protective Services.

She just walked in.

Yes!

Oh, my God.

I totally almost drowned
a slut!

She was kicking and scratching,

but I held my breath
and hung on

until she passed out!

Oh, my God.
Guess what.

You do not "F"
with Debbie Gallagher!

Chuckles Don't "F" with me.

Debs.

Yeah. What?

Chuckles

Baby crying





Don't know where the fuck
you were last week,

but here's what you
missed on Shameless.

They're digging out
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones,
the police show up.

You buried a body and you stole
from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

"My dad is gay
for your brother" thing,

it's, like, on film loop
in my brain.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

We are literally
digging up a body.

Walk away.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

I need to know the truth.
Can I have a damn baby or not?

What about a surrogate?

You two take it from me
when it comes out.

Yes, mama.

It will be our child.
It will be your grandchild.

You know the guy
you beat the shit out of?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion

and take all of his crap.

Don't know what you see
in that geriatric viagroid.

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

I can take care of you at home.

No, you can't.

Get in the car.
Debbie, get in the car.

I love you, Debbie!

Operator, can you connect me
with Child Welfare Services?

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturgess
from Child Protective Services.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that

 What is this downside

Train horn blaring

Dog barking

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, what the hell's going on?

Department of Family Services
is taking us away.

They what?
Can they do that?

It won't last, Debs.
I promise.

What was it last time?
A week?

Nine days.

Aw, 20 bucks says
we're back in five.

Can I get their placement
addresses from you now?

Not until the intake interviews
with the children are complete.

Who reported us?

Engine starting

Come on! Who was it?

Sighs

Frank.

Footsteps approaching

Frank. Frank.

Frank.

I'm off to my
hypnotherapy appointment.

I need you to watch Hiram.

I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Sheils.

Where's Jody?

He's working
at the tattoo parlor.

Marking idiots with ink so the
rest of us can recognize them.

Frank, you have tattoos.

Point well taken.

So-- and if you're
doing laundry,

can you put some
of Hymie's onesie's in?

Might as well.
You're both covered in pee-pee.

Hushed laughter

Shushes

There you go, buddy.

I just want you to know that

my dumping you
and leaving town...

is in no way a reflection of my
feelings toward you, Hiram.

I just gotta lay low
a little bit

in case they find Ginger's body
in my backyard.

Exhales

Sighs

Plates clattering

Oh, shit!
I got a shift in ten minutes.

Yeah, go to your shift.
I'll take care of this.

I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

Yeah.
I wasn't either.

I'm gonna see if I can get
one of the evil cock gobblers

to cover my shift
so I can get over to the DFS

and start tracking down
the kids.

You guys okay?

Oh, yeah.

Ain't our first time
at the rodeo.

'Cause Liam's still cute
and little...

Babbling

He'll go to some loving home
with people

who really want a family,
but waited so long

their egg batter rotted so they
can't have one of their own.

And Debbie can Carl will
be placed together because...

Because the State always tries
to keep siblings together.

And Lip and I can handle
whatever foster nut jobs

we end up with.

Remember that last guy
with the, uh...

was it the fucking
bathroom peephole?

Oh, yeah.

Well, this time's gonna
be a little different.

I've placed Liam
and Carl together,

but Debbie unfortunately
has to be placed separately.

All by myself?

And, Philip and Ian,
you're too old to be placed,

so you're going
to a group home.

Like a whore's period.
Late again, bitch.

You're wasting
your talents, Patty.

You should be tweeting
this crap.

Knocks on door

You're late.

I know. I'm sorry.

Look, I kind of have
a family emergency

and was wondering if I could
skip my shift today?

Would you look at this?
It's filthy.

My back is filthy.
'Cause you haven't washed it.

So why should I wash yours?

Look, I just need
a couple hours

to get to the Department
of Family Services.

They yanked my brothers
and sister from our house

this morning, and I just gotta

find out where they are
and make sure they're safe

and not with any psychos
or anything, please.

Sorry, but if you can't get
anyone to cover your shift...

You know as well as I do
none of these bitches

are gonna cover for me.

I still have that video
of you and I have no problem

sending it to your wife.

Yeah, and I have no problem
going to DFS to tell them

you steal from the register
and show up high every day.

Your word against mine.

Actually, the girls
will back me up.

And I'm gonna want you to quit

so I don't have to
pay you unemployment.

Fuck you, Bobby.

Tell you what, you, uh,
tickle the balls a little bit

and maybe I'll write you
a letter of recommendation.

It really puts the "home"
in "group home."

Baby babbling

Dog barking in distance

It's only gonna
be a couple days, okay?

Every Gallagher
can handle that, right?

- I'll take care of Liam.
- Yes, you will.

Hey, Debs.

See you soon, all right?

Hey.

Good day, gentlemen.

My name is d'Andre
and this is Gunderson House,

a Level 14 boys group home
housing underage D&Ds

in the Chicago system.

Is that "Dungeons and Dragons"?

"Delinquents and deviants."
Follow me.

This will be your primary
residence until we figure out

which one you are.

Your wallets and cell phones
will be in my care

until you've proven to me
that you can follow the rules.

- So it's like prison?
- It's up to you.

You will be given an opportunity
to earn back your money

and your cell phone privileges.

Gee, thanks.

You would do well
to shut your mouth

and keep your eyes open
in here.

Clears throat

The county database says that
you're available for placement,

but I'm concerned there are
too many children in your care.

I'm sure there's
some kind of limit.

Kids talking indistinctly

These ain't cats, honey.
They're kids.

They need someone
to take care of them.

That's why the Good Lord
put me here.

So I can take in all his babies
don't nobody else want.

Laughs

Come here, sweetheart.

Come on,
I'm not gonna bite you.

Laughs

You're a blessing.

Mama Kamala
is truly blessed to have you.

Yup.

It's only for a few days.
I'll be okay.

Um, this is my number.

If you have any questions
or, you know, if you just

want to talk about anything,
you can call me any time, okay?

Okey-dokey.

Bye-bye, now.

Rule number one.

No sitting on
the good furniture.

This is the good furniture?

Rule number two.
No sassing. You hear me?

Let me look inside that bag.
Give me that bag.

Make sure you ain't got nothing
in there to get you in trouble.

Why are you standing there
eyeballing me?

Get busy minding them kids.

Hi.
I'm Debbie.

Laronda.

You ain't getting
your bags back.

I know.

And what's your name?

We want to be completely
honest with you, Carl.

We have been looking
to adopt a bi-racial baby

for quite some time.

And when they called about Liam,
we were over the moon.

And then the State
told us about you.

And we want to try
to keep you two together.

So let's give
this foursome a try.

Which one are you again?

I'm Cassius and this is Lanier.

So you guys are gay?

- Yup.
- Yes.

Does, like, shit ever get
stuck on the tip of your dick?

Yeah.

Uh...

Gallagher?

I was hoping to see Marilyn.

She's been our caseworker
the last couple of years.

Well, the turnover rate
in our field is quite high.

It's really a wonder Marilyn
lasted as long as she did.

So how can I help you?

You can give me the addresses
where the kids were placed.

I already told you,
I can't give out any information

about the case until
the intakes are complete.

Come on. Marilyn always
used to give me the info,

just so I can know
they're okay,

and can get them stuff,
like books or clothes,

or whatever.

Well, that is a clear
violation of policy

on Marilyn's part.

Hey. I know
you think you're helping,

but as someone who
has been in and out

of the system their whole life,

I can tell you
it's a nightmare.

These kids have a big sister
who loves them,

and I just want
to make sure they're okay.

So give me something, Britney.

I mean, break a goddamn rule.

I can tell you
that I placed two together

in one foster home,
and the girl in another.

And the two older boys
are in a group home.

The one on Hester?

No. They're in
a Level 14 on Richmond.

Thanks.

Hey, if I can find one family
willing to take in all the kids,

could they be placed together?

In theory, yes.

- Stella been in yet?
- What's with the bag?

Uh, going fishing
for a couple of days.

I heard Stella's
pulling a long haul

up to northern Canada.

Hoping to hitch a ride.

Fishing? You gonna use
your tiny dick as a worm?

I've caught some big whales
with this little worm,

yourself included there, Moby.

Hello, Stella.
How are you, sunshine?

- What the hell do you want?
- Oh, you know, same as you.

Free pussy
and a life on the road.

- Could I hitch a ride?
- Where you headed?

Anywhere but here.

- Kill somebody?
- No, no, no.

But I did bury her.

Could always use some company.

I'll meet you here
tomorrow morning

before I pick up my load.

A couple of boilermakers
to take the edge off

the long haul, huh?

I don't drink before I drive.

I end up ramming
smart cars in the ass

just for shits and giggles.

DFS took the kids this morning.

Oh, shit.

You think you and Kevin could
talk to your foster caseworker

about taking them in?

- Five Gallaghers in my house?
- Just for a couple days.

A week, maximum.

Lip and Ian got placed
in a Level 14 group home.

Level 14?

For kids that light
their parents on fire,

or stab them in the face while
they're napping on the couch.

Well, you're over 21 now.

Can't they just
release them to you?

I'd have to file
for guardianship.

in a group home before?

It's always like this?

No, last place I was in
was an actual home.

This is more like
a fucking labor camp.

Yo, give me your cash.

- What?
- Give me your cash.

Now. Come on.

Hey, Salvador, check it out.

It's that chick
from the movie Brave.

- He your boyfriend?
- No. Brother.

I'm Lip.
This is Ian.

We don't want any trouble,
all right?

We're just passing through.

Long as you show respect,
you're gonna be fine.

You're like
a fucking cockroach.

Able to live anywhere
and feed off anything.

Lemonade, man.

Door opens

- Jimmy?
- Darker.

- Hey. Talk to your caseworker?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

Two reasons why we can't
take in your brood.

One. The fact
that you had a foster child

in your home that ran away
under your "supervision."

Two. Technically, the
investigation's still pending

as to the quality of your care.

The quality of my care?

You're saying her running away
is my fault?

Oh, you know what?

Do not get all up in my grill,
sister girl, okay?

Well, it was worth a shot.

Now what?

Gotta kick it into high gear.

Figure out where
the kids are staying.

Get the house ready
for home inspection.

They're gonna require a fit
parent to get the kids back,

so I'm hoping to find Monica

so I don't have to deal
with Frank.

Why does it always
come down to Frank?

Sighs

Carl, it's dinner time.

Carl?

Where is that boy?

Oh, I'm gonna
pound your fucking hole.

Yeah. Oh, that fucker's
going up your ass.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Why don't you
get those pants off

so I can eat your fucking hole?

Why do they
all have moustaches?

Out. Now.

That was an invasion of our
privacy and we won't have it.

You are not to touch things
that don't belong to you.

Now sit down.

Am I allowed
to touch the chair?

Don't be smart.

- What the hell is this?
- Kale, brown rice, and tofu.

Your body is a temple, Carl,

and you only want to put
things in it that are natural.

Like fists?

I saw it in that movie.

Holes in your backyard
have been filled.

Hey, grandma, it's Fiona...

Gallagher.

Yeah.
Yeah, it's been a while.

Yeah, I was just wondering
if you by any chance...

maybe know where
my mom might be?

Your daughter.

Monica.

Yup.
Yeah, I figured.

But I just thought I'd try.

Okay. Thanks.

Sighs

Now what?

With no Monica,
I kind of have no choice.

I gotta find Frank.

Get him sober and ready
to appear in court.

Chuckles

He's like
my sad-ass Obi Wan Kenobi.

I can help you with that.

That's a pretty
nice offer considering

how much of a dick
I was to you about your dad.

No, you're always a dick.

Seriously, I don't mean
to be an asshole.

It's just... genetic.

Yeah. You're not wrong.

I need to suck it up
about my dad being gay...

and a liar.

And I need to get over it.
And I am.

I'm good.

Silver lining?

Huh?

Finally have the house
to ourselves.

I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling it.

You mind if we just lay here?

Yeah.
Yeah, sounds nice.

What is this stuff?

It's pus from
your mother's monkey.

Thought you liked
the taste of that.

What's your problem, dude?

Nick, Salvador,
find another table.

Come on, chop-chop.

Proof of your employment
came through,

so you go to work today.

I need your employer
to sign this, times in and out.

Understand?

You know, I'm actually
pretty excited to get out there.

- Start looking for work.
- Nice try.

You have court-mandated
community service hours you owe.

Yeah, but only a few.

Then I can get out there
and start looking for work,

so I can become
a contributing member

of our great,
capitalistic society.

You think you're better
than everyone here, don't you?

Oh, that's--
that's rhetorical, right?

I mean, you don't actually
want me to answer that, do you?

Cute. See, I could
smack you across the face.

But I think it's better
I get out of your way.

Let life bend you over instead.

Dude thinks he's in
an episode ofScared Straight.

Ethel really
fucked up our kid credit.

Yup.

Now we can't even
get a foster kid?

- Anybody can get a foster kid.
- I think it's a sign.

Jerry Sandusky could
probably get a foster kid.

It's a sign
we need to step it up

in the surrogate department.

Look, we just did
the baster thing with your mom.

Let's just see if it works.

Mama always pukes the morning
after she gets knocked up.

As a kid, it was like watching
someone take ipecac,

you could set your watch by it.

My super "spermazoa"
too much for her?

Spermatozoa.
I don't think it worked.

We need to try something else.

Frank?

God damn it, did you
sleep here last night?

Guilty.

Stella here yet?

Oh, come on.
I'm not helping you up.

Get up.

As of right now,
you are officially on the wagon.

DFS made a surprise appearance
and the kids got pulled.

It's time for your
father-of-the-year act.

Oh, my God.
Are they all right?

I'll tell you what.

Let's meet back at the house
and we'll get this all settled.

Looks heavy.

Why don't I carry this
back to the house for you?

But I need it for some errands
I'm going to run a little--

Back at the house now,

or you'll lose your kids
and the welfare checks

that come with them.

I go to the house,
the city finds Ginger's body.

I'm toast.

I found Ginger
and I tossed her bones.

You're safe.

Oh. That's great.

Not for you.

You don't do exactly as I say,
and I'll rat you out

about Aunt Ginger's checks
and your fake disability.

- You don't have the balls.
- Jesus Christ!

I need you to do this!
Can you just do this?

I'm sorry.
Did you just say you need me?

Yes! I need you
to get your shit together

and get the kids back.

Well, seeing as how
you need something from me,

maybe I need something
from you.

For starters,
I would like to be shown

the respect which I deserve.

I believe
I'm already doing that.

And this one
is non-negotiable.

I want free roam
of my own house.

Fine.

We're gonna go visit Lip
and Ian in the group home.

God knows what they've been
dealing with in that shithole.

And then we go
find your lawyer.

He has a lawyer?

Don't worry, Liam.

Soon as I steal
enough stuff from these guys,

we're outta here.

Rock music playing in car

I spent some time here.

That summer mom was sent away
for knifing a poodle.

- Hey! I missed you guys.
- Oh, yeah!

- How you holding up?
- Aw, we're fine.

The place is a joke.

They still serving
that rotten porridge?

He already on the wagon?

Oh, why do you
have to say that?

As of right now.
You out on furlough?

No, I've gotta work.
He's gotta finish parole hours.

You guys want a lift?

No, we gotta get our bus
passes signed by the driver.

- You find Debs and the boys?
- Not yet, but I will.

Do you need anything?
You need cash? Clothes?

No, no. Look, don't
worry about us, we're fine.

Worry about him.

Where's my hug?

Laughs

I'll wash, you dry.

Sneezes

Grab a cup of kool-aid
from the table.

Hey, strawberry shortcake!

Get on in here
and cut my toenails!

Groans

Okay, um, take over.

Come on, come on.

I mean, there's
just no privacy.

If I wanna jack-off,
I gotta do it in the bathroom.

Can't even begin to imagine
what a pussy you'd be in juvie.

Laughs

You fuck anyone in there yet?

God, no.

Wise choice.

Even if you're propositioned,
it's probably just a setup.

Guys want to find out
if you're gay

and pound the shit outta you.

And not in a good way.

Great.

Hey, my dad took my brothers
on a run out of town

for a couple days,
so you wanna ditch that dump

and crash at my place, you can.

Was I just invited
to a sleepover?

Fuck you,
is what you were invited to.

Laughs

Fiona here?
She's not home.

Are you okay?

Did you foster parents hurt you?
'Cause I will--

- No. We ran away.
- Honey, you can't stay here.

The police will
come looking for you.

We're with these
two gay robot guys

and they keeping talking about
how they want to swipe Liam.

Honey, you gotta go back.

I know what it's like to have
a foster kid run away on me.

Come on, I'll take you.

What if they really
want to keep Liam?

The only reason why
they would want to keep him

is if they want him,
so be sure that they don't.

Be creative.

Can you at least
hold some of my stuff?

What stuff?

Clattering

Jesus, Lou!
Laughs When did that happen?

- It's not mine.
- Get to the point, Frank.

Who's this?

My daughter and her girlfriend.

- Who's in trouble?
- DFS snatched my kids.

- I need you to get them back.
- Catch?

I have no money and no promise
of any coming my way

any time soon.

Okay.

First order of business,
you need to get your ass to DFS.

You need to file a petition
to reinstate custody

and you're gonna need to dig up

that useless wife
of yours, Monica.

It's always better
to have signatures

from two shitty parents
instead of one.

What if we can't find her?

Well, find someone
that looks like her.

And you're gonna need her
to take parenting classes.

And I'm gonna go ahead
and get the case filed.

And then I'll see you
at the hearing.

In the meantime,
no drugs, no booze.

No poppy seed bagels.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

Thanks for the phone call.

You know how hard it is
to find a public phone?

Ian managed.

Then I had to track your ass
down through the city.

Sorry, I've been busy.

Molly's mom showed up
at my house.

- Oh, she's still alive?
- Turns out Molly's a runner.

What, you just
let her take her?

Oh, I was supposed to stop her?

I don't know,
if she ran it was probably

for a good reason, no?

Or not. I used to run away
all the time when I was little.

My point exactly.

My dad's out of town
for a few days

and I told Mickey
he could have the place.

Can I stay with you?

I got to play it straight
in this group home for a bit.

Maybe I can sneak you in
tonight though.

Promise I won't get gang raped?

Nope.

Whatever, I'm in.

Why are you eating candy
before dinner?

'Cause it says here that dark
chocolate has an amino acid

that doubles your sperm count.

I didn't read that one,
but mama says

asparagus and garlic
does the trick, so tah-dah.

If I eat all that, my piss
is gonna stink for a month.

And mama's
bringing over oysters.

But we gotta think
of a better delivery system

than the turkey baster.

Squirt gun.

Kind of messy.

What about a straw?
Silly straw?

- Jacobs.
- Here.

And Weston.

Weston!

Here.

All right, good night,
you shits of Chicago!

Pricks of Illinois!

Have fun.

How did you get
the private room?

I made some friends.

Is this what it's gonna be like

when you sneak me
into your dorm in college?

A little different.

I'm guessing my dorm mates
would be literate.

You are out of your mind.

Have you seen
that fucking ponytail?

It's a powerful ponytail, man.
That's bullshit.

Segal could totally
kick Van Damme's ass.

Oh, unless-- unless...

It's Double Impact Van Damme.

'Cause that's some
Van double Damme!

Laughs

I wanna fuck Van Damme.

Movie music playing



Both: Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Kev is just gonna lie down
with you for procreation,

not sex.

- What is the difference?
- It's clinical.

So no one enjoys it.

Millions of sperm died
in that turkey baster.

This will deliver
the biggest batch.

The bigger the batch,
the better the chance.

Uh-uh. No, honey.

This is an express bus
to The Maury Povich Show.

Chuckles

I want nothing more than
to be able to give you the baby

that I know you want.

And the grandbaby
that you deserve.

But I can't.
And it kills me.

Please, just give it a go
while you're still ovulating.

Groans

What kind of hard liquor you got
and how much?

Exhales

Damn, it's hot up here.

That's because heat rises.

Then how come space is so cold?

Knock on door

Gasps I got it.

Who's at the door?
Door opens

- Hey.
- Hey, uh...

Who's at the door, baby?
Gasps

- No! Frank, no!
- Wait.

You-- first of all,
get out! Get out!

- Just hear me out.
- You are not allowed in here.

- Get out!
- DFS pinched my kids.

I need you to pretend to be
Monica to help me get them back.

What? No! No! Why should I
do anything for you?

- You left Hiram all alone.
- I am begging you.

As someone who knows what
it feels like to lose a kid.

Karen ran away.

Can you imagine what
it must feel like to have them

taken from you?

This isn't for Frank, okay?

It's for Debbie
and Carl and Liam.

Maybe you should do it,
Shelly-bear... for the kids.

Sighs

Exhales

Grunts Give it up, Kev.

You can't make it
dark enough to deny

what's about to happen in here.

I wish I was drunk as you.

No, I can't risk
the whiskey-dick.

Okay, let's get this going.

Laughs

Shh!
Knock it off, mama!

Hey, wait, wait, wait.
What's with the KKK costume?

I saw them use
something like this

at that super jewey wedding
I went to last year.

It keeps the skin from touching.
Acts as a barrier.

I feel like a ghost prostitute.

You know, like that
Jennifer Love Hewitt show.

You seen that?

You know, where she's,
like, a call girl for ghosts

or some shit.

No, that--
it's two different shows.

- All right, you two ready?
- Yeah.

No! Let me get
the hell out of here first.

I can't watch this part.

You-- you okay out there?

- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
- You need any help?

No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

Ooh. Why she didn't
cut me a mouth hole?

How am I supposed to--
whoa! Hello! Ooh!

Looks like I got
a visitor down there!

- Ooh!
- God damn it.

Whoops!
Ding dong ditch.

Somebody rang my bell
and ran away.

I feel like I'm fucking Casper.

Hey, you know,
it's getting seriously hard

to breathe under here.

- Can I take this off my face?
- No! No!

Birds chirping

Can you dump Frank at DFS?

I gotta drop some stuff off
for Carl.

Yeah, not a problem.

Let's go, Frank!
Showtime.

Been a while
since I've been in.

Maybe I need a new picture.

We had a bad meth run last year

and you know what
that stuff can do to you.

They've got a website
and everything.

Well, now that you've
filed your petition

to reinstate custody,
we'll need you to sign up

for parenting classes.

- Parenting classes?
- Good.

Also there may be
some random drug tests

and we'll need to set up
a home visit prior

to the possible
release of the children.

So I will get
the class registration.

I'll be right back.

Fucking big brother.

I don't want any goddamn
parenting classes.

What are they?

You sit in a room
and they lecture you

how to be Ozzie and Harriet.

I was thinking
maybe I could figure out

where I went wrong with Karen.

Kids come pre-wired,

it has nothing to do
with your parenting.

I pretty much like
being a blonde.

I feel like cotton candy.

Hi.

Uh, my name's Fiona Gallagher.
I'm here to visit Debbie.

Is she here?

- Are you her mother?
- Sister.

I just want to say hi.
May I see her?

I just want to talk to her!

Hey.

Do all your talking out here.

I'm gonna need her back
in 15 for chores.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Are there a million kids
in there?

Just a few,
but they're really nice.

And Kamala's not so bad.

Bed's pretty comfortable
and there's hot water.

Sighs

I brought you some books
and clothes.

- Do you need any money?
- Nope. I'm good.

Zipper

When do you think
we can go back home?

Soon.
Real soon.

I brought you some
Hershey's Kisses too.

These were like gold when
I was in my first foster home.

Thanks.

Breezy pop music



Hey, I got your brother's
working papers for today.

Oh, great.
I'll give them to him. Thanks.

- Where is he?
- Uh, latrine.

He's been there
most of the night.

Turns out eating diarrhea can
actually give you diarrhea, so...

Signed.
In and out.

And I better
see him at lights out.

That's it, Liam.
Big circles.

Urine tinkling

Doorbell rings

Please, come in.

Carl! Liam!
You have a visitor!

- Hi there, I'm Lanier.
- Hey, Fiona Gallagher.

Baby babbling Fiona!

Hey!
Look at you two!

Hey!

Wow, you look so clean.

Yeah, they make us
take baths every night.

And they have this weird toilet
that cleans your bits.

A "bidet."

Laughs
Sometimes in the summer

we use a whacky lawn
sprinkler for that, but...

Laughs we gotta watch
the spinning arms, right?

We gotta watch
those spinning arms.

Please, come.
Have a seat.

It's nice to see that the boys
have someone who loves them.

We're glad you came.

But just to make it clear,
we have filed the paperwork

to adopt Liam.

And we're seriously
considering adopting Carl too.

But please know that we'd
love for you to stay in contact

and visit as often
as you'd like.

We think it's important
for the boys to know

where they come from.

Why is my seat wet?

Oh, no, Liam. Did you
pee on the couch again?

Was that you?
And the wall too?

Liam, that is a matte finish!

How the hell are we
gonna get that out?

It's just paint, honey.
I can touch it up.

Now which color is that now?
Summer shadow?

He's just a baby.
He didn't mean it.

Babies are just so messy.

Baby babbling
Did you do that?

- Did you do that?
- A boat.

All right, I gotta get to work.

All right, just--
in a minute, okay?

Wanna do the honors?

- Is that a rosary for giants?
- No.

- Huh?
- No.

No, man, they're Ben Wa beads.

You shove them in my ass
and you pull them out real slow.

- How is that fun for me?
- Come on.

All right, okay.
Just easy on the injured cheek.

I'll just go on the other one,
all right?

- Yeah.
- Relax.

were you so late?

I was fucking mom's boyfriend.
What do you care?

You're nothing but
a little tramp, you know that?

Just like your mother.

You know what, if you
weren't stealing from her,

maybe she wouldn't have to screw
every Tom, Dick and Harry--

That bitch gave me herpes!

As far as I'm concerned,
I deserve every single dime.

- She did not have herpes.
- She fucking well did too.

How was that?

Okay. Where's the sheet?

No. No, I couldn't
breathe last time.

Well, we gotta put
a Guantanamo hood on her

or something.

I don't know why I can't drink.

Okay, shut up!
It's hard for all of us.

So both of you, shut up!

Now everyone
get in your positions.

Snapping fingers

All right.

Oh, come on, man!

Don't do this,
you piece of shit!

you smell pork chops.

Yelling at it
is not gonna help.

Come here.

Oh, there we go.

- Ow!
- Come on, you piece of shit!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
God, baby! You can't do that.

You're gonna build up calluses

and I won't be able
to feel dick.

Well, right now,
no one's feeling dick!

- You think this is easy?
- It's all my fault!

You can't make

I've lost all my stripes.

Mama, this is not
about you losing anything.

Cries

It's really me.
I'm under a lot of pressure.

- No.
- It's all me, mama.

I haven't had a date in months!

I'm old and fat
and unattractive

and I'm gonna die alone.

No, mama.
Cries

Well, this is not
helping me get hard.

Cries

Sighs It's like
when a plane goes down.

- What do they call that?
- Shitty?

No, it's never just
one thing that causes it.

It's a chain reaction.

Cascading failures.
That's what this feels like.

Losing my job, losing the kids,

dealing with Frank.

Sighs

Someone recently told me
to stop whining

and feeling sorry for myself.

Chuckles
She sounds like a bitch.

Well, she has her moments.

Legally and morally there are
acceptable methods of punishment

for children,
versus unacceptable methods.

Uh, I'm sorry.

Just hypothetically, if one's
teenage daughter gave birth

to a baby with Downs Syndrome
and then took off,

relieving her
of all responsibility,

if and when
she should come back,

would you recommend grounding?

Or in that instance would
a firm spanking be more...

You know, before
we take any more questions,

let's just go over some
of the basic...

- Would you give me a Valium?
- No, I only have one.

And it's my safety net in case
my hypnotherapy doesn't work.

Hypnotherapy is just paying
to nap in someone's office.

Give me a pill.

It's gonna show up
in your urine test.

- Give me the goddamn pill.
- What's the matter with you?

What this does is it
puts the responsibility

- right on the child.
- Okay. Come on.

Your job as parents
is to define the rules...

- Here. Christ.
- And then lay out

the consequences
that will follow

when those rules are broken.

Now the child breaking the rules
is then responsible

for his or her
own consequences.

And this method actually
leads to empowerment

and helps him or her feel more
in control of their own lives.

How is she still ovulating?
What is she, part bovine?

- Shh. Focus on me.
- Mm.

Yeah, now you're gonna pretend
like you're in high school

and you're gonna come quickly
like a rabbit, okay?

- Ooh, yeah.
- No, not that quick.

Mama, get in here!

Mm.

Grunts

- No. Not there, honey, no.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

You gotta shoehorn
or something?

Can you not talk, please?
Just don't say a word.

Cries

Are you crying?
Oh, God, she's crying.

Please don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry, mama.
Hey, hey, hey.

Okay! That's it!

We're gonna do this shit
and we're gonna be done with it.

Kev, get that dick hard.

Mama, wipe your
tears and focus!

We need to give those little
spermies someplace happy

to swim to.

Lay down!

Mm.

What's your name?

Frank, wasn't the last time
I had to pee in a cup

when I was pregnant with Liam?

Remember that?
It was just like yesterday, huh?

Oh.

Uh, sorry, the shower
ran out of hot water.

Mama, you want Kevin
to take you home?

Well, he can't drive
with that leg.

No, but he can get
you home in a taxi.

It's the least we can do.

Well, let me get my bag.

Knock at door

- Hey, Carol.
- Hey, Fiona.

- Any work at the salon?
- Uh, not right now, baby.

- But I'll keep you in mind.
- Thanks.

Door closes

What was she doing here
so early?

She slept over
after she and Kevin had sex.

What?

Mama's the best surrogate
we got.

Turkey baster didn't work

so we had to do it
the old-fashioned way.

Jesus, V, I'm so wrapped up
in my own pity party,

I had no idea what kind
of biblical shit

you had going on here.

You okay?

If it works, I'll be fine.

How's Frank doing in rehab?

So far he seems
to be holding it together.

Heading over to DFS now
to make sure

he got all the paperwork in.

What's with all the asparagus?

You know how popeye
gets all big and strong

when he eats his spinach?

Mm-hm.

That's what asparagus
does for sperm.

Hm.

- You again.
- Me again.

Just wanted to make sure
Frank showed up

and all our paperwork
was good to go.

He did. He passed his
urine test with flying colors.

And yes, your paperwork
is all set.

So now we just wait
for a hearing?

Yeah.

You've done good, Fiona.
You are a great sister.

And those kids
are lucky to have you.

How did we show up
on DFS radar?

It was an anonymous
phone call, actually.

Chuckles
I bet it was that bitch

we turned away from daycare
'cause her kid stunk.

Um, no.

- It was a man, actually.
- A man?

It's never a man.
Men don't give a shit.

How is it fair that someone
can make one call

and completely ruin our lives,
and they get to be anonymous?

I have to go to the restroom.

I'd appreciate it
if you didn't click on this file

while I'm gone.

Frank: Yes, hello,
I would like to report

a negligent situation.

2119 North Wallace.

Gallagher.

Female:
And what's the situation?

Frank: Six kids living
in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.
Not that they don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, vile--

Female: - Excuse me, sir.
Frank: - What?

Female: Could you give me
your name, please?

Frank: No.
If it's all right,

I would like
to remain anonymous.

Female: Thank you for bringing
this to our attention.

Frank: No. Thank you.
And God bless you.

 Don't believe the lies

 your echoing heartbeat,
echoing heartbeat

 keeps our time


Don't know where the fuck
you were last week,

but here's what you
missed on Shameless.

They're digging out
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones,
the police show up.

You buried a body and you stole
from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

"My dad is gay
for your brother" thing,

it's, like, on film loop
in my brain.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

We are literally
digging up a body.

Walk away.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

I need to know the truth.
Can I have a damn baby or not?

What about a surrogate?

You two take it from me
when it comes out.

Yes, mama.

It will be our child.
It will be your grandchild.

You know the guy
you beat the shit out of?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion

and take all of his crap.

Don't know what you see
in that geriatric viagroid.

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

I can take care of you at home.

No, you can't.

Get in the car.
Debbie, get in the car.

I love you, Debbie!

Operator, can you connect me
with Child Welfare Services?

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturgess
from Child Protective Services.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Train horn blaring

Dog barking

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, what the hell's going on?

Department of Family Services
is taking us away.

They what?
Can they do that?

It won't last, Debs.
I promise.

What was it last time?
A week?

Nine days.

Aw, 20 bucks says
we're back in five.

Can I get their placement
addresses from you now?

Not until the intake interviews
with the children are complete.

Who reported us?

Engine starting

Come on! Who was it?

Sighs

Frank.

Footsteps approaching

Frank. Frank.

Frank.

I'm off to my
hypnotherapy appointment.

I need you to watch Hiram.

I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Sheils.

Where's Jody?

He's working
at the tattoo parlor.

Marking idiots with ink so the
rest of us can recognize them.

Frank, you have tattoos.

Point well taken.

So-- and if you're
doing laundry,

can you put some
of Hymie's onesie's in?

Might as well.
You're both covered in pee-pee.

Hushed laughter

Shushes

There you go, buddy.

I just want you to know that

my dumping you
and leaving town...

is in no way a reflection of my
feelings toward you, Hiram.

I just gotta lay low
a little bit

in case they find Ginger's body
in my backyard.

Exhales

Sighs

Plates clattering

Oh, shit!
I got a shift in ten minutes.

Yeah, go to your shift.
I'll take care of this.

I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

Yeah.
I wasn't either.

I'm gonna see if I can get
one of the evil cock gobblers

to cover my shift
so I can get over to the DFS

and start tracking down
the kids.

You guys okay?

Oh, yeah.

Ain't our first time
at the rodeo.

'Cause Liam's still cute
and little...

Babbling

He'll go to some loving home
with people

who really want a family,
but waited so long

their egg batter rotted so they
can't have one of their own.

And Debbie can Carl will
be placed together because...

Because the State always tries
to keep siblings together.

And Lip and I can handle
whatever foster nut jobs

we end up with.

Remember that last guy
with the, uh...

was it the fucking
bathroom peephole?

Oh, yeah.

Well, this time's gonna
be a little different.

I've placed Liam
and Carl together,

but Debbie unfortunately
has to be placed separately.

All by myself?

And, Philip and Ian,
you're too old to be placed,

so you're going
to a group home.

Like a whore's period.
Late again, bitch.

You're wasting
your talents, Patty.

You should be tweeting
this crap.

Knocks on door

You're late.

I know. I'm sorry.

Look, I kind of have
a family emergency

and was wondering if I could
skip my shift today?

Would you look at this?
It's filthy.

My back is filthy.
'Cause you haven't washed it.

So why should I wash yours?

Look, I just need
a couple hours

to get to the Department
of Family Services.

They yanked my brothers
and sister from our house

this morning, and I just gotta

find out where they are
and make sure they're safe

and not with any psychos
or anything, please.

Sorry, but if you can't get
anyone to cover your shift...

You know as well as I do
none of these bitches

are gonna cover for me.

I still have that video
of you and I have no problem

sending it to your wife.

Yeah, and I have no problem
going to DFS to tell them

you steal from the register
and show up high every day.

Your word against mine.

Actually, the girls
will back me up.

And I'm gonna want you to quit

so I don't have to
pay you unemployment.

Fuck you, Bobby.

Tell you what, you, uh,
tickle the balls a little bit

and maybe I'll write you
a letter of recommendation.

It really puts the "home"
in "group home."

Baby babbling

Dog barking in distance

It's only gonna
be a couple days, okay?

Every Gallagher
can handle that, right?

- I'll take care of Liam.
- Yes, you will.

Hey, Debs.

See you soon, all right?

Hey.

Good day, gentlemen.

My name is d'Andre
and this is Gunderson House,

a Level 14 boys group home
housing underage D&Ds

in the Chicago system.

Is that "Dungeons and Dragons"?

"Delinquents and deviants."
Follow me.

This will be your primary
residence until we figure out

which one you are.

Your wallets and cell phones
will be in my care

until you've proven to me
that you can follow the rules.

- So it's like prison?
- It's up to you.

You will be given an opportunity
to earn back your money

and your cell phone privileges.

Gee, thanks.

You would do well
to shut your mouth

and keep your eyes open
in here.

Clears throat

The county database says that
you're available for placement,

but I'm concerned there are
too many children in your care.

I'm sure there's
some kind of limit.

Kids talking indistinctly

These ain't cats, honey.
They're kids.

They need someone
to take care of them.

That's why the Good Lord
put me here.

So I can take in all his babies
don't nobody else want.

Laughs

Come here, sweetheart.

Come on,
I'm not gonna bite you.

Laughs

You're a blessing.

Mama Kamala
is truly blessed to have you.

Yup.

It's only for a few days.
I'll be okay.

Um, this is my number.

If you have any questions
or, you know, if you just

want to talk about anything,
you can call me any time, okay?

Okey-dokey.

Bye-bye, now.

Rule number one.

No sitting on
the good furniture.

This is the good furniture?

Rule number two.
No sassing. You hear me?

Let me look inside that bag.
Give me that bag.

Make sure you ain't got nothing
in there to get you in trouble.

Why are you standing there
eyeballing me?

Get busy minding them kids.

Hi.
I'm Debbie.

Laronda.

You ain't getting
your bags back.

I know.

And what's your name?

We want to be completely
honest with you, Carl.

We have been looking
to adopt a bi-racial baby

for quite some time.

And when they called about Liam,
we were over the moon.

And then the State
told us about you.

And we want to try
to keep you two together.

So let's give
this foursome a try.

Which one are you again?

I'm Cassius and this is Lanier.

So you guys are gay?

- Yup.
- Yes.

Does, like, shit ever get
stuck on the tip of your dick?

Yeah.

Uh...

Gallagher?

I was hoping to see Marilyn.

She's been our caseworker
the last couple of years.

Well, the turnover rate
in our field is quite high.

It's really a wonder Marilyn
lasted as long as she did.

So how can I help you?

You can give me the addresses
where the kids were placed.

I already told you,
I can't give out any information

about the case until
the intakes are complete.

Come on. Marilyn always
used to give me the info,

just so I can know
they're okay,

and can get them stuff,
like books or clothes,

or whatever.

Well, that is a clear
violation of policy

on Marilyn's part.

Hey. I know
you think you're helping,

but as someone who
has been in and out

of the system their whole life,

I can tell you
it's a nightmare.

These kids have a big sister
who loves them,

and I just want
to make sure they're okay.

So give me something, Britney.

I mean, break a goddamn rule.

I can tell you
that I placed two together

in one foster home,
and the girl in another.

And the two older boys
are in a group home.

The one on Hester?

No. They're in
a Level 14 on Richmond.

Thanks.

Hey, if I can find one family
willing to take in all the kids,

could they be placed together?

In theory, yes.

- Stella been in yet?
- What's with the bag?

Uh, going fishing
for a couple of days.

I heard Stella's
pulling a long haul

up to northern Canada.

Hoping to hitch a ride.

Fishing? You gonna use
your tiny dick as a worm?

I've caught some big whales
with this little worm,

yourself included there, Moby.

Hello, Stella.
How are you, sunshine?

- What the hell do you want?
- Oh, you know, same as you.

Free pussy
and a life on the road.

- Could I hitch a ride?
- Where you headed?

Anywhere but here.

- Kill somebody?
- No, no, no.

But I did bury her.

Could always use some company.

I'll meet you here
tomorrow morning

before I pick up my load.

A couple of boilermakers
to take the edge off

the long haul, huh?

I don't drink before I drive.

I end up ramming
smart cars in the ass

just for shits and giggles.

DFS took the kids this morning.

Oh, shit.

You think you and Kevin could
talk to your foster caseworker

about taking them in?

- Five Gallaghers in my house?
- Just for a couple days.

A week, maximum.

Lip and Ian got placed
in a Level 14 group home.

Level 14?

For kids that light
their parents on fire,

or stab them in the face while
they're napping on the couch.

Well, you're over 21 now.

Can't they just
release them to you?

I'd have to file
for guardianship.

Groans Five Gallaghers.

I'm gonna be the lone black dot

You been
in a group home before?

It's always like this?

No, last place I was in
was an actual home.

This is more like
a fucking labor camp.

Yo, give me your cash.

- What?
- Give me your cash.

Now. Come on.

Hey, Salvador, check it out.

It's that chick
from the movie Brave.

- He your boyfriend?
- No. Brother.

I'm Lip.
This is Ian.

We don't want any trouble,
all right?

We're just passing through.

Long as you show respect,
you're gonna be fine.

You're like
a fucking cockroach.

Able to live anywhere
and feed off anything.

Lemonade, man.

Exhales

Cries

Grunts

Sighs

Door opens

- Jimmy?
- Darker.

- Hey. Talk to your caseworker?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

Two reasons why we can't
take in your brood.

One. The fact
that you had a foster child

in your home that ran away
under your "supervision."

Two. Technically, the
investigation's still pending

as to the quality of your care.

The quality of my care?

You're saying her running away
is my fault?

Oh, you know what?

Do not get all up in my grill,
sister girl, okay?

Well, it was worth a shot.

Now what?

Gotta kick it into high gear.

Figure out where
the kids are staying.

Get the house ready
for home inspection.

They're gonna require a fit
parent to get the kids back,

so I'm hoping to find Monica

so I don't have to deal
with Frank.

Why does it always
come down to Frank?

Sighs

Carl, it's dinner time.

Carl?

Where is that boy?

Oh, I'm gonna
pound your fucking hole.

Yeah. Oh, that fucker's
going up your ass.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Why don't you
get those pants off

so I can eat your fucking hole?

Why do they
all have moustaches?

Out. Now.

That was an invasion of our
privacy and we won't have it.

You are not to touch things
that don't belong to you.

Now sit down.

Am I allowed
to touch the chair?

Don't be smart.

- What the hell is this?
- Kale, brown rice, and tofu.

Your body is a temple, Carl,

and you only want to put
things in it that are natural.

Like fists?

I saw it in that movie.
Sighs

Yeah.
Yeah, it's been a while.

Yeah, I was just wondering
if you by any chance...

maybe know where
my mom might be?

Your daughter.

Monica.

Yup.
Yeah, I figured.

But I just thought I'd try.

Okay. Thanks.

Sighs

Now what?

With no Monica,
I kind of have no choice.

I gotta find Frank.

Get him sober and ready
to appear in court.

Chuckles

He's like
my sad-ass Obi Wan Kenobi.

I can help you with that.

That's a pretty
nice offer considering

how much of a dick
I was to you about your dad.

No, you're always a dick.

Seriously, I don't mean
to be an asshole.

It's just... genetic.

Yeah. You're not wrong.

I need to suck it up
about my dad being gay...

and a liar.

And I need to get over it.
And I am.

I'm good.

Silver lining?

Huh?

Finally have the house
to ourselves.

I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling it.

You mind if we just lay here?

Yeah.
Yeah, sounds nice.

What is this stuff?

It's pus from
your mother's monkey.

Thought you liked
the taste of that.

What's your problem, dude?

Nick, Salvador,
find another table.

Come on, chop-chop.

Proof of your employment
came through,

so you go to work today.

I need your employer
to sign this, times in and out.

Understand?

You know, I'm actually
pretty excited to get out there.

- Start looking for work.
- Nice try.

You have court-mandated
community service hours you owe.

Yeah, but only a few.

Then I can get out there
and start looking for work,

so I can become
a contributing member

of our great,
capitalistic society.

You think you're better
than everyone here, don't you?

Oh, that's--
that's rhetorical, right?

I mean, you don't actually
want me to answer that, do you?

Cute. See, I could
smack you across the face.

But I think it's better
I get out of your way.

Let life bend you over instead.

Dude thinks he's in
an episode ofScared Straight.

Ethel really
fucked up our kid credit.

Yup.

Now we can't even
get a foster kid?

- Anybody can get a foster kid.
- I think it's a sign.

Jerry Sandusky could
probably get a foster kid.

It's a sign
we need to step it up

in the surrogate department.

Look, we just did
the baster thing with your mom.

Let's just see if it works.

Mama always pukes the morning
after she gets knocked up.

As a kid, it was like watching
someone take ipecac,

you could set your watch by it.

My super "spermazoa"
too much for her?

Spermatozoa.
I don't think it worked.

We need to try something else.

Frank?

God damn it, did you
sleep here last night?

Guilty.

Stella here yet?

Oh, come on.
I'm not helping you up.

Get up.

As of right now,
you are officially on the wagon.

DFS made a surprise appearance
and the kids got pulled.

It's time for your
father-of-the-year act.

Oh, my God.
Are they all right?

I'll tell you what.

Let's meet back at the house
and we'll get this all settled.

Looks heavy.

Why don't I carry this
back to the house for you?

But I need it for some errands
I'm going to run a little--

Back at the house now,

or you'll lose your kids
and the welfare checks

that come with them.

I go to the house,
the city finds Ginger's body.

I'm toast.

I found Ginger
and I tossed her bones.

You're safe.

Oh. That's great.

Not for you.

You don't do exactly as I say,
and I'll rat you out

about Aunt Ginger's checks
and your fake disability.

- You don't have the balls.
- Jesus Christ!

I need you to do this!
Can you just do this?

I'm sorry.
Did you just say you need me?

Yes! I need you
to get your shit together

and get the kids back.

Well, seeing as how
you need something from me,

maybe I need something
from you.

For starters,
I would like to be shown

the respect which I deserve.

I believe
I'm already doing that.

And this one
is non-negotiable.

I want free roam
of my own house.

Fine.

We're gonna go visit Lip
and Ian in the group home.

God knows what they've been
dealing with in that shithole.

And then we go
find your lawyer.

He has a lawyer?

Don't worry, Liam.

Soon as I steal
enough stuff from these guys,

we're outta here.

Rock music playing in car

I spent some time here.

That summer mom was sent away
for knifing a poodle.

- Hey! I missed you guys.
- Oh, yeah!

- How you holding up?
- Aw, we're fine.

The place is a joke.

They still serving
that rotten porridge?

He already on the wagon?

Oh, why do you
have to say that?

As of right now.
You out on furlough?

No, I've gotta work.
He's gotta finish parole hours.

You guys want a lift?

No, we gotta get our bus
passes signed by the driver.

- You find Debs and the boys?
- Not yet, but I will.

Do you need anything?
You need cash? Clothes?

No, no. Look, don't
worry about us, we're fine.

Worry about him.

Where's my hug?

Laughs

I'll wash, you dry.

Sneezes

Grab a cup of kool-aid
from the table.

Hey, strawberry shortcake!

Get on in here
and cut my toenails!

Groans

Okay, um, take over.

Come on, come on.

I mean, there's
just no privacy.

If I wanna jack-off,
I gotta do it in the bathroom.

Can't even begin to imagine
what a pussy you'd be in juvie.

Laughs

You fuck anyone in there yet?

God, no.

Wise choice.

Even if you're propositioned,
it's probably just a setup.

Guys want to find out
if you're gay

and pound the shit outta you.

And not in a good way.

Great.

Hey, my dad took my brothers
on a run out of town

for a couple days,
so you wanna ditch that dump

and crash at my place, you can.

Was I just invited
to a sleepover?

Fuck you,
is what you were invited to.

Laughs

Fiona here?
She's not home.

Are you okay?

Did you foster parents hurt you?
'Cause I will--

- No. We ran away.
- Honey, you can't stay here.

The police will
come looking for you.

We're with these
two gay robot guys

and they keeping talking about
how they want to swipe Liam.

Honey, you gotta go back.

I know what it's like to have
a foster kid run away on me.

Come on, I'll take you.

What if they really
want to keep Liam?

The only reason why
they would want to keep him

is if they want him,
so be sure that they don't.

Be creative.

Can you at least
hold some of my stuff?

What stuff?

Clattering

Jesus, Lou!
Laughs When did that happen?

- It's not mine.
- Get to the point, Frank.

Who's this?

My daughter and her girlfriend.

- Who's in trouble?
- DFS snatched my kids.

- I need you to get them back.
- Catch?

I have no money and no promise
of any coming my way

any time soon.

Okay.

First order of business,
you need to get your ass to DFS.

You need to file a petition
to reinstate custody

and you're gonna need to dig up

that useless wife
of yours, Monica.

It's always better
to have signatures

from two shitty parents
instead of one.

What if we can't find her?

Well, find someone
that looks like her.

And you're gonna need her
to take parenting classes.

And I'm gonna go ahead
and get the case filed.

And then I'll see you
at the hearing.

In the meantime,
no drugs, no booze.

No poppy seed bagels.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

Thanks for the phone call.

You know how hard it is
to find a public phone?

Ian managed.

Then I had to track your ass
down through the city.

Sorry, I've been busy.

Molly's mom showed up
at my house.

- Oh, she's still alive?
- Turns out Molly's a runner.

What, you just
let her take her?

Oh, I was supposed to stop her?

I don't know,
if she ran it was probably

for a good reason, no?

Or not. I used to run away
all the time when I was little.

My point exactly.

My dad's out of town
for a few days

and I told Mickey
he could have the place.

Can I stay with you?

I got to play it straight
in this group home for a bit.

Maybe I can sneak you in
tonight though.

Promise I won't get gang raped?

Nope.

Whatever, I'm in.

Why are you eating candy
before dinner?

'Cause it says here that dark
chocolate has an amino acid

that doubles your sperm count.

I didn't read that one,
but mama says

asparagus and garlic
does the trick, so tah-dah.

If I eat all that, my piss
is gonna stink for a month.

And mama's
bringing over oysters.

But we gotta think
of a better delivery system

than the turkey baster.

Squirt gun.

Kind of messy.

What about a straw?
Silly straw?

- Jacobs.
- Here.

And Weston.

Weston!

Here.

All right, good night,
you shits of Chicago!

Pricks of Illinois!

Have fun.

How did you get
the private room?

I made some friends.

Is this what it's gonna be like

when you sneak me
into your dorm in college?

A little different.

I'm guessing my dorm mates
would be literate.

You are out of your mind.

Have you seen
that fucking ponytail?

It's a powerful ponytail, man.
That's bullshit.

Segal could totally
kick Van Damme's ass.

Oh, unless-- unless...

It's Double Impact Van Damme.

'Cause that's some
Van double Damme!

Laughs

I wanna fuck Van Damme.

Movie music playing



Both: Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Kev is just gonna lie down
with you for procreation,

not sex.

- What is the difference?
- It's clinical.

So no one enjoys it.

Millions of sperm died
in that turkey baster.

This will deliver
the biggest batch.

The bigger the batch,
the better the chance.

Uh-uh. No, honey.

This is an express bus
to The Maury Povich Show.

Chuckles

I want nothing more than
to be able to give you the baby

that I know you want.

And the grandbaby
that you deserve.

But I can't.
And it kills me.

Please, just give it a go
while you're still ovulating.

Groans

What kind of hard liquor you got
and how much?

Exhales

Damn, it's hot up here.

That's because heat rises.

Then how come space is so cold?

Knock on door

Gasps I got it.

Who's at the door?
Door opens

- Hey.
- Hey, uh...

Who's at the door, baby?
Gasps

- No! Frank, no!
- Wait.

You-- first of all,
get out! Get out!

- Just hear me out.
- You are not allowed in here.

- Get out!
- DFS pinched my kids.

I need you to pretend to be
Monica to help me get them back.

What? No! No! Why should I
do anything for you?

- You left Hiram all alone.
- I am begging you.

As someone who knows what
it feels like to lose a kid.

Karen ran away.

Can you imagine what
it must feel like to have them

taken from you?

This isn't for Frank, okay?

It's for Debbie
and Carl and Liam.

Maybe you should do it,
Shelly-bear... for the kids.

Sighs

Exhales

Grunts Give it up, Kev.

You can't make it
dark enough to deny

what's about to happen in here.

I wish I was drunk as you.

No, I can't risk
the whiskey-dick.

Okay, let's get this going.

Laughs

Shh!
Knock it off, mama!

Hey, wait, wait, wait.
What's with the KKK costume?

I saw them use
something like this

at that super jewey wedding
I went to last year.

It keeps the skin from touching.
Acts as a barrier.

I feel like a ghost prostitute.

You know, like that
Jennifer Love Hewitt show.

You seen that?

You know, where she's,
like, a call girl for ghosts

or some shit.

No, that--
it's two different shows.

- All right, you two ready?
- Yeah.

No! Let me get
the hell out of here first.

I can't watch this part.

You-- you okay out there?

- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
- You need any help?

No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

Ooh. Why she didn't
cut me a mouth hole?

How am I supposed to--
whoa! Hello! Ooh!

Looks like I got
a visitor down there!

- Ooh!
- God damn it.

Whoops!
Ding dong ditch.

Somebody rang my bell
and ran away.

I feel like I'm fucking Casper.

Hey, you know,
it's getting seriously hard

to breathe under here.

- Can I take this off my face?
- No! No!

Birds chirping

Can you dump Frank at DFS?

I gotta drop some stuff off
for Carl.

Yeah, not a problem.

Let's go, Frank!
Showtime.

Been a while
since I've been in.

Maybe I need a new picture.

We had a bad meth run last year

and you know what
that stuff can do to you.

They've got a website
and everything.

Well, now that you've
filed your petition

to reinstate custody,
we'll need you to sign up

for parenting classes.

- Parenting classes?
- Good.

Also there may be
some random drug tests

and we'll need to set up
a home visit prior

to the possible
release of the children.

So I will get
the class registration.

I'll be right back.

Fucking big brother.

I don't want any goddamn
parenting classes.

What are they?

You sit in a room
and they lecture you

how to be Ozzie and Harriet.

I was thinking
maybe I could figure out

where I went wrong with Karen.

Kids come pre-wired,

it has nothing to do
with your parenting.

I pretty much like
being a blonde.

I feel like cotton candy.

Hi.

Uh, my name's Fiona Gallagher.
I'm here to visit Debbie.

Is she here?

- Are you her mother?
- Sister.

I just want to say hi.
May I see her?

I just want to talk to her!

Hey.

Do all your talking out here.

I'm gonna need her back
in 15 for chores.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Are there a million kids
in there?

Just a few,
but they're really nice.

And Kamala's not so bad.

Bed's pretty comfortable
and there's hot water.

Sighs

I brought you some books
and clothes.

- Do you need any money?
- Nope. I'm good.

Zipper

When do you think
we can go back home?

Soon.
Real soon.

I brought you some
Hershey's Kisses too.

These were like gold when
I was in my first foster home.

Thanks.

Breezy pop music



Hey, I got your brother's
working papers for today.

Oh, great.
I'll give them to him. Thanks.

- Where is he?
- Uh, latrine.

He's been there
most of the night.

Turns out eating diarrhea can
actually give you diarrhea, so...

Signed.
In and out.

And I better
see him at lights out.

That's it, Liam.
Big circles.

Urine tinkling

Doorbell rings

Please, come in.

Carl! Liam!
You have a visitor!

- Hi there, I'm Lanier.
- Hey, Fiona Gallagher.

Baby babbling Fiona!

Hey!
Look at you two!

Hey!

Wow, you look so clean.

Yeah, they make us
take baths every night.

And they have this weird toilet
that cleans your bits.

A "bidet."

Laughs
Sometimes in the summer

we use a whacky lawn
sprinkler for that, but...

Laughs we gotta watch
the spinning arms, right?

We gotta watch
those spinning arms.

Please, come.
Have a seat.

It's nice to see that the boys
have someone who loves them.

We're glad you came.

But just to make it clear,
we have filed the paperwork

to adopt Liam.

And we're seriously
considering adopting Carl too.

But please know that we'd
love for you to stay in contact

and visit as often
as you'd like.

We think it's important
for the boys to know

where they come from.

Why is my seat wet?

Oh, no, Liam. Did you
pee on the couch again?

Was that you?
And the wall too?

Liam, that is a matte finish!

How the hell are we
gonna get that out?

It's just paint, honey.
I can touch it up.

Now which color is that now?
Summer shadow?

He's just a baby.
He didn't mean it.

Babies are just so messy.

Baby babbling
Did you do that?

- Did you do that?
- A boat.

All right, I gotta get to work.

All right, just--
in a minute, okay?

Wanna do the honors?

- Is that a rosary for giants?
- No.

- Huh?
- No.

No, man, they're Ben Wa beads.

You shove them in my ass
and you pull them out real slow.

- How is that fun for me?
- Come on.

All right, okay.
Just easy on the injured cheek.

I'll just go on the other one,
all right?

- Yeah.
- Relax.

Grunts

Both grunting

- Fuck.
- Shit.

What the fuck?

Electronic music

Dad! Dad!
Hold on! Hold on!

- Mandy wasn't enough for you?
- Dad, hold on!

Fucking piece of shit!
Piece of shit!

Huh? Huh?

Get the fuck off him!

No son of mine is gonna
be a goddamn AIDS monkey!

Sit your ass down,

It's Terry.
Send over the Russian.

Okay, role play.

All right, Monica, Frank.

Okay, Monica, you play
the teenage daughter.

And, Frank, you be the father
disciplining her

for staying out after curfew.

Um, where the hell
were you so late?

I was fucking mom's boyfriend.
What do you care?

You're nothing but
a little tramp, you know that?

Just like your mother.

You know what, if you
weren't stealing from her,

maybe she wouldn't have to screw
every Tom, Dick and Harry--

That bitch gave me herpes!

As far as I'm concerned,
I deserve every single dime.

- She did not have herpes.
- She fucking well did too.

How was that?

That one.

She's gonna fuck the faggot
out of you, kid.

Ride him till
he likes it, Suka.

And you're goddamn gonna watch.

How many more times
are we gonna have to do this?

Until we complete the mission.
Now, come on, baby.

You're Luke Skywalker
and it's up to you

to shoot one in
and destroy the Death Star!

Okay. Where's the sheet?

No. No, I couldn't
breathe last time.

Well, we gotta put
a Guantanamo hood on her

or something.

I don't know why I can't drink.

Okay, shut up!
It's hard for all of us.

So both of you, shut up!

Now everyone
get in your positions.

Snapping fingers

All right.

Sighs

Oh, come on, man!

Don't do this,
you piece of shit!

You get hard when
you smell pork chops.

Yelling at it
is not gonna help.

Come here.

Oh, there we go.

- Ow!
- Come on, you piece of shit!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
God, baby! You can't do that.

You're gonna build up calluses

and I won't be able
to feel dick.

Well, right now,
no one's feeling dick!

- You think this is easy?
- It's all my fault!

You can't make
the little soldier salute

if he doesn't see an officer
in the room.

Cries
I've lost all my stripes.

Mama, this is not
about you losing anything.

Cries

It's really me.
I'm under a lot of pressure.

- No.
- It's all me, mama.

I haven't had a date in months!

I'm old and fat
and unattractive

and I'm gonna die alone.

No, mama.
Cries

Well, this is not
helping me get hard.

Cries

Sighs It's like
when a plane goes down.

- What do they call that?
- Shitty?

No, it's never just
one thing that causes it.

It's a chain reaction.

Cascading failures.
That's what this feels like.

Losing my job, losing the kids,

dealing with Frank.

Sighs

Someone recently told me
to stop whining

and feeling sorry for myself.

Chuckles
She sounds like a bitch.

Well, she has her moments.

Legally and morally there are
acceptable methods of punishment

for children,
versus unacceptable methods.

Uh, I'm sorry.

Just hypothetically, if one's
teenage daughter gave birth

to a baby with Downs Syndrome
and then took off,

relieving her
of all responsibility,

if and when
she should come back,

would you recommend grounding?

Or in that instance would
a firm spanking be more...

You know, before
we take any more questions,

let's just go over some
of the basic...

- Would you give me a Valium?
- No, I only have one.

And it's my safety net in case
my hypnotherapy doesn't work.

Hypnotherapy is just paying
to nap in someone's office.

Give me a pill.

It's gonna show up
in your urine test.

- Give me the goddamn pill.
- What's the matter with you?

What this does is it
puts the responsibility

- right on the child.
- Okay. Come on.

Your job as parents
is to define the rules...

- Here. Christ.
- And then lay out

the consequences
that will follow

when those rules are broken.

Now the child breaking the rules
is then responsible

for his or her
own consequences.

And this method actually
leads to empowerment

and helps him or her feel more
in control of their own lives.

How is she still ovulating?
What is she, part bovine?

- Shh. Focus on me.
- Mm.

Yeah, now you're gonna pretend
like you're in high school

and you're gonna come quickly
like a rabbit, okay?

- Ooh, yeah.
- No, not that quick.

Mama, get in here!

Mm.

Grunts

- No. Not there, honey, no.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

You gotta shoehorn
or something?

Can you not talk, please?
Just don't say a word.

Cries

Are you crying?
Oh, God, she's crying.

Please don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry, mama.
Hey, hey, hey.

Okay! That's it!

We're gonna do this shit
and we're gonna be done with it.

Kev, get that dick hard.

Mama, wipe your
tears and focus!

We need to give those little
spermies someplace happy

to swim to.

Lay down!

Groans

Mm.

- Mama, get on it.
- Mm.

Mm. Mm!

Muffled groaning

- Aah!
- Mm.

Uh-huh.

Ooh!

Mm! Mm! Mm!

All passionately moaning

Hi.

I'm Monica.
What's your name?

Frank, wasn't the last time
I had to pee in a cup

when I was pregnant with Liam?

Remember that?
It was just like yesterday, huh?

Oh.

Uh, sorry, the shower
ran out of hot water.

Mama, you want Kevin
to take you home?

Well, he can't drive
with that leg.

No, but he can get
you home in a taxi.

It's the least we can do.

Well, let me get my bag.

Knock at door

- Hey, Carol.
- Hey, Fiona.

- Any work at the salon?
- Uh, not right now, baby.

- But I'll keep you in mind.
- Thanks.

Door closes

What was she doing here
so early?

She slept over
after she and Kevin had sex.

What?

Mama's the best surrogate
we got.

Turkey baster didn't work

so we had to do it
the old-fashioned way.

Jesus, V, I'm so wrapped up
in my own pity party,

I had no idea what kind
of biblical shit

you had going on here.

You okay?

If it works, I'll be fine.

How's Frank doing in rehab?

So far he seems
to be holding it together.

Heading over to DFS now
to make sure

he got all the paperwork in.

What's with all the asparagus?

You know how popeye
gets all big and strong

when he eats his spinach?

Mm-hm.

That's what asparagus
does for sperm.

Hm.

- You again.
- Me again.

Just wanted to make sure
Frank showed up

and all our paperwork
was good to go.

He did. He passed his
urine test with flying colors.

And yes, your paperwork
is all set.

So now we just wait
for a hearing?

Yeah.

You've done good, Fiona.
You are a great sister.

And those kids
are lucky to have you.

How did we show up
on DFS radar?

It was an anonymous
phone call, actually.

Chuckles
I bet it was that bitch

we turned away from daycare
'cause her kid stunk.

Um, no.

- It was a man, actually.
- A man?

It's never a man.
Men don't give a shit.

How is it fair that someone
can make one call

and completely ruin our lives,
and they get to be anonymous?

I have to go to the restroom.

I'd appreciate it
if you didn't click on this file

while I'm gone.

Frank: Yes, hello,
I would like to report

a negligent situation.

2119 North Wallace.

Gallagher.

Female:
And what's the situation?

Frank: Six kids living
in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.
Not that they don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, vile--

Female: - Excuse me, sir.
Frank: - What?

Female: Could you give me
your name, please?

Frank: No.
If it's all right,

I would like
to remain anonymous.

Female: Thank you for bringing
this to our attention.

Frank: No. Thank you.
And God bless you.

 Don't believe the lies

 your echoing heartbeat,
echoing heartbeat

 keeps our time


Don't know where the fuck
you were last week,

but here's what you
missed on Shameless.

They're digging out
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones,
the police show up.

You buried a body and you stole
from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

"My dad is gay
for your brother" thing,

it's, like, on film loop
in my brain.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

We are literally
digging up a body.

Walk away.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

I need to know the truth.
Can I have a damn baby or not?

What about a surrogate?

You two take it from me
when it comes out.

Yes, mama.

It will be our child.
It will be your grandchild.

You know the guy
you beat the shit out of?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion

and take all of his crap.

Don't know what you see
in that geriatric viagroid.

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

I can take care of you at home.

No, you can't.

Get in the car.
Debbie, get in the car.

I love you, Debbie!

Operator, can you connect me
with Child Welfare Services?

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturgess
from Child Protective Services.

it's not for naught

 You were beaming

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

they're not for naught

 You were willing

Train horn blaring

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, what the hell's going on?

Department of Family Services
is taking us away.

They what?
Can they do that?

It won't last, Debs.
I promise.

What was it last time?
A week?

Nine days.

Aw, 20 bucks says
we're back in five.

Can I get their placement
addresses from you now?

Not until the intake interviews
with the children are complete.

Who reported us?

Engine starting

Come on! Who was it?

Sighs

Frank.

Footsteps approaching

Frank. Frank.

Frank.

I'm off to my
hypnotherapy appointment.

I need you to watch Hiram.

I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Sheils.

Where's Jody?

He's working
at the tattoo parlor.

Marking idiots with ink so the
rest of us can recognize them.

Frank, you have tattoos.

Point well taken.

So-- and if you're
doing laundry,

can you put some
of Hymie's onesie's in?

Might as well.
You're both covered in pee-pee.

Hushed laughter

Shushes

There you go, buddy.

I just want you to know that

my dumping you
and leaving town...

is in no way a reflection of my
feelings toward you, Hiram.

I just gotta lay low
a little bit

in case they find Ginger's body
in my backyard.

Exhales

Sighs

Plates clattering

Oh, shit!
I got a shift in ten minutes.

Yeah, go to your shift.
I'll take care of this.

I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

Yeah.
I wasn't either.

I'm gonna see if I can get
one of the evil cock gobblers

to cover my shift
so I can get over to the DFS

and start tracking down
the kids.

You guys okay?

Oh, yeah.

Ain't our first time
at the rodeo.

'Cause Liam's still cute
and little...

Babbling

He'll go to some loving home
with people

who really want a family,
but waited so long

their egg batter rotted so they
can't have one of their own.

And Debbie can Carl will
be placed together because...

Because the State always tries
to keep siblings together.

And Lip and I can handle
whatever foster nut jobs

we end up with.

Remember that last guy
with the, uh...

was it the fucking
bathroom peephole?

Oh, yeah.

Well, this time's gonna
be a little different.

I've placed Liam
and Carl together,

but Debbie unfortunately
has to be placed separately.

All by myself?

And, Philip and Ian,
you're too old to be placed,

so you're going
to a group home.

Like a whore's period.
Late again, bitch.

You're wasting
your talents, Patty.

You should be tweeting
this crap.

Knocks on door

You're late.

I know. I'm sorry.

Look, I kind of have
a family emergency

and was wondering if I could
skip my shift today?

Would you look at this?
It's filthy.

My back is filthy.
'Cause you haven't washed it.

So why should I wash yours?

Look, I just need
a couple hours

to get to the Department
of Family Services.

They yanked my brothers
and sister from our house

this morning, and I just gotta

find out where they are
and make sure they're safe

and not with any psychos
or anything, please.

Sorry, but if you can't get
anyone to cover your shift...

You know as well as I do
none of these bitches

are gonna cover for me.

I still have that video
of you and I have no problem

sending it to your wife.

Yeah, and I have no problem
going to DFS to tell them

you steal from the register
and show up high every day.

Your word against mine.

Actually, the girls
will back me up.

And I'm gonna want you to quit

so I don't have to
pay you unemployment.

Fuck you, Bobby.

Tell you what, you, uh,
tickle the balls a little bit

and maybe I'll write you
a letter of recommendation.

It really puts the "home"
in "group home."

Baby babbling

Dog barking in distance

It's only gonna
be a couple days, okay?

Every Gallagher
can handle that, right?

- I'll take care of Liam.
- Yes, you will.

Hey, Debs.

See you soon, all right?

Hey.

Good day, gentlemen.

My name is d'Andre
and this is Gunderson House,

a Level 14 boys group home
housing underage D&Ds

in the Chicago system.

Is that "Dungeons and Dragons"?

"Delinquents and deviants."
Follow me.

This will be your primary
residence until we figure out

which one you are.

Your wallets and cell phones
will be in my care

until you've proven to me
that you can follow the rules.

- So it's like prison?
- It's up to you.

You will be given an opportunity
to earn back your money

and your cell phone privileges.

Gee, thanks.

You would do well
to shut your mouth

and keep your eyes open
in here.

Clears throat

The county database says that
you're available for placement,

but I'm concerned there are
too many children in your care.

I'm sure there's
some kind of limit.

Kids talking indistinctly

These ain't cats, honey.
They're kids.

They need someone
to take care of them.

That's why the Good Lord
put me here.

So I can take in all his babies
don't nobody else want.

Laughs

Come here, sweetheart.

Come on,
I'm not gonna bite you.

Laughs

You're a blessing.

Mama Kamala
is truly blessed to have you.

Yup.

It's only for a few days.
I'll be okay.

Um, this is my number.

If you have any questions
or, you know, if you just

want to talk about anything,
you can call me any time, okay?

Okey-dokey.

Bye-bye, now.

Rule number one.

No sitting on
the good furniture.

This is the good furniture?

Rule number two.
No sassing. You hear me?

Let me look inside that bag.
Give me that bag.

Make sure you ain't got nothing
in there to get you in trouble.

Why are you standing there
eyeballing me?

Get busy minding them kids.

Hi.
I'm Debbie.

Laronda.

You ain't getting
your bags back.

I know.

And what's your name?

We want to be completely
honest with you, Carl.

We have been looking
to adopt a bi-racial baby

for quite some time.

And when they called about Liam,
we were over the moon.

And then the State
told us about you.

And we want to try
to keep you two together.

So let's give
this foursome a try.

Which one are you again?

I'm Cassius and this is Lanier.

So you guys are gay?

- Yup.
- Yes.

Does, like, shit ever get
stuck on the tip of your dick?

Yeah.

Uh...

Gallagher?

I was hoping to see Marilyn.

She's been our caseworker
the last couple of years.

Well, the turnover rate
in our field is quite high.

It's really a wonder Marilyn
lasted as long as she did.

So how can I help you?

You can give me the addresses
where the kids were placed.

I already told you,
I can't give out any information

about the case until
the intakes are complete.

Come on. Marilyn always
used to give me the info,

just so I can know
they're okay,

and can get them stuff,
like books or clothes,

or whatever.

Well, that is a clear
violation of policy

on Marilyn's part.

Hey. I know
you think you're helping,

but as someone who
has been in and out

of the system their whole life,

I can tell you
it's a nightmare.

These kids have a big sister
who loves them,

and I just want
to make sure they're okay.

So give me something, Britney.

I mean, break a goddamn rule.

I can tell you
that I placed two together

in one foster home,
and the girl in another.

And the two older boys
are in a group home.

The one on Hester?

No. They're in
a Level 14 on Richmond.

Thanks.

Hey, if I can find one family
willing to take in all the kids,

could they be placed together?

In theory, yes.

- Stella been in yet?
- What's with the bag?

Uh, going fishing
for a couple of days.

I heard Stella's
pulling a long haul

up to northern Canada.

Hoping to hitch a ride.

Fishing? You gonna use
your tiny dick as a worm?

I've caught some big whales
with this little worm,

yourself included there, Moby.

Hello, Stella.
How are you, sunshine?

- What the hell do you want?
- Oh, you know, same as you.

Free pussy
and a life on the road.

- Could I hitch a ride?
- Where you headed?

Anywhere but here.

- Kill somebody?
- No, no, no.

But I did bury her.

Could always use some company.

I'll meet you here
tomorrow morning

before I pick up my load.

A couple of boilermakers
to take the edge off

the long haul, huh?

I don't drink before I drive.

I end up ramming
smart cars in the ass

just for shits and giggles.

Next week I bleach my exit ramp.

DFS took the kids this morning.

Oh, shit.

You think you and Kevin could
talk to your foster caseworker

about taking them in?

- Five Gallaghers in my house?
- Just for a couple days.

A week, maximum.

Lip and Ian got placed
in a Level 14 group home.

Level 14?

For kids that light
their parents on fire,

or stab them in the face while
they're napping on the couch.

Well, you're over 21 now.

Can't they just
release them to you?

I'd have to file
for guardianship.

Groans Five Gallaghers.

I'm gonna be the lone black dot
on a map of Ireland.

Hip-hop music playing



You been
in a group home before?

It's always like this?

No, last place I was in
was an actual home.

This is more like
a fucking labor camp.

Yo, give me your cash.

- What?
- Give me your cash.

Now. Come on.

Hey, Salvador, check it out.

It's that chick
from the movie Brave.

- He your boyfriend?
- No. Brother.

I'm Lip.
This is Ian.

We don't want any trouble,
all right?

We're just passing through.

Long as you show respect,
you're gonna be fine.

You're like
a fucking cockroach.

Able to live anywhere

Door opens

- Jimmy?
- Darker.

- Hey. Talk to your caseworker?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

Two reasons why we can't
take in your brood.

One. The fact
that you had a foster child

in your home that ran away
under your "supervision."

Two. Technically, the
investigation's still pending

as to the quality of your care.

The quality of my care?

You're saying her running away
is my fault?

Oh, you know what?

Do not get all up in my grill,
sister girl, okay?

Well, it was worth a shot.

Now what?

Gotta kick it into high gear.

Figure out where
the kids are staying.

Get the house ready
for home inspection.

They're gonna require a fit
parent to get the kids back,

so I'm hoping to find Monica

so I don't have to deal
with Frank.

Why does it always
come down to Frank?

Sighs

Carl, it's dinner time.

Carl?

Where is that boy?

Oh, I'm gonna
pound your fucking hole.

Yeah. Oh, that fucker's
going up your ass.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Why don't you
get those pants off

so I can eat your fucking hole?

Why do they
all have moustaches?

Out. Now.

That was an invasion of our
privacy and we won't have it.

You are not to touch things
that don't belong to you.

Now sit down.

Am I allowed
to touch the chair?

Don't be smart.

- What the hell is this?
- Kale, brown rice, and tofu.

Your body is a temple, Carl,

and you only want to put
things in it that are natural.

Like fists?

I saw it in that movie.

Yeah.
Yeah, it's been a while.

Yeah, I was just wondering
if you by any chance...

maybe know where
my mom might be?

Your daughter.

Monica.

Yup.
Yeah, I figured.

But I just thought I'd try.

Okay. Thanks.

Sighs

Now what?

With no Monica,
I kind of have no choice.

I gotta find Frank.

Get him sober and ready
to appear in court.

Chuckles

He's like
my sad-ass Obi Wan Kenobi.

I can help you with that.

That's a pretty
nice offer considering

how much of a dick
I was to you about your dad.

No, you're always a dick.

Seriously, I don't mean
to be an asshole.

It's just... genetic.

Yeah. You're not wrong.

I need to suck it up
about my dad being gay...

and a liar.

And I need to get over it.
And I am.

I'm good.

Silver lining?

Huh?

Finally have the house
to ourselves.

I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling it.

You mind if we just lay here?

Yeah.
Yeah, sounds nice.

What is this stuff?

It's pus from
your mother's monkey.

Thought you liked
the taste of that.

What's your problem, dude?

Nick, Salvador,
find another table.

Come on, chop-chop.

Proof of your employment
came through,

so you go to work today.

I need your employer
to sign this, times in and out.

Understand?

You know, I'm actually
pretty excited to get out there.

- Start looking for work.
- Nice try.

You have court-mandated
community service hours you owe.

Yeah, but only a few.

Then I can get out there
and start looking for work,

so I can become
a contributing member

of our great,
capitalistic society.

You think you're better
than everyone here, don't you?

Oh, that's--
that's rhetorical, right?

I mean, you don't actually
want me to answer that, do you?

Cute. See, I could
smack you across the face.

But I think it's better
I get out of your way.

Let life bend you over instead.

Dude thinks he's in
an episode ofScared Straight.

Ethel really
fucked up our kid credit.

Yup.

Now we can't even
get a foster kid?

- Anybody can get a foster kid.
- I think it's a sign.

Jerry Sandusky could
probably get a foster kid.

It's a sign
we need to step it up

in the surrogate department.

Look, we just did
the baster thing with your mom.

Let's just see if it works.

Mama always pukes the morning
after she gets knocked up.

As a kid, it was like watching
someone take ipecac,

you could set your watch by it.

My super "spermazoa"
too much for her?

Spermatozoa.
I don't think it worked.

We need to try something else.

Frank?

God damn it, did you
sleep here last night?

Guilty.

Stella here yet?

Oh, come on.
I'm not helping you up.

Get up.

As of right now,
you are officially on the wagon.

DFS made a surprise appearance
and the kids got pulled.

It's time for your
father-of-the-year act.

Oh, my God.
Are they all right?

I'll tell you what.

Let's meet back at the house
and we'll get this all settled.

Looks heavy.

Why don't I carry this
back to the house for you?

But I need it for some errands
I'm going to run a little--

Back at the house now,

or you'll lose your kids
and the welfare checks

that come with them.

I go to the house,
the city finds Ginger's body.

I'm toast.

I found Ginger
and I tossed her bones.

You're safe.

Oh. That's great.

Not for you.

You don't do exactly as I say,
and I'll rat you out

about Aunt Ginger's checks
and your fake disability.

- You don't have the balls.
- Jesus Christ!

I need you to do this!
Can you just do this?

I'm sorry.
Did you just say you need me?

Yes! I need you
to get your shit together

and get the kids back.

Well, seeing as how
you need something from me,

maybe I need something
from you.

For starters,
I would like to be shown

the respect which I deserve.

I believe
I'm already doing that.

And this one
is non-negotiable.

I want free roam
of my own house.

Fine.

We're gonna go visit Lip
and Ian in the group home.

God knows what they've been
dealing with in that shithole.

And then we go
find your lawyer.

He has a lawyer?

Don't worry, Liam.

Soon as I steal
enough stuff from these guys,

we're outta here.

Rock music playing in car

I spent some time here.

That summer mom was sent away
for knifing a poodle.

- Hey! I missed you guys.
- Oh, yeah!

- How you holding up?
- Aw, we're fine.

The place is a joke.

They still serving
that rotten porridge?

He already on the wagon?

Oh, why do you
have to say that?

As of right now.
You out on furlough?

No, I've gotta work.
He's gotta finish parole hours.

You guys want a lift?

No, we gotta get our bus
passes signed by the driver.

- You find Debs and the boys?
- Not yet, but I will.

Do you need anything?
You need cash? Clothes?

No, no. Look, don't
worry about us, we're fine.

Worry about him.

Where's my hug?

Laughs

I'll wash, you dry.

Sneezes

Grab a cup of kool-aid
from the table.

Hey, strawberry shortcake!

Get on in here
and cut my toenails!

Groans

Okay, um, take over.

Come on, come on.

I mean, there's
just no privacy.

If I wanna jack-off,
I gotta do it in the bathroom.

Can't even begin to imagine
what a pussy you'd be in juvie.

Laughs

You fuck anyone in there yet?

God, no.

Wise choice.

Even if you're propositioned,
it's probably just a setup.

Guys want to find out
if you're gay

and pound the shit outta you.

And not in a good way.

Great.

Hey, my dad took my brothers
on a run out of town

for a couple days,
so you wanna ditch that dump

and crash at my place, you can.

Was I just invited
to a sleepover?

Fuck you,
is what you were invited to.

Laughs

Fiona here?
She's not home.

Are you okay?

Did you foster parents hurt you?
'Cause I will--

- No. We ran away.
- Honey, you can't stay here.

The police will
come looking for you.

We're with these
two gay robot guys

and they keeping talking about
how they want to swipe Liam.

Honey, you gotta go back.

I know what it's like to have
a foster kid run away on me.

Come on, I'll take you.

What if they really
want to keep Liam?

The only reason why
they would want to keep him

is if they want him,
so be sure that they don't.

Be creative.

Can you at least
hold some of my stuff?

What stuff?

Clattering

Jesus, Lou!
Laughs When did that happen?

- It's not mine.
- Get to the point, Frank.

Who's this?

My daughter and her girlfriend.

- Who's in trouble?
- DFS snatched my kids.

- I need you to get them back.
- Catch?

I have no money and no promise
of any coming my way

any time soon.

Okay.

First order of business,
you need to get your ass to DFS.

You need to file a petition
to reinstate custody

and you're gonna need to dig up

that useless wife
of yours, Monica.

It's always better
to have signatures

from two shitty parents
instead of one.

What if we can't find her?

Well, find someone
that looks like her.

And you're gonna need her
to take parenting classes.

And I'm gonna go ahead
and get the case filed.

And then I'll see you
at the hearing.

In the meantime,
no drugs, no booze.

No poppy seed bagels.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

Thanks for the phone call.

You know how hard it is
to find a public phone?

Ian managed.

Then I had to track your ass
down through the city.

Sorry, I've been busy.

Molly's mom showed up
at my house.

- Oh, she's still alive?
- Turns out Molly's a runner.

What, you just
let her take her?

Oh, I was supposed to stop her?

I don't know,
if she ran it was probably

for a good reason, no?

Or not. I used to run away
all the time when I was little.

My point exactly.

My dad's out of town
for a few days

and I told Mickey
he could have the place.

Can I stay with you?

I got to play it straight
in this group home for a bit.

Maybe I can sneak you in
tonight though.

Promise I won't get gang raped?

Nope.

Whatever, I'm in.

Why are you eating candy
before dinner?

'Cause it says here that dark
chocolate has an amino acid

that doubles your sperm count.

I didn't read that one,
but mama says

asparagus and garlic
does the trick, so tah-dah.

If I eat all that, my piss
is gonna stink for a month.

And mama's
bringing over oysters.

But we gotta think
of a better delivery system

than the turkey baster.

Squirt gun.

Kind of messy.

What about a straw?
Silly straw?

- Jacobs.
- Here.

And Weston.

Weston!

Here.

All right, good night,
you shits of Chicago!

Pricks of Illinois!

Have fun.

How did you get
the private room?

I made some friends.

Is this what it's gonna be like

when you sneak me
into your dorm in college?

A little different.

I'm guessing my dorm mates
would be literate.

You are out of your mind.

Have you seen
that fucking ponytail?

It's a powerful ponytail, man.
That's bullshit.

Segal could totally
kick Van Damme's ass.

Oh, unless-- unless...

It's Double Impact Van Damme.

'Cause that's some
Van double Damme!

Laughs

I wanna fuck Van Damme.

Both: Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Kev is just gonna lie down
with you for procreation,

not sex.

- What is the difference?
- It's clinical.

So no one enjoys it.

Millions of sperm died
in that turkey baster.

This will deliver
the biggest batch.

The bigger the batch,
the better the chance.

Uh-uh. No, honey.

This is an express bus

Chuckles

I want nothing more than
to be able to give you the baby

that I know you want.

And the grandbaby
that you deserve.

But I can't.
And it kills me.

Please, just give it a go
while you're still ovulating.

and how much?

- No! Frank, no!
- Wait.

You-- first of all,
get out! Get out!

- Just hear me out.
- You are not allowed in here.

- Get out!
- DFS pinched my kids.

I need you to pretend to be
Monica to help me get them back.

What? No! No! Why should I
do anything for you?

- You left Hiram all alone.
- I am begging you.

As someone who knows what
it feels like to lose a kid.

Karen ran away.

Can you imagine what
it must feel like to have them

taken from you?

This isn't for Frank, okay?

It's for Debbie
and Carl and Liam.

Maybe you should do it,
Shelly-bear... for the kids.

Sighs

Exhales

Grunts Give it up, Kev.

You can't make it
dark enough to deny

what's about to happen in here.

I wish I was drunk as you.

No, I can't risk
the whiskey-dick.

Okay, let's get this going.

Laughs

Shh!
Knock it off, mama!

Hey, wait, wait, wait.
What's with the KKK costume?

I saw them use
something like this

at that super jewey wedding
I went to last year.

It keeps the skin from touching.
Acts as a barrier.

I feel like a ghost prostitute.

You know, like that
Jennifer Love Hewitt show.

You seen that?

You know, where she's,
like, a call girl for ghosts

or some shit.

No, that--
it's two different shows.

- All right, you two ready?
- Yeah.

No! Let me get
the hell out of here first.

I can't watch this part.

You-- you okay out there?

- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
- You need any help?

No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

Ooh. Why she didn't
cut me a mouth hole?

How am I supposed to--
whoa! Hello! Ooh!

Looks like I got
a visitor down there!

- Ooh!
- God damn it.

Whoops!
Ding dong ditch.

Somebody rang my bell
and ran away.

I feel like I'm fucking Casper.

Hey, you know,
it's getting seriously hard

to breathe under here.

- Can I take this off my face?
- No! No!

Can you dump Frank at DFS?

I gotta drop some stuff off
for Carl.

Yeah, not a problem.

Let's go, Frank!

Been a while
since I've been in.

Maybe I need a new picture.

We had a bad meth run last year

and you know what
that stuff can do to you.

They've got a website
and everything.

Well, now that you've
filed your petition

to reinstate custody,
we'll need you to sign up

for parenting classes.

- Parenting classes?
- Good.

Also there may be
some random drug tests

and we'll need to set up
a home visit prior

to the possible
release of the children.

So I will get
the class registration.

I'll be right back.

Fucking big brother.

I don't want any goddamn
parenting classes.

What are they?

You sit in a room
and they lecture you

how to be Ozzie and Harriet.

I was thinking
maybe I could figure out

where I went wrong with Karen.

Kids come pre-wired,

it has nothing to do
with your parenting.

I pretty much like
being a blonde.

I feel like cotton candy.

Hi.

Uh, my name's Fiona Gallagher.
I'm here to visit Debbie.

Is she here?

- Are you her mother?
- Sister.

I just want to say hi.
May I see her?

I just want to talk to her!

Hey.

Do all your talking out here.

I'm gonna need her back
in 15 for chores.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Are there a million kids
in there?

Just a few,
but they're really nice.

And Kamala's not so bad.

Bed's pretty comfortable
and there's hot water.

Sighs

I brought you some books
and clothes.

- Do you need any money?
- Nope. I'm good.

Zipper

When do you think
we can go back home?

Soon.
Real soon.

I brought you some
Hershey's Kisses too.

These were like gold when
I was in my first foster home.

Thanks.

Hey, I got your brother's
working papers for today.

Oh, great.
I'll give them to him. Thanks.

Hey!

Wow, you look so clean.

Yeah, they make us

And they have this weird toilet
that cleans your bits.

A "bidet."

Laughs
Sometimes in the summer

we use a whacky lawn
sprinkler for that, but...

We gotta watch
those spinning arms.

Please, come.
Have a seat.

It's nice to see that the boys
have someone who loves them.

We're glad you came.

But just to make it clear,
we have filed the paperwork

to adopt Liam.

And we're seriously
considering adopting Carl too.

But please know that we'd
love for you to stay in contact

and visit as often
as you'd like.

We think it's important
for the boys to know

where they come from.

Why is my seat wet?

Oh, no, Liam. Did you
pee on the couch again?

Was that you?
And the wall too?

Liam, that is a matte finish!

How the hell are we
gonna get that out?

It's just paint, honey.
I can touch it up.

Now which color is that now?
Summer shadow?

He's just a baby.
He didn't mean it.

Babies are just so messy.

Baby babbling
Did you do that?

- Did you do that?
- A boat.

All right, I gotta get to work.

All right, just--
in a minute, okay?

Wanna do the honors?

- Is that a rosary for giants?
- No.

- Huh?
- No.

No, man, they're Ben Wa beads.

- Ow!
- Come on, you piece of shit!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

No, it's never just
one thing that causes it.

It's a chain reaction.

Cascading failures.

dealing with Frank.

Someone recently told me
to stop whining

and feeling sorry for myself.

Chuckles
She sounds like a bitch.

Well, she has her moments.

Legally and morally there are
acceptable methods of punishment

for children,
versus unacceptable methods.

Uh, I'm sorry.

Just hypothetically, if one's
teenage daughter gave birth

to a baby with Downs Syndrome
and then took off,

relieving her
of all responsibility,

if and when
she should come back,

would you recommend grounding?

Or in that instance would
a firm spanking be more...

You know, before
we take any more questions,

let's just go over some
of the basic...

- Would you give me a Valium?
- No, I only have one.

And it's my safety net in case
my hypnotherapy doesn't work.

Hypnotherapy is just paying
to nap in someone's office.

Give me a pill.

It's gonna show up
in your urine test.

- Give me the goddamn pill.
- What's the matter with you?

What this does is it
puts the responsibility

- right on the child.
- Okay. Come on.

Your job as parents
is to define the rules...

- Here. Christ.
- And then lay out

the consequences
that will follow

when those rules are broken.

Now the child breaking the rules
is then responsible

for his or her
own consequences.

And this method actually
leads to empowerment

and helps him or her feel more
in control of their own lives.

How is she still ovulating?
What is she, part bovine?

- Shh. Focus on me.
- Mm.

Yeah, now you're gonna pretend
like you're in high school

and you're gonna come quickly
like a rabbit, okay?

- Ooh, yeah.
- No, not that quick.

Mama, get in here!

Mm.

Grunts

- No. Not there, honey, no.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

You gotta shoehorn
or something?

Can you not talk, please?
Just don't say a word.

Cries

Are you crying?
Oh, God, she's crying.

Please don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry, mama.
Hey, hey, hey.

Okay! That's it!

We're gonna do this shit
and we're gonna be done with it.

Kev, get that dick hard.

Mama, wipe your
tears and focus!

We need to give those little
spermies someplace happy

to swim to.

Lay down!

Groans

Mm.

- Mama, get on it.
- Mm.

Mm. Mm!

Muffled groaning

- Aah!
- Mm.

Uh-huh.

Ooh!

Mm! Mm! Mm!

All passionately moaning

Hi.

I'm Monica.
What's your name?

Frank, wasn't the last time
I had to pee in a cup

when I was pregnant with Liam?

Remember that?
It was just like yesterday, huh?

Oh.

Uh, sorry, the shower
ran out of hot water.

Mama, you want Kevin
to take you home?

Well, he can't drive
with that leg.

No, but he can get
you home in a taxi.

It's the least we can do.

Well, let me get my bag.

Knock at door

- Hey, Carol.
- Hey, Fiona.

- Any work at the salon?
- Uh, not right now, baby.

- But I'll keep you in mind.
- Thanks.

Door closes

What was she doing here
so early?

She slept over
after she and Kevin had sex.

What?

Mama's the best surrogate
we got.

Turkey baster didn't work

so we had to do it
the old-fashioned way.

Jesus, V, I'm so wrapped up
in my own pity party,

I had no idea what kind
of biblical shit

you had going on here.

You okay?

If it works, I'll be fine.

How's Frank doing in rehab?

So far he seems
to be holding it together.

Heading over to DFS now
to make sure

he got all the paperwork in.

What's with all the asparagus?

You know how popeye
gets all big and strong

when he eats his spinach?

Mm-hm.

That's what asparagus
does for sperm.

Hm.

- You again.
- Me again.

Just wanted to make sure
Frank showed up

and all our paperwork
was good to go.

He did. He passed his
urine test with flying colors.

And yes, your paperwork
is all set.

So now we just wait
for a hearing?

Yeah.

You've done good, Fiona.
You are a great sister.

And those kids
are lucky to have you.

How did we show up
on DFS radar?

It was an anonymous
phone call, actually.

Chuckles
I bet it was that bitch

we turned away from daycare
'cause her kid stunk.

Um, no.

- It was a man, actually.
- A man?

It's never a man.
Men don't give a shit.

How is it fair that someone
can make one call

and completely ruin our lives,
and they get to be anonymous?

I have to go to the restroom.

I'd appreciate it
if you didn't click on this file

while I'm gone.

Frank: Yes, hello,
I would like to report

a negligent situation.

2119 North Wallace.

Gallagher.

Female:
And what's the situation?

Frank: Six kids living
in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.
Not that they don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, vile--

Female: - Excuse me, sir.
Frank: - What?

Female: Could you give me
your name, please?

Frank: No.
If it's all right,

I would like
to remain anonymous.

Female: Thank you for bringing
this to our attention.

Frank: No. Thank you.
And God bless you.

Hannah Cartwright & Ross Tones




 Don't believe the lies

 your echoing heartbeat,
echoing heartbeat

 keeps our time


Here's what you missed
on Shameless last time.

Not too much. It
was kind of light last week.

Jesus Christ!
I need you to do this!

I need you to get your shit
together and get the kids back.

No drugs, no booze.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

That's why the good lord
put me here--

so I can take in all his babies

don't nobody else want.

Rule number one. No sitting
on the good furniture.

We have filed the paperwork
to adopt Liam.

Oh, no, Liam.

Did you pee on the couch again
and the wall too?

How the hell are we gonna get that out?

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

It's me or the baby.

What is that for?

Sex swing.

Oh, God.

It's good for us to grow.

No!

No, we're just taking fake
wedding pictures for the I.N.S.

I hate this I.N.S. bullshit.

Aw, shit.

What the fuck?

Get the fuck up!
Both groaning

No son of mine is gonna be
a goddamn AIDS monkey.

Who reported us?

I would like to report
a negligence situation.

Six kids living in squalor,
no parental supervision.

If it's all right, I would like
to remain anonymous.

High Strung's The Luck You Got

 Think of all the luck you got

 know that it's not for naught

 you were beaming once before

 but it's not like that anymore

 what is this downside

 that you speak of?

 what is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

 round up the friends you got

 know that they're not for naught

 you were willing once before

 but it's not like that anymore

 what is this downside

 that you speak of?

 what is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

- Get the locks?
- Hardware store isn't open.

Did you knock?
Manny sleeps upstairs.

- I'll get it.
- Let's go.

Deadbolts, front and back.
Frank's not allowed in anymore.

- You gonna rip him a new one?
- We're done with him.

Let's go. Come on.
Don't want to be late.

You sure about this?

Opera music playing

What the hell?
TV's broken.

Uh, parental controls.

We wouldn't want you stumbling
onto something you shouldn't.

That's the only reason to watch.

It still gets Discovery Kids,
Disney, and Bravo.

Come on. Put the remote down.
It's time for your bath.

How many damn times do I have to smell

like mango and pomegranate?

Uh, if you think I'm gonna let
you near your tutor without one,

you got another thing coming, young man.

- Tutor?
- To brush up on your math.

- You're two grade levels behind.
- Only two?

- Daddy!
- I missed you, baby.

They finally let Maria's dad
out of prison, huh?

He'll be back.
So will she.

Till then, drop the mop.
Come on.

You want me to do laundry first?

You're going to replace her.

Downstairs.

Downstairs?

You gonna make me push you down?

Rock music

Okay, all right,
find a seat and get busy.

Debbie, here!
Next to me.

You can share my Krazy Glue.

She forces us to make jewelry?

Oh, no. You don't have to.
Not if you aren't hungry.

One bracelet gets you a burger.
Four earrings, French fries.

Blows

I don't think this is legal.

Used to be only
a couple of us down here,

but business took off when Mama Kamala

started slapping those
"made in Africa" stickers on.

Dust gets my allergies going.

Yeah, well, the mold and
rat droppings can't be helping.

I'd take more, but it makes me sleepy.

Idle hands are the devil's work, hmm?

Last one.

If I had a dime for every time
I heard you say that,

I'd have exactly one dime.

Court hearing's tomorrow.

I thought you already pissed in a cup.

Spot test. Anything to keep
families apart. One more.

Amen, Frank. Gestapo tried
to declare me an unfit parent.

You brought a crack pipe
to the courthouse.

Who the hell tries to run a crack pipe

through a metal detector?

I know the dog and pony--
show up in a suit,

flash some AA chips,
character reference.

They'll hand the brats right over.

Well, it's nice to know
the bar is set so high.

Nothing more American
than a second chance.

Or a third or a fourth.

Redemption, tugs at the heartstrings.

- Shot for the road.
- Oh, you be careful, Frank.

Those child-stealing liberal
bastards are out for blood.

Broke my judicial cherry
years ago, Chester.

They will never take my kids from me.

I want the kids.

- Groans Your parents know?
- Not yet.

They'll relinquish their rights?

My dad's made a career
of refusing responsibility.

- Mom's M.I.A.
- What are my chances?

Cases I take are all about

whether a kid's gonna live
in Aspen or Monaco.

Well, my brother said you'd help.

I told Chip I'd give you five minutes.

- Please, Mr. Redel.
- You can't afford me.

- You do pro bono?
- As little as possible.

My brothers and sister
are in foster homes,

and my father is the reason why.

I need custody now
so I can get them home,

and you're not going anywhere
until you tell me how to do it.

Sighs

You know, the firm makes me do
one pro Bono case a year,

and I guess this won't be
as bad as representing

those scary motherfuckers
at the innocence project.

What do I have to do?

Get your parents
to terminate their rights

and prove you can provide
a stable environment.

Get W-2s to show
you've got a full-time job.

You got a place for the kids to live?

Uh-huh.

Hey, get your arm out of the door

so I can go bill somebody?

Thanks.

Baby's finally asleep.

Oh, no.

Should be able to
squeeze in a good 40 minutes

before he's back up.

Jody.

Babe, this is gonna blow your mind.

What if I don't want my mind blown?

All I'm gonna be thinking
about while you choke me out

is how much I love you.

Sweetheart, I can't hang you.

I hang myself.

I just need you to cut me down
when I pass out.

Knocking on door

Aah!

- Do not do this!
- No!

Take this down!
I gotta get that!

Gasping

Get down!

Yeah, that'll work.

Oh, hello.
Can I help you?

Show-- tell her.

Uh, I think you have my baby in there.

- Uh, we need it back.
- What?

You have an Asian baby in there.

Speaking Chinese Baby.

Uh, my mom wants it back.

Tell us your name.

Paula.

Alcoholic.

Applause
Welcome, Paula.

Keep coming back, Paula.

Keep coming back.
Keep coming back.

All right, would anyone
like a 30-day chip?

Right here.
Right here.

Let's skip the hug.
It's a little gay.

Bullshit!

30 days? Frank hasn't been
sober for 30 minutes.

Mind your own business.

I can smell the booze from here.

- Just give me the chip.
- Don't do it!

Just let me borrow it.

You've got to earn the chip
like we all did,

through blood, sweat, and tears.

Only requirement for membership

is the desire to stop drinking.

Exactly.

If I'm tempted by the bottle,

I can look to the chip
for encouragement.

Pay it forward, Nance.

This meeting is for people

who have changed their lives
for the better, Frank.

Come on.

Can't do it.

For the better?

You're all dying
a slow, miserable death,

thanks to this cult
of self-improvement.

Drop off the kids,
9:00 to 5:00, PTA, AA.

You call that a life?
This ain't North Korea.

- Alcohol is a gift.
- It's time to go!

Nance, what happened to you?

You used to dance on tables!

Now it's cleaning your dad's catheter

and the graveyard shift
at the drugstore!

You're young!
Don't pack it in!

All right.
All right, slow down.

- I need to make a will.
- What?

I could probably download one
from the Internet.

- All right. For who?
- Aunt Ginger.

I gotta finally make it official.

I'm getting the house.

And I need a W-2
to show I have a job.

It doesn't matter

if you can't get Monica
to sign away her rights.

I don't need her to sign.

I was forging doctor's notes
in first grade.

Hey.

Hey, I thought I heard the door.

They let you out of the group home?

Oh, yeah.
They cut us loose from dawn till dusk.

I found them.

I'm going to visit Carl and Liam.

He asked for M-80s,
Nintendo DS,

and ninja throwing stars.

- Could use your help.
- How?

I'm getting custody.

Of us?

It's the only way to bring everyone home

and keep it that way.

Timmy is the father!
The father gets the baby!

It's the law!

Tell them, you never
give up your rights!

Well, we got rights too, lady!

If we want to get rid
of a kid, we stay in China!

Crying

Show me the baby!

Don't you do it.

- She is his grandmother.
- So are you.

- Please.
- Okay, okay.

Crying

What's wrong?
You break him?

- He's got Down's Syndrome.
- We fix him.

- Fix him?
- Fix the baby.

Traditional Chinese medicine.

Special herbs from Guangxi
province. Good as new.

You can't fix Down's Syndrome.
It's an extra chromosome.

We have an herb for chromosome.

Have an herb for everything.
Chromosome goes away.

Isn't that right, beautiful boy?

- What's this?
- Nothing. It's for the dog.

Here. Sparky!
Whistles

Can I hold him?

Oh!

Where's the mother?
Father is here.

Baby needs a father.
We have a big family.

Many little cousins to play with.

What's taking so long?

You don't have to do this.

Custody.
It's a big responsibility.

Lip'll help.
And Ian.

It's permanent.

Exactly. Frank permanently
out of our lives.

Doing Kev's taxes
every year since I was ten

is finally gonna pay off.

You just gotta scan the W-2
and change the name.

Yeah, it's so easy,

it's like they're daring you
to commit fraud.

I don't want to get Kev in trouble.

- Yo, Kev?
- Hey, need a refill?

No. Is it cool if we put
Fiona's name on your W-2?

- Sure. What's a W-2?
- Hmm?

Look, even if he gets pinched, right?

The feds'll figure out pretty quickly

he can't do his own taxes,
let alone fake someone else's.

Anything else?

Yeah. I need you
to get a will notarized.

- A will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

Good news. She died.
We're getting the house.

Will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah. We're gonna
need a body, too.

Uh, where are you gonna get a dead body?

Ringtone

- Sorry to bail. It's my mom.
- Everything okay?

Uh, yeah, it's just divorce

plus copious amounts of chardonnay

equals expensive accidents.

I'll call you later, okay?

Bacardi, and leave the bottle.

Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

Estefania texted 911.
Immigration's at her house.

Told me they were coming tomorrow, man!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Open the door!

Aw, man, what the fuck are you watching?

Cartoons, man.

- Roadrunner is funny as shit.
- Jesus Christ.

Three bracelets and one necklace.

Enough for chicken rings.

- Just two?
- Two earrings.

- Four earrings.
- Two pairs.

Earrings come in pairs.

God helps those who help themselves.

You want 'em or not?

Can I use the bathroom?

Where do you think you're going?

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Tires squeal

Horn honks

Tires squealing

Horn honks

- Ah!
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

Wilton. Steve Wilton.
Estefania's husband. Hi.

Ah.
What are we doing?

Dog barking in distance

- Hey, need a favor.
- Uh-oh.

That's how I started the talk
with my mom.

I hope you're not asking me
to mount your man.

Those geriatrics at the nursing home

drop like flies, right?

Thought it would be,
"Wham, bam, thank you, mom,"

but Kev's sperm
were as gun-shy as he was.

Bought an ovulation calendar.
Have to track her damn cycle.

- You're going again?
- What choice do I have?

At least this way,
I'll know when she's fertile.

I don't want Kevin fucking
my mom any more than he has to.

So, you must lose

a couple of those seniors
at the home a week, right?

More when Bernice is working.

That negligent bitch is like
the grim fucking reaper. Why?

I need a body.
To get the kids back.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

Thanks.
Knew I could count on you.

Father Pete.
Just who I was looking for.

The silver's locked up, Frank.

Laughs

You always had a great
sense of humor, padre.

There's not enough laughs
in religion these days.

Too much fire and brimstone.

- It turns the kids off.
- Got a sermon to write.

While you're putting pen to paper,

how about dashing off
a letter for yours truly?

Kids got taken away again?

Superlatives appreciated.

I wrote you character
references the last two times,

and you're still a deadbeat.

I've turned over a new leaf.

You're the reason we had to
install security cameras.

- Close the door on your way out.
- So that's it?

You're turning away sinners
who are looking for forgiveness?

This-- this is why white kids
are flocking to Allah.

We are in a war for hearts and minds,

and you are shipping American youth

to terror camps in Pakistan.

This is what happens

when you put a German
in charge of the church.

You're not leaving, are you?

You could just reprint

the one you did last time.

Then you'll get the hell out?

Use parish letterhead.

And if he gets a diaper rash,
try the Desitin.

And, um, at night,
sing him Song Sung Blue.

- Song Sung...
- Yeah, he loves Neil Diamond.

I put the words in the diaper bag.

And tickle him.
Don't forget to tickle him.

He loves that,
especially under the armpit.

He laughs so hard.

Are you sure this is what you want?

He should know his dad.
Yeah.

This way, he'll get to be with everyone,

just like a timeshare.

Yeah.
I love you so much, Hymie.

Okay.

Come tomorrow.
Tickle him.

I will.

And we'll see you weekends and holidays.

Don't forget Neil Diamond!

Car door shuts Sweet Caroline...

Car starts

And Cracklin' Rosie get on board!

He loves Neil diamond.

Car door shuts

Sniffles

It's the right thing to do.

Can't see how.
I miss him already.

You want to go upstairs?

Babe?

I should get back to Fiona.

Immigration is getting suspicious.

Not my fault.

How much money do you have
in this account, exactly?

Gas bill.

You're going to be here now
mornings and nights, yes?

In case Immigration makes
another surprise visit?

Yeah, absolutely.
Wouldn't miss it.

- Other than tomorrow.
- Speaking foreign language

Uh, my girlfriend's trying
to adopt her siblings.

The court hearing's tomorrow.

You know, didn't even ask me.
Just assumed I'd be on board.

And why would she ask you?

It's not only her decision.
It affects me too.

You always take care of your family.

Yeah, well, I didn't exactly
sign up for that.

She is too good for you.
Cable.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big. Just some
"walking around" money.

Just a couple grand.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

My parents' money is
tied up in their divorce,

and I'm gonna need some cash

if I'm supporting a whole family now.

You always take care of your family.

You take care of them, not Nando.

There was an old lady
who lived in a shoe.

She's 22.

Had so many kids,
she didn't know what to do.

What difference does it make?
She's been doing the job for years.

- You cool with it?
- Whatever it takes. You?

As long as I don't have to
call her "mom."

- Oh, sh--
- Guess who?

Jimmy's dad?

Hey, you seen Mickey around?

He's been missing.
He owes me 50 bucks.

- He'll be on his feet soon.
- What happened?

- My dad pistol-whipped him.
- Why?

Since when does anyone need
a reason to pistol-whip Mickey?

- Have you signed up yet?
- What for?

S.A.T. The deadline's
tomorrow. I told you.

I'll do it online.
It takes two seconds.

Yeah, you said you'd graduate too,

and you're on your what,
fourth semester of senior year?

My third.
Only two courses left.

All right.
So, where are we going?

Uh, drew up a will.
We need it notarized.

- Ginger Gallagher?
- It's a long story.

Well, it looks like
you wrote down the wrong year.

Uh, no, that's the right year.

What, 2006?

You're taking the S.A.T.?

Not unless someone's paying me.

- Hey.
- You must be Sheila.

Yes?

Jody's told us so much about you.

- Oh.
- Hey.

Hi. Are you
friends of Jody's?

Oh, it was so good to get his call.

Hadn't heard from him in a while.

- Outlet?
- Um, it's around the corner.

- Where do you want the plastic?
- Plastic?

Yeah, the carpet looks nice.
Wouldn't want to ruin it.

Oh, um, let me-- Jody?

Did Jody hire you guys
to work on the house?

Yo, Shawn, this enough lube?

Made a Costco run.
Got another in the car.

Should last us for round one, right?

Jody!

What's up, fellas?
You stretch yet, old man?

Yeah, yeah. Where do you
want the Gatorade?

- Uh, the fridge is fine.
- Can I, um, talk to you?

- You meet the guys?
- Yeah, I-I did.

I'll be right back.
Ow. What's-- what's wrong?

- Get them out of here!
- Why?

- I thought you'd be into it.
- Are you nuts?

I figured it'd get your mind off stuff.

I was right to have Hymie
go with the Wongs!

What?

This is not a healthy
environment for a child.

You mean I'm the reason he's gone?

Clears throat

So is-- is this gonna
happen or what?

I gotta pick up my daughter
from ballet in an hour.

- No! It is not!
- Yes! Yes, it is!

- Somewhere else.
- Don't sweat it.

I got an eVite to a bukkake
party on the West Side.

Sweet. All right, guys.
Let's get out of here.

Jody?
Jody.

Dog barking in distance

Hey, thanks for getting the deadbolt.

- Hey.
- How's your mom?

- Just needed a little TLC.
- I need to find Frank.

- Oh, he's upstairs.
- You let him in?

No, he was already raiding
the fridge when I got here.

You seen my suit?

I'm gonna take the kids off your hands.

All you gotta do is sign a form.

Can't find anything
in this goddamn house.

Did you hear me?
I want the kids.

If you want a kid so bad,
toss your birth control pills.

I want you to give up
your parental rights.

I'm serious. Look.
I already got Monica to sign.

You'd have to find her first.

- Where is she?
- Not telling you.

She's my wife.

If she wanted you to know where she is,

she would have told you herself.

Now, you gonna sign the form?

- No!
- She did.

- She would never do that.
- I got a witness.

It's not like you want your kids anyway.

They're my kids!

You're the one who called DFS on 'em

to have them taken away!

- Bullshit!
- I heard the tape.

I never fucking called anybody.

Of course you don't remember.
You're drunk all the time.

Just tell me what it's gonna take.

What? Suddenly, you give
a shit about your kids?

You don't want to sign, fine.

I'll have you declared unfit.
I already got a lawyer.

- I'm getting the kids.
- You're not taking my kids!

It's Veronica. Says
she's got a dead body for you.

- All right.
- Hey, V.

Groans I'm hungry.

Make more earrings.
They're easier.

Gotta escape.
Get food.

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Could attack her with scissors.

That's like going after
a rhino with a butter knife.

Oh, you call that a cross?

Give me the damn Krazy Glue, Carley.

Give me your Benadryl.

Now, this is a cross Jesus
would be proud to be nailed to.

You want to play with this?
All right.

Hey, careful with those throwing stars.

They could pierce a jugular.

- You gotta get me out of here.
- Why?

They took my rifle,

they make me brush my teeth
after every meal,

they're always around,
seeing if I'm okay.

Do you mean they're
trying to be good parents?

Uh, don't forget, Carl.
Church in ten minutes.

Text alert

Shit.

That's Fiona.
I gotta go meet her.

But, hey, um, see if you can get

the security codes for this place.

We'll come back in a couple months

and steal a bunch of this shit,
all right?

Hang in there.

Come on, Mandy, we gotta go.

See you, buddy.

Bye.

Upbeat music



Gunshots

So, uh, thanks to me,

you've been pistol-whipped
and shot in the ass?

Gunshot

Just want to make sure you're okay.

Would you at least look at me?

Fine.

Hey, seen any of your boyfriend's

Sex Addicts Anonymous chips?

I need one for court.

He doesn't care about
Sex Addicts Anonymous anymore,

and it's all my fault.

You know where he keeps 'em?

What's going on?

Where's the kid?

Crying

Mrs. Wong's.
His grandmother.

- You let her take him?
- Not forever.

But this is not a healthy
environment for a child.

Jody is out of control,

and he told me this would happen,

and I just pushed him
and pushed him and--

I'm gonna miss
that little half-wit.

I'm just packing up
some of his favorite toys.

Made in China, just like him.

No wonder he likes 'em so much.

Must be a sense memory thing
with the lead paint.

Don't let the kid go.
Fight for him.

How?

I can't have a child here
with Jody's problem.

He just won't even listen.

Well, don't take no for an answer.

We could help him see.

Laughs We?

- An intervention.
- Whoa! No, no, no, no, no.

- Yeah.
- Interventions aren't my thing.

- Oh, Frank! Please.
- My libertarian leanings.

Live and let live.
You understand.

Okay, well, take a day or two
before you have to move out.

Move out?

Which one of you is looking
for an old white woman?

Just booked a first class
ticket to eternal damnation.

Out of rigor mortis,
starting to decompose.

And, lucky for you, set to be cremated.

Won't her family ask questions?

Got a Jane Doe in the back,
never been IDed.

Best thing about ashes--
they all look the same.

- What do you want for her?
- I could use a pick-me-up.

Night shift's killing me.
Phone chimes

- What's your poison?
- I'm not picky.

Hmm. Can you guys
handle it from here?

Mom, she got a little
ambitious on the Ambien.

I'll meet you back at the house.

You'll want to work fast.
She won't stay cold long.

I'll recharge.

I just need some protein. Ho--!

Where the hell did you come from?

- My husband.
- Yeah.

I thought she was lying
about being married, man.

Oh, no, we're married.
Joint bank accounts.

- I can show you the paperwork.
- You go!

- I need my clothes!
- Go now!

I'm naked!

Hey, that wasn't the I.N.S.,
was it?

Ten seconds, all he has!
Push, push, push, done!

You called me here for this?

- Finish me?
- You're kidding.

Okay, so that's all I'm good for now,

is, uh, babysitting
and a-- and a booty call?

Coming?

Hopefully not for at least ten seconds.

 Hey, I've been around the world
with the fantasy girls

 and I ain't never seen
an ass like that

All groaning

- Okay.
- Get the legs.

Jeez, it fucking reeks!

Need the biohazard mask

This is the best we've got.
Cover your nose.

Are we really gonna do this?

We're not taking
any chances. Okay.

Okay, okay. Come on.

All groaning

- You got her?
- Lift up!

- Okay.
- All right.

Okay, okay.
Oh, boy.

Okay, who wants to do the honors?

The real Aunt Ginger lost a toe.

Somebody's got to snip it.
V, you're a nurse.

Not a chance.

Oh, fuck.

- Debbie? What's going on?
- Are you okay?

- I can't talk. Hungry.
- Are they not feeding you?

- Do we have any more milk?
- You're not going back there.

I've got to bring food to the others.

Grab bread and cereal.
We're gonna need grocery bags.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're coming home, Debs, I promise.

What's going on?
Why is Tommy here?

Jody, we're here because
we care about you.

What?

Your drinking is destroying your family!

It's not that kind of intervention.

Oh. Great.

- Intervention?
- Sit down, Jody.

I just dropped a dozen loads.
I need to get some ice.

Sit down. Sit. Sheila
has prepared some remarks.

I have.

"Jody, when you tried
to get me to be intimate

with three of your friends,

it made me feel sad and overextended.

Sex in a committed relationship

shouldn't involve sheets of plastic

and depriving a body
of oxygen."

Sheila, I'm--

"If you do not get the help you need,

you will force me to shut you
out of my life

and the life of my grandson Hymie,

who needs
a healthy environment."

- Sheils.
- Gotta go cold turkey.

- Can we talk about this?
- There's only one way.

Handcuff yourself and sweat it out.

Exhales Okay.

Not that easy.

- Need something from you.
- What?

Chips are earned through
blood, sweat, and tears.

When you've earned them,
you'll get 'em back.

Fair enough.

Over there.

I'm proud of you, Jody.

Thank you, Frank.

We were gone for a few days.

We found her when we got back.

You're Patrick's cousin, right?

- You know Patrick?
- Play softball together.

He's, uh, he's a hell of a bat,

but he can barely make it
to first base without oxygen.

You are in a lot better shape.

Well, that's not saying much.

Cousin Patrick's like
a coronary waiting to happen.

Yeah.

Look, I know this isn't
exactly a great time,

but, uh, are you seeing anyone?

Can we talk about it
after I bury my aunt?

Right.
Sorry.

Um, I'll make sure to pass along
my condolences to Patrick.

Bottles clink

You're sure about this?

It's the only way we can keep
you from resisting your urges.

It's really hard.

I'll be with you the whole time.

No, I mean, it's really hard.

Handcuffs turn me on.

They don't give you extra credit
for showing up early.

- Where's your lawyer?
- In labor, crapping out a kid.

- Representing myself.
- Well, got some bad news.

Aunt Ginger passed away.
Yeah.

On the plus side, it turns out
she left me the house.

- What did you do?
- Only what I had to.

How about a thank you?

Now there's no danger
they'll haul you away

for social security fraud.

No more checks to cash, either.

Fuck you very much.

Always about the money, isn't it?

Work this out inside.
That's why we're here.

I'll see you in there.

- Fiona!
- Hey! I missed you so much!

Hiya! Hi!
Where's my little man? Hi!

- Hey, room for us in here?
- Hi.

- Get the will?
- Yeah, yeah, got it.

- Go file it now.
- Okay.

Mom.

Oh!

Of course I'll make you something.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Britney Sturges,
Department of Family Services.

After receiving a report
about the Gallagher home,

I found the children under
Francis Gallagher's care

in a state of neglect.

We subsequently removed
the children from the home

for their own protection.

Mr. Gallagher,
you want the children back?

They're my kids, Your Honor.

The mother has relinquished
her parental rights.

What does that mean?

Monica doesn't want to be our mom?

She did it for you guys,
so I can bring you home.

And Ms. Gallagher
has filed a petition

to terminate the father's
parental rights.

Yes, Your Honor.

Are you prepared to assume custody?

I am.

I can provide a stable
environment for the kids,

something that has been
sorely lacking with our father.

I have a full-time job,
and I will soon own a home.

Hi, um, Cleopatra.
I'm here to file a will, please.

- Ginger Gallagher.
- Mm-hmm.

- Second one today.
- What?

Had another will filed earlier.

Um, how--
how is that possible?

Well, here's it, uh...

Dated last year.

- It supersedes yours.
- Who the hell filed it?

Patrick Gallagher.

- Cousin Patrick.
- She leave the house to him?

Thank you.

Next!

Eggs Benedict, coming up.

Mmm! Voila!

Uhh!
Laughs

- Toast and some fruit.
- Good.

Mmm!

I owe you an apology.

I never should have said those things.

I never should have made you choose.

Um...

Where is he?
My baby?

He's not living here right now.

Where is he?

He's with his daddy.

He's where he belongs for now,

and you're back where you belong.

I don't deserve him after what I did.

Don't say that.

I don't.

The best thing about mistakes is,

we get to correct them.

His name is Hiram,
and we call him Hymie,

and he is a beautiful,
wonderful baby boy.

Hymie.

Go on.
Eat it while it's hot.

Of course.
Thank you.

I love you.

Your brother Ian testified

about your father's
months-long absence.

Did his disappearance make you sad?

I don't know.

Were you glad when he came back?

He got me into camp.

- Camp?
- My first time.

Had a good time at camp?

Yeah.

Happy when he came back?

I guess.

What about you, Deborah?

Were you glad
when your father came back?

I was glad he wasn't dead.

Did you miss him while he was gone?

Uh, very much.

Did he get you into camp?

Mm-mm. I spent the summer
at the pool.

Daddy helped me learn.

How to swim?

Sort of.
It was a hard summer.

I wouldn't have
made it through without him.

Fiona helped me too.

Mr. Gallagher, you have
very special children.

That's why I had to leave, Your Honor.

I couldn't stand to see them

live through my battles
with addiction any longer.

It's my fight, not theirs.

- So, you left.
- To get help.

Sometimes the hardest part
is admitting you need it,

and I didn't want to come home
until I was clean and sober,

a father they could be proud of.

It isn't easy,

but every day I still have
one of these is a good day.

You're not buying this, are you?

- Ms. Gallagher.
- Have you seen his record?

Right here.

Breaking and entering,
drunk and disorderlies,

public urination,
solicitation, possession,

possession with intent,
domestic disturbance,

four DUIs, and you don't even own a car.

Alcohol is a cruel mistress.

He hasn't stopped drinking,
and he never will.

Your Honor, if I may?

Fiona has been hurt
by my behavior too many times

to believe I've changed.

That's my fault, not hers.

She has kept things going in my absence,

and I will be forever grateful.

I'm not the perfect parent.

I like to have a good time,
to live life to the fullest.

Sometimes I go too far.

But I love my kids.

They mean the world to me.

I don't know--
I don't know what I'd be

if I wasn't a dad.

I'd be nothing.

Please don't take my kids away from me.

Ms. Gallagher,
you want to tell me

why your father should be
declared unfit?

We were living out of a car once.

Uncle Nick had kicked us out.

We couldn't find anyone else
who'd take us in.

Lip and Ian and me
were sleeping in the backseat

when Frank pulled over.

Middle of the night.
Think it was Halstead.

Told me to take the boys
and sit on a curb,

and he'd be right back.

I was six.

Few hours later, we're still
sitting on the sidewalk,

and Ian's head is burning up.

He's hysterical.
I don't know what to do.

So I ran down the street,
Lip under one arm,

Ian under the other,
trying to flag down help.

It would have been easier scoring crack

than a ride to the clinic.

I finally made it on foot.

They said Ian had a fever of 104.

Another couple hours, who knows?

I didn't find Frank
till a couple days later.

First thing he asked me

was how much money I had on me.

I wish I could say
that was the only time,

but it was just the first.

My mother's bipolar

and my father's
an alcoholic and an addict.

He takes what he pleases
and he offers nothing.

No money, no support.

I've done what I could
to help raise my siblings.

I wish I could have done more.

I'm not asking for your pity

or your admiration.

I just want to be able
to give these kids

everything that they deserve,

because they're great kids
and they deserve better.

Chambers, please.

Gavel bangs

I know you didn't ask for it,
but you've got my admiration.

Your siblings are
very fortunate to have you.

I just want to bring 'em home.

Well, from all appearances,

your father's a pathological liar,

and it's just a matter of time
before he screws up again.

Now, it's my job to determine

what's in the best interest
of the children,

and I would rather not
leave them in his care,

but here's my problem.

Neglectful as he may be,

that's not enough to prove abuse.

So you're gonna let him keep
his rights to the kids?

I'm considering
appointing you the guardian,

which would give you legal rights

to make decisions about these kids.

As guardian, you'd have
a legal role in their lives

from here on.

- Okay.
- Hold on.

I said I was considering it.

Taking care of these kids
would be your life.

It already is.

And you're prepared to be
responsible for them

until they're 18?

You have one brother who's two.

That's 16 more years.

If that's what's in their best interest.

Well, what's in your best interest?

I have a daughter,

and when she was around your age,

she went to college.

She traveled across the country.

It was the best time of her life.

Now, if you decide to do this,

there's no changing your mind.

Your siblings come first,
even-- even if you decide

that you want your life back
at some point.

Even if you get married
and you and your husband

want to start a new family.

I appreciate how you feel
about these kids,

but I wouldn't want that
for my daughter.

We're talking about
the rest of your life.

Mr. Gallagher, you have admitted
it's been challenging

to handle this responsibility
on your own.

Now, if I allow you to retain
your parental rights,

would you consent to your daughter

becoming guardian to these children?

They'd still be my kids?

Provided you attend 60 days of AA.

But she'd have all the responsibility?

Not all, but yes.

Works for me.

Would you agree to be the guardian

of these children?

Yes, I do.

Well, that will be my order, then.

Take your children home.

I got Xbox!

- Who wants to hit the pool?
- Oh, me!

I got swim diapers.

I want it.

It's me or the baby.

no parental supervision.

I could probably download one

I'm going to visit Carl and Liam.

He asked for M-80s,
Nintendo DS,

- Could use your help.
- How?

I'm getting custody.

Of us?

It's the only way to bring everyone home

and keep it that way.

Timmy is the father!

It's the law!

give up your rights!

- Fix the baby.

Traditional Chinese medicine.

Special herbs from Guangxi
province. Good as new.

You can't fix Down's Syndrome.
It's an extra chromosome.

We have an herb for chromosome.

Have an herb for everything.

- Nothing. It's for the dog.

Oh!

You don't have to do this.

Custody.
It's a big responsibility.

Lip'll help.
And Ian.

It's permanent.

Exactly. Frank permanently
out of our lives.

Doing Kev's taxes
every year since I was ten

is finally gonna pay off.

You just gotta scan the W-2
and change the name.

Yeah, it's so easy,

it's like they're daring you
to commit fraud.

I don't want to get Kev in trouble.

- Yo, Kev?
- Hey, need a refill?

No. Is it cool if we put
Fiona's name on your W-2?

- Sure. What's a W-2?
- Hmm?

Look, even if he gets pinched, right?

The feds'll figure out pretty quickly

he can't do his own taxes,
let alone fake someone else's.

Anything else?

Yeah. I need you
to get a will notarized.

- A will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

Good news. She died.
We're getting the house.

Will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah. We're gonna
need a body, too.

Uh, where are you gonna get a dead body?

Ringtone

- Sorry to bail. It's my mom.
- Everything okay?

Uh, yeah, it's just divorce

plus copious amounts of chardonnay

equals expensive accidents.

I'll call you later, okay?

Bacardi, and leave the bottle.

Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

Estefania texted 911.
Immigration's at her house.

Told me they were coming tomorrow, man!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Open the door!

Aw, man, what the fuck are you watching?

Cartoons, man.

- Roadrunner is funny as shit.
- Jesus Christ.

Three bracelets and one necklace.

Enough for chicken rings.

- Just two?
- Two earrings.

- Four earrings.
- Two pairs.

Earrings come in pairs.

God helps those who help themselves.

You want 'em or not?

Can I use the bathroom?

Where do you think you're going?

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Tires squeal

Horn honks

Tires squealing

Horn honks

- Ah!
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

Wilton. Steve Wilton.
Estefania's husband. Hi.

Ah.
What are we doing?

Dog barking in distance

- Hey, need a favor.
- Uh-oh.

That's how I started the talk
with my mom.

I hope you're not asking me
to mount your man.

Those geriatrics at the nursing home

drop like flies, right?

Thought it would be,
"Wham, bam, thank you, mom,"

but Kev's sperm
were as gun-shy as he was.

Bought an ovulation calendar.
Have to track her damn cycle.

- You're going again?
- What choice do I have?

At least this way,
I'll know when she's fertile.

I don't want Kevin fucking
my mom any more than he has to.

So, you must lose

a couple of those seniors
at the home a week, right?

More when Bernice is working.

That negligent bitch is like
the grim fucking reaper. Why?

I need a body.
To get the kids back.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

Thanks.
Knew I could count on you.

Father Pete.
Just who I was looking for.

The silver's locked up, Frank.

Laughs

You always had a great
sense of humor, padre.

There's not enough laughs
in religion these days.

Too much fire and brimstone.

- It turns the kids off.
- Got a sermon to write.

While you're putting pen to paper,

how about dashing off
a letter for yours truly?

Kids got taken away again?

Superlatives appreciated.

I wrote you character
references the last two times,

and you're still a deadbeat.

I've turned over a new leaf.

You're the reason we had to
install security cameras.

- Close the door on your way out.
- So that's it?

You're turning away sinners
who are looking for forgiveness?

This-- this is why white kids
are flocking to Allah.

We are in a war for hearts and minds,

and you are shipping American youth

to terror camps in Pakistan.

This is what happens

when you put a German
in charge of the church.

You're not leaving, are you?

You could just reprint

the one you did last time.

Then you'll get the hell out?

Use parish letterhead.

And if he gets a diaper rash,
try the Desitin.

And, um, at night,
sing him Song Sung Blue.

- Song Sung...
- Yeah, he loves Neil Diamond.

I put the words in the diaper bag.

And tickle him.
Don't forget to tickle him.

He loves that,
especially under the armpit.

He laughs so hard.

Are you sure this is what you want?

He should know his dad.
Yeah.

This way, he'll get to be with everyone,

just like a timeshare.

Yeah.
I love you so much, Hymie.

Okay.

Come tomorrow.
Tickle him.

I will.

And we'll see you weekends and holidays.

Don't forget Neil Diamond!

Car door shuts Sweet Caroline...

Car starts

And Cracklin' Rosie get on board!

He loves Neil diamond.

Car door shuts

Sniffles

It's the right thing to do.

Can't see how.
I miss him already.

You want to go upstairs?

Babe?

I should get back to Fiona.

Immigration is getting suspicious.

Not my fault.

How much money do you have
in this account, exactly?

Gas bill.

You're going to be here now
mornings and nights, yes?

In case Immigration makes
another surprise visit?

Yeah, absolutely.
Wouldn't miss it.

- Other than tomorrow.
- Speaking foreign language

Uh, my girlfriend's trying
to adopt her siblings.

The court hearing's tomorrow.

You know, didn't even ask me.
Just assumed I'd be on board.

And why would she ask you?

It's not only her decision.
It affects me too.

You always take care of your family.

Yeah, well, I didn't exactly
sign up for that.

She is too good for you.
Cable.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big. Just some
"walking around" money.

Just a couple grand.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

My parents' money is
tied up in their divorce,

and I'm gonna need some cash

if I'm supporting a whole family now.

You always take care of your family.

You take care of them, not Nando.

There was an old lady
who lived in a shoe.

She's 22.

Had so many kids,
she didn't know what to do.

What difference does it make?
She's been doing the job for years.

- You cool with it?
- Whatever it takes. You?

As long as I don't have to
call her "mom."

- Oh, sh--
- Guess who?

Jimmy's dad?

Hey, you seen Mickey around?

He's been missing.
He owes me 50 bucks.

- He'll be on his feet soon.
- What happened?

- My dad pistol-whipped him.
- Why?

Since when does anyone need
a reason to pistol-whip Mickey?

- Have you signed up yet?
- What for?

S.A.T. The deadline's
tomorrow. I told you.

I'll do it online.
It takes two seconds.

Yeah, you said you'd graduate too,

and you're on your what,
fourth semester of senior year?

My third.
Only two courses left.

All right.
So, where are we going?

Uh, drew up a will.
We need it notarized.

- Ginger Gallagher?
- It's a long story.

Well, it looks like
you wrote down the wrong year.

Uh, no, that's the right year.

What, 2006?

You're taking the S.A.T.?

Not unless someone's paying me.

- Hey.
- You must be Sheila.

Yes?

Jody's told us so much about you.

- Oh.
- Hey.

Hi. Are you
friends of Jody's?

Oh, it was so good to get his call.

Hadn't heard from him in a while.

- Outlet?
- Um, it's around the corner.

- Where do you want the plastic?
- Plastic?

Yeah, the carpet looks nice.
Wouldn't want to ruin it.

Oh, um, let me-- Jody?

Did Jody hire you guys
to work on the house?

Yo, Shawn, this enough lube?

Made a Costco run.
Got another in the car.

Should last us for round one, right?

Jody!

What's up, fellas?
You stretch yet, old man?

Yeah, yeah. Where do you
want the Gatorade?

- Uh, the fridge is fine.
- Can I, um, talk to you?

- You meet the guys?
- Yeah, I-I did.

I'll be right back.
Ow. What's-- what's wrong?

- Get them out of here!
- Why?

- I thought you'd be into it.
- Are you nuts?

I figured it'd get your mind off stuff.

I was right to have Hymie
go with the Wongs!

What?

This is not a healthy
environment for a child.

You mean I'm the reason he's gone?

Clears throat

So is-- is this gonna
happen or what?

I gotta pick up my daughter
from ballet in an hour.

- No! It is not!
- Yes! Yes, it is!

- Somewhere else.
- Don't sweat it.

I got an eVite to a bukkake
party on the West Side.

Sweet. All right, guys.
Let's get out of here.

Jody?
Jody.

Dog barking in distance

Hey, thanks for getting the deadbolt.

- Hey.
- How's your mom?

- Just needed a little TLC.
- I need to find Frank.

- Oh, he's upstairs.
- You let him in?

No, he was already raiding
the fridge when I got here.

You seen my suit?

I'm gonna take the kids off your hands.

All you gotta do is sign a form.

Can't find anything
in this goddamn house.

Did you hear me?
I want the kids.

If you want a kid so bad,
toss your birth control pills.

I want you to give up
your parental rights.

I'm serious. Look.
I already got Monica to sign.

You'd have to find her first.

- Where is she?
- Not telling you.

She's my wife.

If she wanted you to know where she is,

she would have told you herself.

Now, you gonna sign the form?

- No!
- She did.

- She would never do that.
- I got a witness.

It's not like you want your kids anyway.

They're my kids!

You're the one who called DFS on 'em

to have them taken away!

- Bullshit!
- I heard the tape.

I never fucking called anybody.

Of course you don't remember.
You're drunk all the time.

Just tell me what it's gonna take.

What? Suddenly, you give
a shit about your kids?

You don't want to sign, fine.

I'll have you declared unfit.
I already got a lawyer.

- I'm getting the kids.
- You're not taking my kids!

It's Veronica. Says
she's got a dead body for you.

- All right.
- Hey, V.

Groans I'm hungry.

Make more earrings.
They're easier.

Gotta escape.
Get food.

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Could attack her with scissors.

That's like going after
a rhino with a butter knife.

Oh, you call that a cross?

Give me the damn Krazy Glue, Carley.

Give me your Benadryl.

Now, this is a cross Jesus
would be proud to be nailed to.

You want to play with this?
All right.

Hey, careful with those throwing stars.

They could pierce a jugular.

- You gotta get me out of here.
- Why?

They took my rifle,

they make me brush my teeth
after every meal,

they're always around,
seeing if I'm okay.

Do you mean they're
trying to be good parents?

Uh, don't forget, Carl.
Church in ten minutes.

Text alert

Shit.

That's Fiona.
I gotta go meet her.

But, hey, um, see if you can get

the security codes for this place.

We'll come back in a couple months

and steal a bunch of this shit,
all right?

Hang in there.

Come on, Mandy, we gotta go.

See you, buddy.

Bye.

you've been pistol-whipped
and shot in the ass?

what happened.

What's going on?

Where's the kid?

Crying

Mrs. Wong's.
His grandmother.

- You let her take him?
- Not forever.

But this is not a healthy
environment for a child.

Jody is out of control,

and he told me this would happen,

and I just pushed him
and pushed him and--

I'm gonna miss
that little half-wit.

I'm just packing up
some of his favorite toys.

Made in China, just like him.

No wonder he likes 'em so much.

Must be a sense memory thing
with the lead paint.

Don't let the kid go.
Fight for him.

How?

I can't have a child here
with Jody's problem.

He just won't even listen.

Well, don't take no for an answer.

We could help him see.

Laughs We?

- An intervention.
- Whoa! No, no, no, no, no.

- Yeah.
- Interventions aren't my thing.

- Oh, Frank! Please.
- My libertarian leanings.

Live and let live.
You understand.

Okay, well, take a day or two
before you have to move out.

Move out?

Which one of you is looking
for an old white woman?

Just booked a first class
ticket to eternal damnation.

Out of rigor mortis,
starting to decompose.

And, lucky for you, set to be cremated.

Won't her family ask questions?

Got a Jane Doe in the back,
never been IDed.

Best thing about ashes--
they all look the same.

- What do you want for her?
- I could use a pick-me-up.

Night shift's killing me.

- What's your poison?
- I'm not picky.

Hmm. Can you guys

Mom, she got a little

I'll meet you back at the house.

You'll want to work fast.
She won't stay cold long.

Oh, no, we're married.

was it?

Push, push, push, done!

You called me here for this?

- Finish me?
- You're kidding.

Okay, so that's all I'm good for now,

is, uh, babysitting
and a-- and a booty call?

Coming?

Hopefully not for at least ten seconds.

 Hey, I've been around the world
with the fantasy girls

 and I ain't never seen
an ass like that

- Okay.
- Get the legs.

Jeez, it fucking reeks!

Are we really gonna do this?

We're not taking
any chances. Okay.

Okay, okay. Come on.

All groaning

- You got her?
- Lift up!

- Okay.
- All right.

Okay, okay.
Oh, boy.

Okay, who wants to do the honors?

The real Aunt Ginger lost a toe.

Somebody's got to snip it.

Oh, fuck.

we care about you.

What?

Your drinking is destroying your family!

It's not that kind of intervention.

Oh. Great.

- Intervention?
- Sit down, Jody.

I just dropped a dozen loads.
I need to get some ice.

Sit down. Sit. Sheila
has prepared some remarks.

I have.

"Jody, when you tried
to get me to be intimate

with three of your friends,

it made me feel sad and overextended.

Sex in a committed relationship

shouldn't involve sheets of plastic

and depriving a body
of oxygen."

Sheila, I'm--

"If you do not get the help you need,

you will force me to shut you
out of my life

and the life of my grandson Hymie,

who needs
a healthy environment."

- Sheils.
- Gotta go cold turkey.

- Can we talk about this?
- There's only one way.

Handcuff yourself and sweat it out.

Exhales Okay.

Not that easy.

- Need something from you.
- What?

Chips are earned through

Fair enough.

Over there.

I'm proud of you, Jody.

Thank you, Frank.

He's, uh, he's a hell of a bat,

but he can barely make it
to first base without oxygen.

You are in a lot better shape.

Well, that's not saying much.

Cousin Patrick's like
a coronary waiting to happen.

Yeah.

Look, I know this isn't
exactly a great time,

but, uh, are you seeing anyone?

Can we talk about it
after I bury my aunt?

Right.
Sorry.

Um, I'll make sure to pass along
my condolences to Patrick.

Aunt Ginger passed away.
Yeah.

On the plus side, it turns out
she left me the house.

- What did you do?
- Only what I had to.

How about a thank you?

Now there's no danger
they'll haul you away

for social security fraud.

No more checks to cash, either.

Fuck you very much.

Always about the money, isn't it?

Work this out inside.
That's why we're here.

I'll see you in there.

- Fiona!
- Hey! I missed you so much!

Hiya! Hi!
Where's my little man? Hi!

- Hey, room for us in here?

Thank you, Your Honor.

Britney Sturges,
Department of Family Services.

After receiving a report
about the Gallagher home,

I found the children under
Francis Gallagher's care

in a state of neglect.

We subsequently removed
the children from the home

for their own protection.

Mr. Gallagher,
you want the children back?

They're my kids, Your Honor.

The mother has relinquished
her parental rights.

What does that mean?

Monica doesn't want to be our mom?

She did it for you guys,
so I can bring you home.

And Ms. Gallagher
has filed a petition

to terminate the father's
parental rights.

Yes, Your Honor.

Are you prepared to assume custody?

I am.

I can provide a stable
environment for the kids,

something that has been
sorely lacking with our father.

I have a full-time job,
and I will soon own a home.

Hi, um, Cleopatra.
I'm here to file a will, please.

- Ginger Gallagher.
- Mm-hmm.

- Second one today.
- What?

Had another will filed earlier.

Um, how--
how is that possible?

Well, here's it, uh...

Dated last year.

- It supersedes yours.
- Who the hell filed it?

Patrick Gallagher.

- Cousin Patrick.
- She leave the house to him?

Thank you.

Next!

Eggs Benedict, coming up.

Mmm! Voila!

Uhh!
Laughs

- Toast and some fruit.
- Good.

Mmm!

I owe you an apology.

I never should have said those things.

I never should have made you choose.

Um...

Where is he?
My baby?

He's not living here right now.

Where is he?

He's with his daddy.

He's where he belongs for now,

and you're back where you belong.

I don't deserve him after what I did.

Don't say that.

I don't.

The best thing about mistakes is,

we get to correct them.

His name is Hiram,
and we call him Hymie,

and he is a beautiful,
wonderful baby boy.

Hymie.

Go on.
Eat it while it's hot.

Of course.
Thank you.

I love you.

Your brother Ian testified

about your father's
months-long absence.

Did his disappearance make you sad?

I don't know.

Were you glad when he came back?

He got me into camp.

- Camp?
- My first time.

Had a good time at camp?

Yeah.

Happy when he came back?

I guess.

What about you, Deborah?

Were you glad
when your father came back?

I was glad he wasn't dead.

Did you miss him while he was gone?

Uh, very much.

Did he get you into camp?

Mm-mm. I spent the summer
at the pool.

Daddy helped me learn.

How to swim?

Sort of.
It was a hard summer.

I wouldn't have
made it through without him.

Fiona helped me too.

Mr. Gallagher, you have
very special children.

That's why I had to leave, Your Honor.

I couldn't stand to see them

live through my battles
with addiction any longer.

It's my fight, not theirs.

- So, you left.
- To get help.

Sometimes the hardest part
is admitting you need it,

and I didn't want to come home
until I was clean and sober,

a father they could be proud of.

It isn't easy,

but every day I still have
one of these is a good day.

You're not buying this, are you?

- Ms. Gallagher.
- Have you seen his record?

Right here.

Breaking and entering,
drunk and disorderlies,

public urination,
solicitation, possession,

possession with intent,
domestic disturbance,

four DUIs, and you don't even own a car.

Alcohol is a cruel mistress.

He hasn't stopped drinking,
and he never will.

Your Honor, if I may?

Fiona has been hurt
by my behavior too many times

to believe I've changed.

That's my fault, not hers.

She has kept things going in my absence,

and I will be forever grateful.

I'm not the perfect parent.

I like to have a good time,
to live life to the fullest.

Sometimes I go too far.

But I love my kids.

They mean the world to me.

I don't know--
I don't know what I'd be

if I wasn't a dad.

I'd be nothing.

Please don't take my kids away from me.

Ms. Gallagher,
you want to tell me

why your father should be
declared unfit?

We were living out of a car once.

Uncle Nick had kicked us out.

We couldn't find anyone else
who'd take us in.

Lip and Ian and me
were sleeping in the backseat

when Frank pulled over.

Middle of the night.
Think it was Halstead.

Told me to take the boys
and sit on a curb,

and he'd be right back.

I was six.

Few hours later, we're still
sitting on the sidewalk,

and Ian's head is burning up.

He's hysterical.
I don't know what to do.

So I ran down the street,
Lip under one arm,

Ian under the other,
trying to flag down help.

It would have been easier scoring crack

than a ride to the clinic.

I finally made it on foot.

They said Ian had a fever of 104.

Another couple hours, who knows?

I didn't find Frank
till a couple days later.

First thing he asked me

was how much money I had on me.

I wish I could say
that was the only time,

but it was just the first.

My mother's bipolar

and my father's
an alcoholic and an addict.

He takes what he pleases
and he offers nothing.

No money, no support.

I've done what I could
to help raise my siblings.

I wish I could have done more.

I'm not asking for your pity

or your admiration.

I just want to be able
to give these kids

everything that they deserve,

because they're great kids
and they deserve better.

Chambers, please.

Gavel bangs

I know you didn't ask for it,
but you've got my admiration.

Your siblings are
very fortunate to have you.

I just want to bring 'em home.

Well, from all appearances,

your father's a pathological liar,

and it's just a matter of time
before he screws up again.

Now, it's my job to determine

what's in the best interest
of the children,

and I would rather not
leave them in his care,

but here's my problem.

Neglectful as he may be,

that's not enough to prove abuse.

So you're gonna let him keep
his rights to the kids?

I'm considering
appointing you the guardian,

which would give you legal rights

to make decisions about these kids.

As guardian, you'd have
a legal role in their lives

from here on.

- Okay.
- Hold on.

I said I was considering it.

Taking care of these kids
would be your life.

It already is.

And you're prepared to be
responsible for them

until they're 18?

You have one brother who's two.

That's 16 more years.

If that's what's in their best interest.

Well, what's in your best interest?

I have a daughter,

and when she was around your age,

she went to college.

She traveled across the country.

It was the best time of her life.

Now, if you decide to do this,

there's no changing your mind.

Your siblings come first,
even-- even if you decide

that you want your life back
at some point.

Even if you get married
and you and your husband

want to start a new family.

I appreciate how you feel
about these kids,

but I wouldn't want that
for my daughter.

We're talking about
the rest of your life.

Mr. Gallagher, you have admitted
it's been challenging

to handle this responsibility
on your own.

Now, if I allow you to retain
your parental rights,

would you consent to your daughter

becoming guardian to these children?

They'd still be my kids?

Provided you attend 60 days of AA.

But she'd have all the responsibility?

Not all, but yes.

Works for me.

Would you agree to be the guardian

of these children?

Yes, I do.

Well, that will be my order, then.

Take your children home.

Gavel bangs

Cheering

Laughter

Oh!

Upbeat music

You gonna tell her about the house?

Not yet.

I got my kids back!

Laughs

Drinks on the house!

Just one.
Just one.

- Just one.
- Just one.

We'll start with one.

So, where are the kids at, Frank?

Eh, fuck if I know.
Who's got the next round?

I got Xbox!

- Who wants to hit the pool?
- Oh, me!

I got swim diapers.

Laughs

Guess we're not getting
our own place anytime soon.

I'll grab towels!

Upbeat music

 Put the window down

 move on over here

Gasps

Jody?

Are you blowing yourself?

Hey.
When'd you get home?

Here's what you missed
on Shameless last time.

Not too much. It
was kind of light last week.

Jesus Christ!
I need you to do this!

I need you to get your shit
together and get the kids back.

No drugs, no booze.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

That's why the good lord
put me here--

so I can take in all his babies

don't nobody else want.

Rule number one. No sitting
on the good furniture.

We have filed the paperwork
to adopt Liam.

Oh, no, Liam.

Did you pee on the couch again
and the wall too?

How the hell are we gonna get that out?

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

It's me or the baby.

What is that for?

Sex swing.

Oh, God.

It's good for us to grow.

No!

No, we're just taking fake
wedding pictures for the I.N.S.

I hate this I.N.S. bullshit.

Aw, shit.

What the fuck?

Get the fuck up!
Both groaning

No son of mine is gonna be
a goddamn AIDS monkey.

Who reported us?

I would like to report
a negligence situation.

Six kids living in squalor,
no parental supervision.

If it's all right, I would like
to remain anonymous.

High Strung's The Luck You Got

 Think of all the luck you got

 know that it's not for naught

 you were beaming once before

 but it's not like that anymore

 what is this downside

 that you speak of?

 what is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

 round up the friends you got

 know that they're not for naught

 you were willing once before

 but it's not like that anymore

 what is this downside

 that you speak of?

 what is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

- Get the locks?
- Hardware store isn't open.

Did you knock?
Manny sleeps upstairs.

- I'll get it.
- Let's go.

Deadbolts, front and back.
Frank's not allowed in anymore.

- You gonna rip him a new one?
- We're done with him.

Let's go. Come on.
Don't want to be late.

You sure about this?

Opera music playing

What the hell?
TV's broken.

Uh, parental controls.

We wouldn't want you stumbling
onto something you shouldn't.

That's the only reason to watch.

It still gets Discovery Kids,
Disney, and Bravo.

Come on. Put the remote down.
It's time for your bath.

How many damn times do I have to smell

like mango and pomegranate?

Uh, if you think I'm gonna let
you near your tutor without one,

you got another thing coming, young man.

- Tutor?
- To brush up on your math.

- You're two grade levels behind.
- Only two?

- Daddy!
- I missed you, baby.

They finally let Maria's dad
out of prison, huh?

He'll be back.
So will she.

Till then, drop the mop.
Come on.

You want me to do laundry first?

You're going to replace her.

Downstairs.

Downstairs?

You gonna make me push you down?

Rock music

Okay, all right,
find a seat and get busy.

Debbie, here!
Next to me.

You can share my Krazy Glue.

She forces us to make jewelry?

Oh, no. You don't have to.
Not if you aren't hungry.

One bracelet gets you a burger.
Four earrings, French fries.

Blows

I don't think this is legal.

Used to be only
a couple of us down here,

but business took off when Mama Kamala

started slapping those
"made in Africa" stickers on.

Dust gets my allergies going.

Yeah, well, the mold and
rat droppings can't be helping.

I'd take more, but it makes me sleepy.

Idle hands are the devil's work, hmm?

Last one.

If I had a dime for every time
I heard you say that,

I'd have exactly one dime.

Court hearing's tomorrow.

I thought you already pissed in a cup.

Spot test. Anything to keep
families apart. One more.

Amen, Frank. Gestapo tried
to declare me an unfit parent.

You brought a crack pipe
to the courthouse.

Who the hell tries to run a crack pipe

through a metal detector?

I know the dog and pony--
show up in a suit,

flash some AA chips,
character reference.

They'll hand the brats right over.

Well, it's nice to know
the bar is set so high.

Nothing more American
than a second chance.

Or a third or a fourth.

Redemption, tugs at the heartstrings.

- Shot for the road.
- Oh, you be careful, Frank.

Those child-stealing liberal
bastards are out for blood.

Broke my judicial cherry
years ago, Chester.

They will never take my kids from me.

I want the kids.

- Groans Your parents know?
- Not yet.

They'll relinquish their rights?

My dad's made a career
of refusing responsibility.

- Mom's M.I.A.
- What are my chances?

Cases I take are all about

whether a kid's gonna live
in Aspen or Monaco.

Well, my brother said you'd help.

I told Chip I'd give you five minutes.

- Please, Mr. Redel.
- You can't afford me.

- You do pro bono?
- As little as possible.

My brothers and sister
are in foster homes,

and my father is the reason why.

I need custody now
so I can get them home,

and you're not going anywhere
until you tell me how to do it.

Sighs

You know, the firm makes me do
one pro Bono case a year,

and I guess this won't be
as bad as representing

those scary motherfuckers
at the innocence project.

What do I have to do?

Get your parents
to terminate their rights

and prove you can provide
a stable environment.

Get W-2s to show
you've got a full-time job.

You got a place for the kids to live?

Uh-huh.

Hey, get your arm out of the door

so I can go bill somebody?

Thanks.

Baby's finally asleep.

Oh, no.

Should be able to
squeeze in a good 40 minutes

before he's back up.

Jody.

Babe, this is gonna blow your mind.

What if I don't want my mind blown?

All I'm gonna be thinking
about while you choke me out

is how much I love you.

Sweetheart, I can't hang you.

I hang myself.

I just need you to cut me down
when I pass out.

Knocking on door

Aah!

- Do not do this!
- No!

Take this down!
I gotta get that!

Gasping

Get down!

Yeah, that'll work.

Oh, hello.
Can I help you?

Show-- tell her.

Uh, I think you have my baby in there.

- Uh, we need it back.
- What?

You have an Asian baby in there.

Speaking Chinese Baby.

Uh, my mom wants it back.

Tell us your name.

Paula.

Alcoholic.

Applause
Welcome, Paula.

Keep coming back, Paula.

Keep coming back.
Keep coming back.

All right, would anyone
like a 30-day chip?

Right here.
Right here.

Let's skip the hug.
It's a little gay.

Bullshit!

30 days? Frank hasn't been
sober for 30 minutes.

Mind your own business.

I can smell the booze from here.

- Just give me the chip.
- Don't do it!

Just let me borrow it.

You've got to earn the chip
like we all did,

through blood, sweat, and tears.

Only requirement for membership

is the desire to stop drinking.

Exactly.

If I'm tempted by the bottle,

I can look to the chip
for encouragement.

Pay it forward, Nance.

This meeting is for people

who have changed their lives
for the better, Frank.

Come on.

Can't do it.

For the better?

You're all dying
a slow, miserable death,

thanks to this cult
of self-improvement.

Drop off the kids,
9:00 to 5:00, PTA, AA.

You call that a life?
This ain't North Korea.

- Alcohol is a gift.
- It's time to go!

Nance, what happened to you?

You used to dance on tables!

Now it's cleaning your dad's catheter

and the graveyard shift
at the drugstore!

You're young!
Don't pack it in!

All right.
All right, slow down.

- I need to make a will.
- What?

I could probably download one
from the Internet.

- All right. For who?
- Aunt Ginger.

I gotta finally make it official.

I'm getting the house.

And I need a W-2
to show I have a job.

It doesn't matter

if you can't get Monica
to sign away her rights.

I don't need her to sign.

I was forging doctor's notes
in first grade.

Hey.

Hey, I thought I heard the door.

They let you out of the group home?

Oh, yeah.
They cut us loose from dawn till dusk.

I found them.

I'm going to visit Carl and Liam.

He asked for M-80s,
Nintendo DS,

and ninja throwing stars.

- Could use your help.
- How?

I'm getting custody.

Of us?

It's the only way to bring everyone home

and keep it that way.

Timmy is the father!
The father gets the baby!

It's the law!

Tell them, you never
give up your rights!

Well, we got rights too, lady!

If we want to get rid
of a kid, we stay in China!

Crying

Show me the baby!

Don't you do it.

- She is his grandmother.
- So are you.

- Please.
- Okay, okay.

Crying

What's wrong?
You break him?

- He's got Down's Syndrome.
- We fix him.

- Fix him?
- Fix the baby.

Traditional Chinese medicine.

Special herbs from Guangxi
province. Good as new.

You can't fix Down's Syndrome.
It's an extra chromosome.

We have an herb for chromosome.

Have an herb for everything.
Chromosome goes away.

Isn't that right, beautiful boy?

- What's this?
- Nothing. It's for the dog.

Here. Sparky!
Whistles

Can I hold him?

Oh!

Where's the mother?
Father is here.

Baby needs a father.
We have a big family.

Many little cousins to play with.

What's taking so long?

You don't have to do this.

Custody.
It's a big responsibility.

Lip'll help.
And Ian.

It's permanent.

Exactly. Frank permanently
out of our lives.

Doing Kev's taxes
every year since I was ten

is finally gonna pay off.

You just gotta scan the W-2
and change the name.

Yeah, it's so easy,

it's like they're daring you
to commit fraud.

I don't want to get Kev in trouble.

- Yo, Kev?
- Hey, need a refill?

No. Is it cool if we put
Fiona's name on your W-2?

- Sure. What's a W-2?
- Hmm?

Look, even if he gets pinched, right?

The feds'll figure out pretty quickly

he can't do his own taxes,
let alone fake someone else's.

Anything else?

Yeah. I need you
to get a will notarized.

- A will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

Good news. She died.
We're getting the house.

Will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah. We're gonna
need a body, too.

Uh, where are you gonna get a dead body?

Ringtone

- Sorry to bail. It's my mom.
- Everything okay?

Uh, yeah, it's just divorce

plus copious amounts of chardonnay

equals expensive accidents.

I'll call you later, okay?

Bacardi, and leave the bottle.

Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

Estefania texted 911.
Immigration's at her house.

Told me they were coming tomorrow, man!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Open the door!

Aw, man, what the fuck are you watching?

Cartoons, man.

- Roadrunner is funny as shit.
- Jesus Christ.

Three bracelets and one necklace.

Enough for chicken rings.

- Just two?
- Two earrings.

- Four earrings.
- Two pairs.

Earrings come in pairs.

God helps those who help themselves.

You want 'em or not?

Can I use the bathroom?

Where do you think you're going?

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Tires squeal

Horn honks

Tires squealing

Horn honks

- Ah!
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

Wilton. Steve Wilton.
Estefania's husband. Hi.

Ah.
What are we doing?

Dog barking in distance

- Hey, need a favor.
- Uh-oh.

That's how I started the talk
with my mom.

I hope you're not asking me
to mount your man.

Those geriatrics at the nursing home

drop like flies, right?

Thought it would be,
"Wham, bam, thank you, mom,"

but Kev's sperm
were as gun-shy as he was.

Bought an ovulation calendar.
Have to track her damn cycle.

- You're going again?
- What choice do I have?

At least this way,
I'll know when she's fertile.

I don't want Kevin fucking
my mom any more than he has to.

So, you must lose

a couple of those seniors
at the home a week, right?

More when Bernice is working.

That negligent bitch is like
the grim fucking reaper. Why?

I need a body.
To get the kids back.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

Thanks.
Knew I could count on you.

Father Pete.
Just who I was looking for.

The silver's locked up, Frank.

Laughs

You always had a great
sense of humor, padre.

There's not enough laughs
in religion these days.

Too much fire and brimstone.

- It turns the kids off.
- Got a sermon to write.

While you're putting pen to paper,

how about dashing off
a letter for yours truly?

Kids got taken away again?

Superlatives appreciated.

I wrote you character
references the last two times,

and you're still a deadbeat.

I've turned over a new leaf.

You're the reason we had to
install security cameras.

- Close the door on your way out.
- So that's it?

You're turning away sinners
who are looking for forgiveness?

This-- this is why white kids
are flocking to Allah.

We are in a war for hearts and minds,

and you are shipping American youth

to terror camps in Pakistan.

This is what happens

when you put a German
in charge of the church.

You're not leaving, are you?

You could just reprint

the one you did last time.

Then you'll get the hell out?

Use parish letterhead.

And if he gets a diaper rash,
try the Desitin.

And, um, at night,
sing him Song Sung Blue.

- Song Sung...
- Yeah, he loves Neil Diamond.

I put the words in the diaper bag.

And tickle him.
Don't forget to tickle him.

He loves that,
especially under the armpit.

He laughs so hard.

Are you sure this is what you want?

He should know his dad.
Yeah.

This way, he'll get to be with everyone,

just like a timeshare.

Yeah.
I love you so much, Hymie.

Okay.

Come tomorrow.
Tickle him.

I will.

And we'll see you weekends and holidays.

Don't forget Neil Diamond!

Car door shuts Sweet Caroline...

Car starts

And Cracklin' Rosie get on board!

He loves Neil diamond.

Car door shuts

Sniffles

It's the right thing to do.

Can't see how.
I miss him already.

You want to go upstairs?

Babe?

I should get back to Fiona.

Immigration is getting suspicious.

Not my fault.

How much money do you have
in this account, exactly?

Gas bill.

You're going to be here now
mornings and nights, yes?

In case Immigration makes
another surprise visit?

Yeah, absolutely.
Wouldn't miss it.

- Other than tomorrow.
- Speaking foreign language

Uh, my girlfriend's trying
to adopt her siblings.

The court hearing's tomorrow.

You know, didn't even ask me.
Just assumed I'd be on board.

And why would she ask you?

It's not only her decision.
It affects me too.

You always take care of your family.

Yeah, well, I didn't exactly
sign up for that.

She is too good for you.
Cable.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big. Just some
"walking around" money.

Just a couple grand.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

My parents' money is
tied up in their divorce,

and I'm gonna need some cash

if I'm supporting a whole family now.

You always take care of your family.

You take care of them, not Nando.

There was an old lady
who lived in a shoe.

She's 22.

Had so many kids,
she didn't know what to do.

What difference does it make?
She's been doing the job for years.

- You cool with it?
- Whatever it takes. You?

As long as I don't have to
call her "mom."

- Oh, sh--
- Guess who?

Jimmy's dad?

Hey, you seen Mickey around?

He's been missing.
He owes me 50 bucks.

- He'll be on his feet soon.
- What happened?

- My dad pistol-whipped him.
- Why?

Since when does anyone need
a reason to pistol-whip Mickey?

- Have you signed up yet?
- What for?

S.A.T. The deadline's
tomorrow. I told you.

I'll do it online.
It takes two seconds.

Yeah, you said you'd graduate too,

and you're on your what,
fourth semester of senior year?

My third.
Only two courses left.

All right.
So, where are we going?

Uh, drew up a will.
We need it notarized.

- Ginger Gallagher?
- It's a long story.

Well, it looks like
you wrote down the wrong year.

Uh, no, that's the right year.

What, 2006?

You're taking the S.A.T.?

Not unless someone's paying me.

- Hey.
- You must be Sheila.

Yes?

Jody's told us so much about you.

- Oh.
- Hey.

Hi. Are you
friends of Jody's?

Oh, it was so good to get his call.

Hadn't heard from him in a while.

- Outlet?
- Um, it's around the corner.

- Where do you want the plastic?
- Plastic?

Yeah, the carpet looks nice.
Wouldn't want to ruin it.

Oh, um, let me-- Jody?

Did Jody hire you guys
to work on the house?

Yo, Shawn, this enough lube?

Made a Costco run.
Got another in the car.

Should last us for round one, right?

Jody!

What's up, fellas?
You stretch yet, old man?

Yeah, yeah. Where do you
want the Gatorade?

- Uh, the fridge is fine.
- Can I, um, talk to you?

- You meet the guys?
- Yeah, I-I did.

I'll be right back.
Ow. What's-- what's wrong?

- Get them out of here!
- Why?

- I thought you'd be into it.
- Are you nuts?

I figured it'd get your mind off stuff.

I was right to have Hymie
go with the Wongs!

What?

This is not a healthy
environment for a child.

You mean I'm the reason he's gone?

Clears throat

So is-- is this gonna
happen or what?

I gotta pick up my daughter
from ballet in an hour.

- No! It is not!
- Yes! Yes, it is!

- Somewhere else.
- Don't sweat it.

I got an eVite to a bukkake
party on the West Side.

Sweet. All right, guys.
Let's get out of here.

Jody?
Jody.

Dog barking in distance

Hey, thanks for getting the deadbolt.

- Hey.
- How's your mom?

- Just needed a little TLC.
- I need to find Frank.

- Oh, he's upstairs.
- You let him in?

No, he was already raiding
the fridge when I got here.

You seen my suit?

I'm gonna take the kids off your hands.

All you gotta do is sign a form.

Can't find anything
in this goddamn house.

Did you hear me?
I want the kids.

If you want a kid so bad,
toss your birth control pills.

I want you to give up
your parental rights.

I'm serious. Look.
I already got Monica to sign.

You'd have to find her first.

- Where is she?
- Not telling you.

She's my wife.

If she wanted you to know where she is,

she would have told you herself.

Now, you gonna sign the form?

- No!
- She did.

- She would never do that.
- I got a witness.

It's not like you want your kids anyway.

They're my kids!

You're the one who called DFS on 'em

to have them taken away!

- Bullshit!
- I heard the tape.

I never fucking called anybody.

Of course you don't remember.
You're drunk all the time.

Just tell me what it's gonna take.

What? Suddenly, you give
a shit about your kids?

You don't want to sign, fine.

I'll have you declared unfit.
I already got a lawyer.

- I'm getting the kids.
- You're not taking my kids!

It's Veronica. Says
she's got a dead body for you.

- All right.
- Hey, V.

Groans I'm hungry.

Make more earrings.
They're easier.

Gotta escape.
Get food.

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Could attack her with scissors.

That's like going after
a rhino with a butter knife.

Oh, you call that a cross?

Give me the damn Krazy Glue, Carley.

Give me your Benadryl.

Now, this is a cross Jesus
would be proud to be nailed to.

You want to play with this?
All right.

Hey, careful with those throwing stars.

They could pierce a jugular.

- You gotta get me out of here.
- Why?

They took my rifle,

they make me brush my teeth
after every meal,

they're always around,
seeing if I'm okay.

Do you mean they're
trying to be good parents?

Uh, don't forget, Carl.
Church in ten minutes.

Text alert

Shit.

That's Fiona.
I gotta go meet her.

But, hey, um, see if you can get

the security codes for this place.

We'll come back in a couple months

and steal a bunch of this shit,
all right?

Hang in there.

Come on, Mandy, we gotta go.

See you, buddy.

Bye.

Gunshots

So, uh, thanks to me,

you've been pistol-whipped
and shot in the ass?

Gunshot

Just want to make sure you're okay.

Gunshot

Hey, I can't stop thinking about it,

what happened.

Would you at least look at me?

Gunshot

Fine.

Gunshot

Toy squeaks

Hey, seen any of your boyfriend's

Sex Addicts Anonymous chips?

I need one for court.

He doesn't care about
Sex Addicts Anonymous anymore,

and it's all my fault.

You know where he keeps 'em?

What's going on?

Where's the kid?

Crying

Mrs. Wong's.
His grandmother.

- You let her take him?
- Not forever.

But this is not a healthy
environment for a child.

Jody is out of control,

and he told me this would happen,

and I just pushed him
and pushed him and--

I'm gonna miss
that little half-wit.

I'm just packing up
some of his favorite toys.

Made in China, just like him.

No wonder he likes 'em so much.

Must be a sense memory thing
with the lead paint.

Don't let the kid go.
Fight for him.

How?

I can't have a child here
with Jody's problem.

He just won't even listen.

Well, don't take no for an answer.

We could help him see.

Laughs We?

- An intervention.
- Whoa! No, no, no, no, no.

- Yeah.
- Interventions aren't my thing.

- Oh, Frank! Please.
- My libertarian leanings.

Live and let live.
You understand.

Okay, well, take a day or two
before you have to move out.

Move out?

Dogs barking in distance

Laronda.
Come on, Laronda.

This is our chance.

- No.
- Groans

Snoring

Mama Kamala sees everything, hmm?

I can't believe I'm doing this.

- You take care of the will?
- Signed and notarized.

Knocks on door
Lanny.

I told you.
Two taps, then three.

Forgot the code.
Let us in?

Which one of you is looking
for an old white woman?

Just booked a first class
ticket to eternal damnation.

Out of rigor mortis,
starting to decompose.

And, lucky for you, set to be cremated.

Won't her family ask questions?

Got a Jane Doe in the back,
never been IDed.

Best thing about ashes--
they all look the same.

- What do you want for her?
- I could use a pick-me-up.

Night shift's killing me.
Phone chimes

- What's your poison?
- I'm not picky.

Hmm. Can you guys
handle it from here?

Mom, she got a little
ambitious on the Ambien.

I'll meet you back at the house.

You'll want to work fast.
She won't stay cold long.

Shouting in Portuguese

Shouting in Portuguese

I told you, I don't speak Spanish.

Get the fuck out!

Give me a couple minutes.
I'll recharge.

You got any roast beef?
I just need some protein. Ho--!

Where the hell did you come from?

- My husband.
- Yeah.

I thought she was lying
about being married, man.

Oh, no, we're married.
Joint bank accounts.

- I can show you the paperwork.
- You go!

- I need my clothes!
- Go now!

I'm naked!

Hey, that wasn't the I.N.S.,
was it?

Ten seconds, all he has!
Push, push, push, done!

You called me here for this?

- Finish me?
- You're kidding.

Okay, so that's all I'm good for now,

is, uh, babysitting
and a-- and a booty call?

Coming?

Hopefully not for at least ten seconds.

 Hey, I've been around the world
with the fantasy girls

 and I ain't never seen
an ass like that

All groaning

- Okay.
- Get the legs.

Jeez, it fucking reeks!

Need the biohazard mask
they use when Ebola breaks out.

This is the best we've got.
Cover your nose.

Lip, get her fucking legs, man.

Are we really gonna do this?

We're not taking
any chances. Okay.

Okay, okay. Come on.

All groaning

- You got her?
- Lift up!

- Okay.
- All right.

Okay, okay.
Oh, boy.

Sighs

Okay, who wants to do the honors?

The real Aunt Ginger lost a toe.

Somebody's got to snip it.
V, you're a nurse.

Not a chance.

All right.
Oh, fuck.

Won't it bleed?

Heart's stopped pumping.

Oh, fuck.
No, no, no, no. Oh!

Glue it shut when I'm done.

Groans

Door opens

- Debbie? What's going on?
- Are you okay?

- I can't talk. Hungry.
- Are they not feeding you?

- Do we have any more milk?
- You're not going back there.

I've got to bring food to the others.

Grab bread and cereal.
We're gonna need grocery bags.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're coming home, Debs, I promise.

Sheila, can you get me the ice pack?

What's going on?
Why is Tommy here?

Jody, we're here because
we care about you.

What?

Your drinking is destroying your family!

It's not that kind of intervention.

Oh. Great.

- Intervention?
- Sit down, Jody.

I just dropped a dozen loads.
I need to get some ice.

Sit down. Sit. Sheila
has prepared some remarks.

I have.

"Jody, when you tried
to get me to be intimate

with three of your friends,

it made me feel sad and overextended.

Sex in a committed relationship

shouldn't involve sheets of plastic

and depriving a body
of oxygen."

Sheila, I'm--

"If you do not get the help you need,

you will force me to shut you
out of my life

and the life of my grandson Hymie,

who needs
a healthy environment."

- Sheils.
- Gotta go cold turkey.

- Can we talk about this?
- There's only one way.

Handcuff yourself and sweat it out.

Exhales Okay.

Not that easy.

- Need something from you.
- What?

Chips are earned through
blood, sweat, and tears.

When you've earned them,
you'll get 'em back.

Fair enough.

Over there.

I'm proud of you, Jody.

Thank you, Frank.

Atta boy!

Paramedics buying it?

We were gone for a few days.

We found her when we got back.

You're Patrick's cousin, right?

- You know Patrick?
- Play softball together.

He's, uh, he's a hell of a bat,

but he can barely make it
to first base without oxygen.

You are in a lot better shape.

Well, that's not saying much.

Cousin Patrick's like
a coronary waiting to happen.

Yeah.

Look, I know this isn't
exactly a great time,

but, uh, are you seeing anyone?

Can we talk about it
after I bury my aunt?

Right.
Sorry.

Um, I'll make sure to pass along
my condolences to Patrick.

Bottles clink

You're sure about this?

It's the only way we can keep
you from resisting your urges.

It's really hard.

I'll be with you the whole time.

No, I mean, it's really hard.

Handcuffs turn me on.

Gasp

Laughs

They don't give you extra credit
for showing up early.

- Where's your lawyer?
- In labor, crapping out a kid.

- Representing myself.
- Well, got some bad news.

Aunt Ginger passed away.
Yeah.

On the plus side, it turns out
she left me the house.

- What did you do?
- Only what I had to.

How about a thank you?

Now there's no danger
they'll haul you away

for social security fraud.

No more checks to cash, either.

Fuck you very much.

Always about the money, isn't it?

Work this out inside.
That's why we're here.

I'll see you in there.

- Fiona!
- Hey! I missed you so much!

Hiya! Hi!
Where's my little man? Hi!

- Hey, room for us in here?
- Hi.

- Get the will?
- Yeah, yeah, got it.

- Go file it now.
- Okay.

Frank!
Is it you?

Mom.

Oh!

Laughs

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm just pretty hungry.

- Would you make me something?
- Oh, my God.

Of course I'll make you something.

DFS. I'd like to
get it started here.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Britney Sturges,
Department of Family Services.

After receiving a report
about the Gallagher home,

I found the children under
Francis Gallagher's care

in a state of neglect.

We subsequently removed
the children from the home

for their own protection.

Mr. Gallagher,
you want the children back?

They're my kids, Your Honor.

The mother has relinquished
her parental rights.

What does that mean?

Monica doesn't want to be our mom?

She did it for you guys,
so I can bring you home.

And Ms. Gallagher
has filed a petition

to terminate the father's
parental rights.

Yes, Your Honor.

Are you prepared to assume custody?

I am.

I can provide a stable
environment for the kids,

something that has been
sorely lacking with our father.

I have a full-time job,
and I will soon own a home.

Hi, um, Cleopatra.
I'm here to file a will, please.

- Ginger Gallagher.
- Mm-hmm.

- Second one today.
- What?

Had another will filed earlier.

Um, how--
how is that possible?

Well, here's it, uh...

Dated last year.

- It supersedes yours.
- Who the hell filed it?

Patrick Gallagher.

- Cousin Patrick.
- She leave the house to him?

Thank you.

Next!

Eggs Benedict, coming up.

Mmm! Voila!

Uhh!
Laughs

- Toast and some fruit.
- Good.

Mmm!

I owe you an apology.

I never should have said those things.

I never should have made you choose.

Um...

Where is he?
My baby?

He's not living here right now.

Where is he?

He's with his daddy.

He's where he belongs for now,

and you're back where you belong.

I don't deserve him after what I did.

Don't say that.

I don't.

The best thing about mistakes is,

we get to correct them.

His name is Hiram,
and we call him Hymie,

and he is a beautiful,
wonderful baby boy.

Hymie.

Go on.
Eat it while it's hot.

Of course.
Thank you.

I love you.

Your brother Ian testified

about your father's
months-long absence.

Did his disappearance make you sad?

I don't know.

Were you glad when he came back?

He got me into camp.

- Camp?
- My first time.

Had a good time at camp?

Yeah.

Happy when he came back?

I guess.

What about you, Deborah?

Were you glad
when your father came back?

I was glad he wasn't dead.

Did you miss him while he was gone?

Uh, very much.

Did he get you into camp?

Mm-mm. I spent the summer
at the pool.

Daddy helped me learn.

How to swim?

Sort of.
It was a hard summer.

I wouldn't have
made it through without him.

Fiona helped me too.

Mr. Gallagher, you have
very special children.

That's why I had to leave, Your Honor.

I couldn't stand to see them

live through my battles
with addiction any longer.

It's my fight, not theirs.

- So, you left.
- To get help.

Sometimes the hardest part
is admitting you need it,

and I didn't want to come home
until I was clean and sober,

a father they could be proud of.

It isn't easy,

but every day I still have
one of these is a good day.

You're not buying this, are you?

- Ms. Gallagher.
- Have you seen his record?

Right here.

Breaking and entering,
drunk and disorderlies,

public urination,
solicitation, possession,

possession with intent,
domestic disturbance,

four DUIs, and you don't even own a car.

Alcohol is a cruel mistress.

He hasn't stopped drinking,
and he never will.

Your Honor, if I may?

Fiona has been hurt
by my behavior too many times

to believe I've changed.

That's my fault, not hers.

She has kept things going in my absence,

and I will be forever grateful.

I'm not the perfect parent.

I like to have a good time,
to live life to the fullest.

Sometimes I go too far.

But I love my kids.

They mean the world to me.

I don't know--
I don't know what I'd be

if I wasn't a dad.

I'd be nothing.

Please don't take my kids away from me.

Ms. Gallagher,
you want to tell me

why your father should be
declared unfit?

We were living out of a car once.

Uncle Nick had kicked us out.

We couldn't find anyone else
who'd take us in.

Lip and Ian and me
were sleeping in the backseat

when Frank pulled over.

Middle of the night.
Think it was Halstead.

Told me to take the boys
and sit on a curb,

and he'd be right back.

I was six.

Few hours later, we're still
sitting on the sidewalk,

and Ian's head is burning up.

He's hysterical.
I don't know what to do.

So I ran down the street,
Lip under one arm,

Ian under the other,
trying to flag down help.

It would have been easier scoring crack

than a ride to the clinic.

I finally made it on foot.

They said Ian had a fever of 104.

Another couple hours, who knows?

I didn't find Frank
till a couple days later.

First thing he asked me

was how much money I had on me.

I wish I could say
that was the only time,

but it was just the first.

My mother's bipolar

and my father's
an alcoholic and an addict.

He takes what he pleases
and he offers nothing.

No money, no support.

I've done what I could
to help raise my siblings.

I wish I could have done more.

I'm not asking for your pity

or your admiration.

I just want to be able
to give these kids

everything that they deserve,

because they're great kids
and they deserve better.

Chambers, please.

Gavel bangs

I know you didn't ask for it,
but you've got my admiration.

Your siblings are
very fortunate to have you.

I just want to bring 'em home.

Well, from all appearances,

your father's a pathological liar,

and it's just a matter of time
before he screws up again.

Now, it's my job to determine

what's in the best interest
of the children,

and I would rather not
leave them in his care,

but here's my problem.

Neglectful as he may be,

that's not enough to prove abuse.

So you're gonna let him keep
his rights to the kids?

I'm considering
appointing you the guardian,

which would give you legal rights

to make decisions about these kids.

As guardian, you'd have
a legal role in their lives

from here on.

- Okay.
- Hold on.

I said I was considering it.

Taking care of these kids
would be your life.

It already is.

And you're prepared to be
responsible for them

until they're 18?

You have one brother who's two.

That's 16 more years.

If that's what's in their best interest.

Well, what's in your best interest?

I have a daughter,

and when she was around your age,

she went to college.

She traveled across the country.

It was the best time of her life.

Now, if you decide to do this,

there's no changing your mind.

Your siblings come first,
even-- even if you decide

that you want your life back
at some point.

Even if you get married
and you and your husband

want to start a new family.

I appreciate how you feel
about these kids,

but I wouldn't want that
for my daughter.

We're talking about
the rest of your life.

Mr. Gallagher, you have admitted
it's been challenging

to handle this responsibility
on your own.

Now, if I allow you to retain
your parental rights,

would you consent to your daughter

becoming guardian to these children?

They'd still be my kids?

Provided you attend 60 days of AA.

But she'd have all the responsibility?

Not all, but yes.

Works for me.

Would you agree to be the guardian

of these children?

Yes, I do.

Well, that will be my order, then.

Take your children home.

So, where are the kids at, Frank?

Eh, fuck if I know.

I got Xbox!

- Who wants to hit the pool?
- Oh, me!

I got swim diapers.

Here's what you missed
on Shameless last time.

Not too much. It
was kind of light last week.

Jesus Christ!
I need you to do this!

I need you to get your shit
together and get the kids back.

No drugs, no booze.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

That's why the good lord
put me here--

so I can take in all his babies

don't nobody else want.

Rule number one. No sitting

We have filed the paperwork
to adopt Liam.

Oh, no, Liam.

Did you pee on the couch again
and the wall too?

How the hell are we gonna get that out?

Take it back to the hospital.
Somebody will want it.

I want it.

It's me or the baby.

What is that for?

Sex swing.

Oh, God.

It's good for us to grow.

No!

No, we're just taking fake
wedding pictures for the I.N.S.

I hate this I.N.S. bullshit.

Aw, shit.

What the fuck?

Get the fuck up!
Both groaning

No son of mine is gonna be
a goddamn AIDS monkey.

Who reported us?

I would like to report
a negligence situation.

Six kids living in squalor,
no parental supervision.

If it's all right, I would like
to remain anonymous.

- Please, Mr. Redel.
- You can't afford me.

so I can get them home,

and you're not going anywhere
until you tell me how to do it.

You know, the firm makes me do
one pro Bono case a year,

and I guess this won't be
as bad as representing

those scary motherfuckers
at the innocence project.

What do I have to do?

Get your parents
to terminate their rights

and prove you can provide
a stable environment.

Get W-2s to show
you've got a full-time job.

You got a place for the kids to live?

Uh-huh.

Bullshit!

30 days? Frank hasn't been
sober for 30 minutes.

Mind your own business.

I can smell the booze from here.

- Just give me the chip.
- Don't do it!

Just let me borrow it.

You've got to earn the chip
like we all did,

through blood, sweat, and tears.

Only requirement for membership

is the desire to stop drinking.

Exactly.

If I'm tempted by the bottle,

I can look to the chip
for encouragement.

Pay it forward, Nance.

This meeting is for people

who have changed their lives
for the better, Frank.

Come on.

Can't do it.

For the better?

You're all dying
a slow, miserable death,

thanks to this cult
of self-improvement.

Drop off the kids,
9:00 to 5:00, PTA, AA.

You call that a life?
This ain't North Korea.

- Alcohol is a gift.
- It's time to go!

Nance, what happened to you?

You used to dance on tables!

Now it's cleaning your dad's catheter

and the graveyard shift
at the drugstore!

You're young!
Don't pack it in!

All right.
All right, slow down.

- I need to make a will.
- What?

I could probably download one
from the Internet.

- All right. For who?
- Aunt Ginger.

I gotta finally make it official.

I'm getting the house.

And I need a W-2
to show I have a job.

It doesn't matter

if you can't get Monica
to sign away her rights.

I don't need her to sign.

I was forging doctor's notes
in first grade.

Hey.

Hey, I thought I heard the door.

They let you out of the group home?

Oh, yeah.
They cut us loose from dawn till dusk.

I found them.

I'm going to visit Carl and Liam.

He asked for M-80s,
Nintendo DS,

and ninja throwing stars.

- Could use your help.
- How?

I'm getting custody.

Of us?

It's the only way to bring everyone home

and keep it that way.

Timmy is the father!
The father gets the baby!

It's the law!

Tell them, you never
give up your rights!

Well, we got rights too, lady!

If we want to get rid
of a kid, we stay in China!

Show me the baby!

Don't you do it.

- She is his grandmother.
- So are you.

- Please.
- Okay, okay.

Crying

What's wrong?
You break him?

- He's got Down's Syndrome.
- We fix him.

- Fix him?
- Fix the baby.

Traditional Chinese medicine.

Special herbs from Guangxi
province. Good as new.

You can't fix Down's Syndrome.
It's an extra chromosome.

We have an herb for chromosome.

Have an herb for everything.
Chromosome goes away.

Isn't that right, beautiful boy?

- What's this?
- Nothing. It's for the dog.

Here. Sparky!
Whistles

Can I hold him?

Oh!

Where's the mother?
Father is here.

Baby needs a father.
We have a big family.

Many little cousins to play with.

What's taking so long?

You don't have to do this.

Custody.
It's a big responsibility.

Lip'll help.
And Ian.

It's permanent.

Exactly. Frank permanently
out of our lives.

Doing Kev's taxes
every year since I was ten

is finally gonna pay off.

You just gotta scan the W-2
and change the name.

Yeah, it's so easy,

it's like they're daring you
to commit fraud.

I don't want to get Kev in trouble.

- Yo, Kev?
- Hey, need a refill?

No. Is it cool if we put
Fiona's name on your W-2?

- Sure. What's a W-2?
- Hmm?

Look, even if he gets pinched, right?

The feds'll figure out pretty quickly

he can't do his own taxes,
let alone fake someone else's.

Anything else?

Yeah. I need you
to get a will notarized.

- A will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

Good news. She died.
We're getting the house.

Will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah. We're gonna
need a body, too.

Uh, where are you gonna get a dead body?

Ringtone

- Sorry to bail. It's my mom.
- Everything okay?

Uh, yeah, it's just divorce

plus copious amounts of chardonnay

equals expensive accidents.

I'll call you later, okay?

Bacardi, and leave the bottle.

Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

Estefania texted 911.
Immigration's at her house.

Told me they were coming tomorrow, man!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Open the door!

Aw, man, what the fuck are you watching?

Cartoons, man.

- Roadrunner is funny as shit.
- Jesus Christ.

Three bracelets and one necklace.

Enough for chicken rings.

- Just two?
- Two earrings.

- Four earrings.
- Two pairs.

Earrings come in pairs.

God helps those who help themselves.

You want 'em or not?

- Sorry to keep you waiting.

Wilton. Steve Wilton.
Estefania's husband. Hi.

Ah.
What are we doing?

Dog barking in distance

- Hey, need a favor.
- Uh-oh.

That's how I started the talk
with my mom.

I hope you're not asking me
to mount your man.

Those geriatrics at the nursing home

drop like flies, right?

Thought it would be,
"Wham, bam, thank you, mom,"

but Kev's sperm
were as gun-shy as he was.

Bought an ovulation calendar.
Have to track her damn cycle.

- You're going again?
- What choice do I have?

At least this way,
I'll know when she's fertile.

I don't want Kevin fucking
my mom any more than he has to.

So, you must lose

a couple of those seniors
at the home a week, right?

More when Bernice is working.

That negligent bitch is like
the grim fucking reaper. Why?

I need a body.
To get the kids back.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

Thanks.
Knew I could count on you.

Father Pete.
Just who I was looking for.

The silver's locked up, Frank.

Laughs

You always had a great
sense of humor, padre.

There's not enough laughs
in religion these days.

Too much fire and brimstone.

- It turns the kids off.
- Got a sermon to write.

While you're putting pen to paper,

how about dashing off
a letter for yours truly?

Kids got taken away again?

Superlatives appreciated.

I wrote you character
references the last two times,

and you're still a deadbeat.

I've turned over a new leaf.

You're the reason we had to
install security cameras.

- Close the door on your way out.
- So that's it?

You're turning away sinners
who are looking for forgiveness?

This-- this is why white kids
are flocking to Allah.

We are in a war for hearts and minds,

and you are shipping American youth

to terror camps in Pakistan.

This is what happens

when you put a German
in charge of the church.

You're not leaving, are you?

You could just reprint

the one you did last time.

Then you'll get the hell out?

Use parish letterhead.

And if he gets a diaper rash,
try the Desitin.

And, um, at night,
sing him Song Sung Blue.

- Song Sung...
- Yeah, he loves Neil Diamond.

I put the words in the diaper bag.

And tickle him.
Don't forget to tickle him.

He loves that,
especially under the armpit.

He laughs so hard.

Are you sure this is what you want?

He should know his dad.
Yeah.

This way, he'll get to be with everyone,

just like a timeshare.

Yeah.
I love you so much, Hymie.

Okay.

Come tomorrow.
Tickle him.

I will.

And we'll see you weekends and holidays.

Don't forget Neil Diamond!

Car door shuts Sweet Caroline...

Car starts

And Cracklin' Rosie get on board!

He loves Neil diamond.

Car door shuts

Sniffles

It's the right thing to do.

Can't see how.
I miss him already.

You want to go upstairs?

Babe?

I should get back to Fiona.

Immigration is getting suspicious.

Not my fault.

How much money do you have
in this account, exactly?

Gas bill.

You're going to be here now
mornings and nights, yes?

In case Immigration makes
another surprise visit?

Yeah, absolutely.
Wouldn't miss it.

- Other than tomorrow.
- Speaking foreign language

Uh, my girlfriend's trying
to adopt her siblings.

The court hearing's tomorrow.

You know, didn't even ask me.
Just assumed I'd be on board.

And why would she ask you?

It's not only her decision.
It affects me too.

You always take care of your family.

Yeah, well, I didn't exactly
sign up for that.

She is too good for you.
Cable.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big. Just some
"walking around" money.

Just a couple grand.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

My parents' money is
tied up in their divorce,

and I'm gonna need some cash

if I'm supporting a whole family now.

You always take care of your family.

You take care of them, not Nando.

There was an old lady
who lived in a shoe.

She's 22.

Had so many kids,
she didn't know what to do.

What difference does it make?
She's been doing the job for years.

- You cool with it?
- Whatever it takes. You?

As long as I don't have to
call her "mom."

- Oh, sh--
- Guess who?

Jimmy's dad?

Hey, you seen Mickey around?

He's been missing.
He owes me 50 bucks.

- He'll be on his feet soon.
- What happened?

- My dad pistol-whipped him.
- Why?

Since when does anyone need
a reason to pistol-whip Mickey?

- Have you signed up yet?
- What for?

S.A.T. The deadline's
tomorrow. I told you.

I'll do it online.
It takes two seconds.

Yeah, you said you'd graduate too,

and you're on your what,
fourth semester of senior year?

My third.
Only two courses left.

All right.
So, where are we going?

Uh, drew up a will.
We need it notarized.

- Ginger Gallagher?
- It's a long story.

Well, it looks like
you wrote down the wrong year.

Uh, no, that's the right year.

What, 2006?

You're taking the S.A.T.?

Not unless someone's paying me.

- Hey.
- You must be Sheila.

Yes?

Jody's told us so much about you.

- Oh.
- Hey.

Hi. Are you
friends of Jody's?

Oh, it was so good to get his call.

Hadn't heard from him in a while.

- Outlet?
- Um, it's around the corner.

- Where do you want the plastic?
- Plastic?

Yeah, the carpet looks nice.
Wouldn't want to ruin it.

Oh, um, let me-- Jody?

Did Jody hire you guys
to work on the house?

Yo, Shawn, this enough lube?

Made a Costco run.
Got another in the car.

Should last us for round one, right?

Jody!

What's up, fellas?
You stretch yet, old man?

Yeah, yeah. Where do you
want the Gatorade?

- Uh, the fridge is fine.
- Can I, um, talk to you?

- You meet the guys?
- Yeah, I-I did.

I'll be right back.
Ow. What's-- what's wrong?

- Get them out of here!
- Why?

- I thought you'd be into it.
- Are you nuts?

I figured it'd get your mind off stuff.

I was right to have Hymie
go with the Wongs!

What?

This is not a healthy
environment for a child.

You mean I'm the reason he's gone?

Clears throat

So is-- is this gonna
happen or what?

I gotta pick up my daughter
from ballet in an hour.

- No! It is not!
- Yes! Yes, it is!

- Somewhere else.
- Don't sweat it.

I got an eVite to a bukkake
party on the West Side.

Sweet. All right, guys.
Let's get out of here.

Jody?
Jody.

Dog barking in distance

Hey, thanks for getting the deadbolt.

- Hey.
- How's your mom?

- Just needed a little TLC.
- I need to find Frank.

- Oh, he's upstairs.
- You let him in?

No, he was already raiding
the fridge when I got here.

You seen my suit?

I'm gonna take the kids off your hands.

All you gotta do is sign a form.

Can't find anything
in this goddamn house.

Did you hear me?
I want the kids.

If you want a kid so bad,
toss your birth control pills.

I want you to give up
your parental rights.

I'm serious. Look.
I already got Monica to sign.

You'd have to find her first.

- Where is she?
- Not telling you.

She's my wife.

If she wanted you to know where she is,

she would have told you herself.

Now, you gonna sign the form?

- No!
- She did.

- She would never do that.
- I got a witness.

It's not like you want your kids anyway.

They're my kids!

You're the one who called DFS on 'em

to have them taken away!

- Bullshit!
- I heard the tape.

I never fucking called anybody.

Of course you don't remember.
You're drunk all the time.

Just tell me what it's gonna take.

What? Suddenly, you give
a shit about your kids?

You don't want to sign, fine.

I'll have you declared unfit.
I already got a lawyer.

- I'm getting the kids.
- You're not taking my kids!

It's Veronica. Says
she's got a dead body for you.

- All right.
- Hey, V.

Groans I'm hungry.

Make more earrings.
They're easier.

Gotta escape.
Get food.

Mama Kamala sees everything.

Could attack her with scissors.

That's like going after
a rhino with a butter knife.

Oh, you call that a cross?

Give me the damn Krazy Glue, Carley.

Give me your Benadryl.

Now, this is a cross Jesus
would be proud to be nailed to.

You want to play with this?
All right.

Hey, careful with those throwing stars.

They could pierce a jugular.

- You gotta get me out of here.
- Why?

They took my rifle,

they make me brush my teeth
after every meal,

they're always around,
seeing if I'm okay.

Do you mean they're
trying to be good parents?

Uh, don't forget, Carl.
Church in ten minutes.

Text alert

Shit.

That's Fiona.
I gotta go meet her.

But, hey, um, see if you can get

the security codes for this place.

We'll come back in a couple months

and steal a bunch of this shit,
all right?

Hang in there.

Come on, Mandy, we gotta go.

See you, buddy.

Bye.

Where's the kid?

His grandmother.

- You let her take him?
- Not forever.

But this is not a healthy

Jody is out of control,

and he told me this would happen,

and I just pushed him
and pushed him and--

I'm gonna miss
that little half-wit.

I'm just packing up
some of his favorite toys.

Made in China, just like him.

No wonder he likes 'em so much.

Must be a sense memory thing
with the lead paint.

Don't let the kid go.
Fight for him.

How?

I can't have a child here
with Jody's problem.

He just won't even listen.

Well, don't take no for an answer.

We could help him see.

Laughs We?

- An intervention.
- Whoa! No, no, no, no, no.

- Yeah.
- Interventions aren't my thing.

- Oh, Frank! Please.
- My libertarian leanings.

It's not that kind of intervention.

Oh. Great.

- Intervention?
- Sit down, Jody.

I just dropped a dozen loads.
I need to get some ice.

Sit down. Sit. Sheila
has prepared some remarks.

I have.

"Jody, when you tried
to get me to be intimate

with three of your friends,

it made me feel sad and overextended.

Sex in a committed relationship

shouldn't involve sheets of plastic

and depriving a body
of oxygen."

Sheila, I'm--

"If you do not get the help you need,

you will force me to shut you
out of my life

and the life of my grandson Hymie,

who needs
a healthy environment."

- Sheils.
- Gotta go cold turkey.

- Can we talk about this?
- There's only one way.

Not that easy.

- Need something from you.

Well, that's not saying much.

Cousin Patrick's like

Look, I know this isn't

she left me the house.

Britney Sturges,
Department of Family Services.

After receiving a report
about the Gallagher home,

I found the children under
Francis Gallagher's care

in a state of neglect.

We subsequently removed
the children from the home

for their own protection.

Mr. Gallagher,
you want the children back?

They're my kids, Your Honor.

The mother has relinquished
her parental rights.

What does that mean?

Monica doesn't want to be our mom?

She did it for you guys,
so I can bring you home.

And Ms. Gallagher
has filed a petition

to terminate the father's
parental rights.

Yes, Your Honor.

Are you prepared to assume custody?

I am.

I can provide a stable
environment for the kids,

something that has been
sorely lacking with our father.

I have a full-time job,
and I will soon own a home.

Hi, um, Cleopatra.
I'm here to file a will, please.

- Ginger Gallagher.
- Mm-hmm.

- Second one today.
- What?

Had another will filed earlier.

Um, how--
how is that possible?

Well, here's it, uh...

Dated last year.

- It supersedes yours.
- Who the hell filed it?

Patrick Gallagher.

- Cousin Patrick.
- She leave the house to him?

Thank you.

Next!

Eggs Benedict, coming up.

Mmm! Voila!

Uhh!
Laughs

- Toast and some fruit.
- Good.

Mmm!

I owe you an apology.

I never should have said those things.

I never should have made you choose.

Um...

Where is he?
My baby?

He's not living here right now.

Where is he?

He's with his daddy.

He's where he belongs for now,

and you're back where you belong.

I don't deserve him after what I did.

Don't say that.

I don't.

The best thing about mistakes is,

we get to correct them.

His name is Hiram,
and we call him Hymie,

and he is a beautiful,
wonderful baby boy.

Hymie.

Go on.
Eat it while it's hot.

Of course.
Thank you.

I love you.

Your brother Ian testified

about your father's
months-long absence.

Did his disappearance make you sad?

I don't know.

Were you glad when he came back?

He got me into camp.

- Camp?
- My first time.

Had a good time at camp?

Yeah.

Happy when he came back?

I guess.

What about you, Deborah?

Were you glad
when your father came back?

I was glad he wasn't dead.

Did you miss him while he was gone?

Uh, very much.

Did he get you into camp?

Mm-mm. I spent the summer
at the pool.

Daddy helped me learn.

How to swim?

Sort of.
It was a hard summer.

I wouldn't have
made it through without him.

Fiona helped me too.

Mr. Gallagher, you have
very special children.

That's why I had to leave, Your Honor.

I couldn't stand to see them

live through my battles
with addiction any longer.

It's my fight, not theirs.

- So, you left.
- To get help.

Sometimes the hardest part
is admitting you need it,

and I didn't want to come home
until I was clean and sober,

a father they could be proud of.

It isn't easy,

but every day I still have
one of these is a good day.

You're not buying this, are you?

- Ms. Gallagher.
- Have you seen his record?

Right here.

Breaking and entering,
drunk and disorderlies,

public urination,
solicitation, possession,

possession with intent,
domestic disturbance,

four DUIs, and you don't even own a car.

Alcohol is a cruel mistress.

He hasn't stopped drinking,
and he never will.

Your Honor, if I may?

Fiona has been hurt
by my behavior too many times

to believe I've changed.

That's my fault, not hers.

She has kept things going in my absence,

and I will be forever grateful.

I'm not the perfect parent.

I like to have a good time,
to live life to the fullest.

Sometimes I go too far.

But I love my kids.

They mean the world to me.

I don't know--
I don't know what I'd be

if I wasn't a dad.

I'd be nothing.

Please don't take my kids away from me.

Ms. Gallagher,
you want to tell me

why your father should be
declared unfit?

We were living out of a car once.

Uncle Nick had kicked us out.

We couldn't find anyone else
who'd take us in.

Lip and Ian and me
were sleeping in the backseat

when Frank pulled over.

Middle of the night.
Think it was Halstead.

Told me to take the boys
and sit on a curb,

and he'd be right back.

I was six.

Few hours later, we're still
sitting on the sidewalk,

and Ian's head is burning up.

He's hysterical.
I don't know what to do.

So I ran down the street,
Lip under one arm,

Ian under the other,
trying to flag down help.

It would have been easier scoring crack

than a ride to the clinic.

I finally made it on foot.

They said Ian had a fever of 104.

Another couple hours, who knows?

I didn't find Frank
till a couple days later.

First thing he asked me

was how much money I had on me.

I wish I could say
that was the only time,

but it was just the first.

My mother's bipolar

and my father's
an alcoholic and an addict.

He takes what he pleases
and he offers nothing.

No money, no support.

I've done what I could
to help raise my siblings.

I wish I could have done more.

I'm not asking for your pity

or your admiration.

I just want to be able
to give these kids

everything that they deserve,

because they're great kids
and they deserve better.

Chambers, please.

Gavel bangs

I know you didn't ask for it,
but you've got my admiration.

Your siblings are
very fortunate to have you.

I just want to bring 'em home.

Well, from all appearances,

your father's a pathological liar,

and it's just a matter of time
before he screws up again.

Now, it's my job to determine

what's in the best interest
of the children,

and I would rather not
leave them in his care,

but here's my problem.

Neglectful as he may be,

that's not enough to prove abuse.

So you're gonna let him keep
his rights to the kids?

I'm considering
appointing you the guardian,

which would give you legal rights

to make decisions about these kids.

As guardian, you'd have
a legal role in their lives

from here on.

- Okay.
- Hold on.

I said I was considering it.

Taking care of these kids
would be your life.

It already is.

And you're prepared to be
responsible for them

until they're 18?

You have one brother who's two.

That's 16 more years.

If that's what's in their best interest.

Well, what's in your best interest?

I have a daughter,

and when she was around your age,

she went to college.

She traveled across the country.

It was the best time of her life.

Now, if you decide to do this,

there's no changing your mind.

Your siblings come first,
even-- even if you decide

that you want your life back
at some point.

Even if you get married
and you and your husband

want to start a new family.

I appreciate how you feel
about these kids,

but I wouldn't want that
for my daughter.

We're talking about
the rest of your life.

Mr. Gallagher, you have admitted
it's been challenging

to handle this responsibility
on your own.

Now, if I allow you to retain
your parental rights,

would you consent to your daughter

becoming guardian to these children?

They'd still be my kids?

Provided you attend 60 days of AA.

But she'd have all the responsibility?

Not all, but yes.

Works for me.

Would you agree to be the guardian

of these children?

Yes, I do.

Well, that will be my order, then.

Take your children home.

- Not live.

you could use some help.

You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I got to hit the Alibi
in ten minutes anyway.

- I'm good to stay.
- Please just go home

to your own

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big,

- Mom.
- Oh!

Where is he, my baby?

He's where
he belongs for now,

and you're back
where you belong.

Now, if I allow you
to retain your parental rights,

would you consent to
your daughter becoming guardian?

Works for me.

Would you agree to be
the guardian of these children?

Yes, I do.

in honor of Aunt Ginger.

"GG" as I called her.

You now, when the guy
at the funeral place

handed me her ashes,
I thought,

what the hell
do I do with these?

Put 'em in a vase
on my mantle?

Or scatter them
at the park or the lake?

Then I thought, no,

I know where
she was happiest.

On this corner,
her corner,

where she turned tricks
in her 20s and 30s.

And 60s!

- She did magic tricks?
- No, no, no, son.

"Turning tricks" is
a euphemism for prostitution.

In her day, your great aunt was
a legendary pole smoker.

Could unlock her jaw
like a Burmese python.

We are at her funeral.

You know,
some think Gallaghers

don't have a work ethic,

but Ginger worked this corner
rain, sleet, snow,

her old knees hitting
that hard pavement

again and again.

Bertie Giddelman is the only one
that's outlasted her.

Look, you all knew Ginger,
so I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

She was a mean old bitch.

But even a mean old bitch
deserves a send off.

Here, here.

So this is us, Ginger,

sending you off,
right where you belong.

It's touching.

I'm tearing up.

Okay, kids, let's go.

Patrick.

So Ginger had a will
that we didn't know about,

and you just had it sitting
in a drawer?

Yep.

And even though
she hated your guts,

she left our house to you?

It was never your house.

It's weird, you know,

how she signed the will
only a year ago,

you know, her being
an invalid and all.

Signed and notarized.

I don't remember you
coming by with a lawyer.

I gotta get back
to my family.

Six kids
with nowhere else to go.

Why don't
we talk about this

when the sting of losing Ginger
has worn off, hmm?

Tomorrow, maybe?

You want to tell them
or should I?

V, your mom's here.

Ooh.
You look really nice, Carol.

- Thank you, honey.
- You do look nice.

- Where'd you get that dress?
- Madison's.

And those shoes.

You doing something
at church later?

I'm ovulating again.

Ovulating?

No, it's not until next week.
I got the calendar.

High body temperature,
sore breasts,

increased cervical mucus.

We believe you, mama.

Well, if you all want
to try again,

we have a four-day window.

Guess no need to waste
an opportunity, right, baby?

What, you wanna do this
right now?

Like, right now?

Well, I can come back.

No, no need.

I'm like a stud bull.

You open the barn door,
slap me on the ass.

You know, I mean, when I say,
"open the barn door,"

I don't mean your, um--

uh, do you guys
want a drink?

I'll get three glasses.

Are you sure you just want
to jump into this?

You don't want a minute
to think?

Waiting isn't gonna
make it easier.

All right, I'm gonna
block everything out,

and I'm just gonna picture
your beautiful face.

- I picture Denzel Washington.
- Oh, for real?

When I open my eyes a little
and I see it's a white guy,

eh, then I go
with Johnny Depp.

Oh?

You appreciate the irony,
right?

Senseless arguments about
who gets what bedroom,

refusing to allow me to stay.

- Now, nobody gets to stay.
- Why is Frank here again?

There's a small chance
he'll be able to help

since he's known Patrick
longer than any of us.

Patrick wants
to steal our house?

He's a contractor.
He's gonna flip it.

Slap a coat of paint on it,

call it
"a cozy, authentic pre-war,"

and offload it to yuppies.

Not gonna happen.

- So let's go over our options.
- I'll write them down.

All right, look, we know
the will is bullshit.

It was signed a year ago,

and Ginger's
been dead for what, 10?

More like 15.

Option one.
Prove will is a forgery.

We can't call the cops
because we faked Ginger's death

and forged a will of our own.

Plus Frank's been cashing
Ginger's social security checks.

Oh, like you didn't share
in that bounty?

What we could do,
we could argue

that Ginger wasn't of
sound mind when she signed it.

I mean, she was
never of sound mind anyway.

Option two.
Say Ginger was crazy.

Or convince Patrick
to back off somehow.

Yeah, that's three.

Good luck with that!

His nickname
used to be Pit Bull.

It was partly an odor thing,

but also because once he gets
ahold of you, he doesn't let go.

You gotta kill him first.

Option four. Kill Patrick.

It's time to face reality.

Patrick out-Gallaghered us,

and there's no point
in fighting it.

Easy for you to say,
you're at Sheila's.

So before you're out
on the streets

like so many Somalian refugees,
ask yourselves,

"if Patrick
is taking the house,

what are we taking?"

Copper pipes.

You're not taking the pipes,
Frank.

You really think there's
a way to challenge the will?

Why not? You know,
if I can bone up on probate law.

All in favor.

Unanimous.

Well, like hell it is.

Lip will handle the will.

The rest of you,

get ready for the first day
of school tomorrow.

Debbie and Carl,
pick out something to wear

that doesn't have holes.

Wouldn't it just be easier
to kill him?

Clothes, now.

We better work fast.

Winter's coming, and it'll
be cold sleeping in the park.

This is why democracy
does not work.

Time to get out
the "help wanted" ads.

- How you holding up?
- You know what I want?

Not to win the lottery or
go on vacation to the Caribbean.

I want normal people problems.

Like,
am I getting enough fiber?

Why did my friend
say that insensitive thing

about my weight?

Well, it'll work out,
it always does.

You realize only rich people
say shit like that.

What's that
supposed to mean?

That we have no backup plan.

There's no running
to mom and dad.

And that's what I do?

I'm saying neither one of us
has a job.

One week with me
as their guardian, one,

they're about to be homeless.

Then we'll get jobs.

I mean, the Gallaghers
are survivors, right?

We can do this.

We?

You, me, we.

Since when
are you a lawyer?

Since never,

which is why I have to read up
on this shit.

How 'bout
I give you a hummer,

help you relax?

I don't think that's
gonna help my productivity.

You can multitask.

 Said I find it hard



Would you, uh...

would you be offended
if I kept working?

Knock at door

Lip, can we talk?

Yeah, if you can talk
from out there.

It's private.

This better be good.



 sometimes we know

 but sometimes

 oh baby sometimes

 you gotta get
what you need



I rang the doorbell,

but Ian had me wait out here.

I don't think
he likes me anymore.

I don't think
he ever liked you.

I got your message.

Right, the one where I told
you to go fuck yourself?

It was nice
to hear your voice.

Eiffel Tower?

Yeah, this guy said
he'd take me to Paris,

so I had this done.

But he took all my money

and tried to sell me
to a sheikh from Yemen.

So, yeah, things got bad
for a little while.

But anyways,

I'm-- I'm home now.

That sounds shitty.

Is Mandy inside?

Yeah.

So that's why Ian
had me wait out here?

That'd be my guess.

Are you happy?

Sure.

Well, good, because
I want you to be happy.

You deserve it.

Well, I--

I better get back.

You look good.

Welcome back.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- You have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.

Well, here's a good one.

Barista at the coffee beanery.

Shelly Espinosa works there,
makes like 20 grand.

A month?
A year?

Shit.
How do people live on that?

So the cleaning posse guys
called back.

An effluent tank overflowed
at the slaughterhouse.

They can use us both.
$14.50 an hour.

- A what tank?
- Effluent.

See, I told you
it would work out.

It's so exciting having you
back in your old room.

I just wish I had seen
Hymie in his crib.

Well, Mrs. Wong
can bring Hymie by anytime.

How is he?

He's wonderful.

Oh my gosh,
he is such a sweet boy.

And now that you're home,
I'm sure the Wongs

will let us spend more time
with him.

I'm not sure I'm ready
for that yet.

I know you want to be
involved in Hymie's life.

In fact, I found a flyer
for a support group.

Support for what?

For families affected
with Down's Syndrome.

I thought it might be a way
for us to educate ourselves

about Hymie's needs.

Be grateful
the kid's not here.

Butt out, Frank!

Children in the Cambodian
killing fields

turned their parents
over for execution.

A lifetime of devotion,
that's the loyalty it buys you.

Who wants lasagna?

Oh, Karen,
please put your pants on.

What?
It's not like I'm naked.

I'm in recovery.
I'm hypersensitive.

That's a good idea.

Jody, there's only three
plates here.

You might want to get one
for Karen.

Mouthing silently

I'm gonna go make a salad.

Oh, great.

Um...

Frank.

Uh-huh?

Honey, we've been through
a lot together.

That we have, Sheils,
that we have.

Um, but Hymie's gone,

and with Karen and Jody here,
it's kind of a full house.

What?

No.
No, no, no, don't say that.

Frank, I'm just asking you
to go home to your family.

My family threw me out with
no regard for my well-being.

Do you want me homeless?

Do you want me
wandering the streets

just as old man winter
winds his way down

from the frozen north?

Don't you have someone you can
stay with, like a friend?

Just as I'm getting
my life together.

I'm going to AA.

You go because
a judge ordered you to go.

Sheila.

Frank, you're a good man,

but you've got to find
another place to stay.

Jesus, Carl,
there's enough to go around.

Would you grab the paper bags?

If we have to move,
where do we go?

We're not moving.

How's it going
with Ginger's will?

Working on it.

V, thanks for
taking Liam today.

I pretend he's
my little black baby,

and when he's cranky and smelly,
I get to bring him back.

Where is Liam?

Trying out
the big boy toilet.

And you left him there?

Debbie, that is not
the outfit that we picked out

for your first day, and you are
so not leaving here in that.

- I borrowed it from Mandy.
- Clearly.

You do realize that
I'm in middle school now, right?

Yeah, not stripper school.
Go change.

Knocking at door
Somebody get that.

Mandy, she's 13.

She's not working the bedroom
at the Mustang Ranch.

Yeah, like you never wore
a short skirt

when you were her age.

Jeez, Fi,
she's just trying to help.

Knocking at door
I'll get it.

Can you take
Liam tomorrow too?

Not sure yet.

Those fruits of Islam people
on 4th have a free daycare.

If I say I hate whitey,

I bet they'll watch him
for a few hours.

So is Lip getting serious
about Mandy "Skankovich"?

Nice.

Oh, shit, Mandy, I'm sorry.

You know I would have never
said that to your face.

Should I apologize or leave?

I'm gonna leave.

You and I both know you're not
legally entitled to shit.

Patrick?

You remember my sons,
Desmond and Warren.

What are you doing here?

Oh, just a quick walkthrough
to assess repairs,

shouldn't take too long.

It'd be quicker
if you just left.

You're the ones
that are gonna be leaving.

Assuming your bullshit will
stands up in court.

Probate hearing
is on Thursday.

This Thursday?

Uh-huh.
Why prolong the inevitable?

I'm gonna need you
out on Saturday

so I can spray the place
with insecticide,

rip up this piss carpet,

and, you know,
make it livable.

Boys, start upstairs.

We've got kids
living here,

and you're just gonna
throw us out?

How do you sleep at night?

Don't blame your miserable
goddamn lives on me.

Indistinct chatter

Okay, listen up.

Some of you have inquired
about our petition.

We have demanded that
Lincoln Grove high school

offer programs
for special students

to help them fit in
with their classmates.

Applause

- Aren't you glad we came?
- Yeah.

Great, also concerning
the "R" word,

we have demanded
a school policy

forbidding students and faculty
from using that word.

- Retard.
- Excuse me.

Retard.
You can't even say it.

So how do we talk about it?

We all know your opinion
on this, Jeremy.

But right now
I'm the one speaking.

Brothers and sisters,

words only have power
if we give them power.

We must take back
the word "retard."

Make it ours.

Sweetheart, the rest of us
find the word offensive.

I'm not your sweetheart,
bitch.

All gasp

Mrs. Kandage,
I know you mean well,

but many of us here
think it's time

that we reclaim
and redefine the word.

And since normies
don't get called "retard,"

they don't have
a say in this.

Normies do not get a say.

What's a "normie?"

I think it's slang
for non-retards.

- Hey, Fabio, do you mind?
- Sorry.

I don't care how it's used.

I don't want anybody calling
my son that word ever.

It's incredibly hurtful.

Even if we did get rid of it,

someone will just think up
another way of saying it.

That's right.
The queers took back their word.

- It's different.
- How is it different?

It's not like
race issues disappear

if people stop saying nigger.

Shut the fuck up!

I can say it, you can't.

Retards,
we must ban together.

The way to get respect
is to take respect,

and normies can help us
get that message out.

Raise your hand
if you're with us!

Yeah.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

All: Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

You digging that smell?

Did something die in here?

A couple thousand somethings.

- It gets better after awhile.
- How?

Your brain
sort of short-circuits,

shuts off your sense of smell.

Tape everything up,
gloves and boots.

We got solids in there today.

Solids?

Maggots, roaches,
rats, flies.

You got roaches
inside your suit

going crazy, running all over
your short hairs,

hard to focus on work.

Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God.

Keep your mouth shut,
and I don't mean shut up.

I mean, don't let anything
splash in your mouth.

Your girlfriend
gonna be okay?

Thank you, everyone,
for sharing.

Have a good day.

Groans

Great meeting.

I just need to get
my slip signed for the court.

Okay.

Let's see.

I guess we'll see you twice
a week for at least six months.

Keep coming back, Frank.

As if I had a fucking choice.

- Congratulations.
- What?

I said congratulations.

During group share you said
you're two years sober,

unless I misunderstood.

No, that's right.
Two years today.

Oh, only six weeks for me.

It hasn't been easy.

I was downing
cleaning products, mouthwash.

- You ever try Sterno?
- Love Sterno.

It's ridiculous
what passes for alcoholism

with this group.

Her two-hour blackout?

I mean, come on.

I blacked out a year.

Am I whining about it?

Or the guy that lost his job
and banged his sister-in-law?

Where I come from,
that's Friday night.

Both chuckle

But you've been sober
two years.

That's amazing.

But it's because
you don't need booze

to fill the gaping hole
in your life.

It's about being
in the moment.

A meatball sub.

A Bears game
on the television.

Simple pleasures.

Simple pleasures, right.

Frank,
I'm Chris or Christopher.

I hope you don't mind
if I ask.

Would you be my sponsor?

- Would I--
- Sponsor me in the program.

My previous sponsor moved out
and went to Leesburg.

That's in Florida.

Right, right.
But here's the thing.

Much as I'd love to help,

and inspiring
as I would no doubt be,

your best sponsor
is yourself.

I understand.

Take care.

Wait.

You said your last sponsor
moved out.

What, he--
what, he lived with you?

- Yeah.
- In a house?

You live in a house,
an apartment, what?

A house.

I'm sorry, let me
introduce myself properly.

I'm Frank Gallagher.

Tell me your name again.

It's Chris or Christopher.

Christopher, right.

Gags

I'm getting out.

I'm getting out.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry, but no one speaking
English as a first language

should be doing this job.

The money's good.

Not that good.

So much for
"you, me, we."

I can feel cockroaches
under my suit.

On my back!
Hit me on my back!

Hit me on my-- fuck.

Oh.

Oh, hey, these candles
are a nice idea.

- Mom brought 'em.
- Oh, she did?

Just look at me.

That's it.

Oh, shit.

You're a stud bull,
aren't you, baby?

Oh, yeah.

Hold that thought.
Mom!

Jump in between us.
Hurry up.

Wasn't sure
when to bring this up,

but maybe I could use
a little warm-up this time.

Warming up,
like a jog around the block?

'Cause if you're asking Kev
to go down on you,

I can tell you right now
that is not happening.

Women are more likely to
conceive if they have an orgasm.

I read it in Cosmo.

It pulls the sperm up into--

The conversation is
not happening on this end,

just saying.

- Hey, sorry I bailed.
- Don't be sorry.

I'm sure tons of guys would
leave their girlfriends alone

to shovel blood and shit.

I went down to the coffee
beanery and got a job.

How much per hour?

I mean, you know, not
as much as the cleaning posse,

but all the coffee
you can drink.

- Full-time?
- Close.

- How close?
- Part-time.

There are opportunities
for advancement.

The manager was saying--

We've reconvened
the Cousin Patrick war council.

No luck on the legal front?

No, it turns out
it's pretty hard to prove

that someone had dementia
when they signed a will.

In our case,
very fucking hard.

Because she was already dead.

- What was option two again?
- We're on three now.

Convince Patrick to back off.

Or option four,
kill Patrick.

Back to three.
Convince him how?

We get my brothers to go
around and scare him a little.

No way.

Enough with
the brothers Milkovich.

Nothing fatal.

Hit him with a bat
a couple of times,

a little pistol whipping.

They'll want $500 for it,

but if I help Mickey
move some meth next week,

they'll settle for $200.

That's a discount beating.

What do you say?

Guys, we can't--

We need a house.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll be scraping blood and shit

from under my fingernails,

and then I'll be at V's
getting drunk,

pretending I didn't just
order a hit on a relative.

All right.

Frank, what are you doing?

Sheila, this is Christopher.

As his AA sponsor,

I'm helping him to walk
the straight and narrow.

Well, that's nice, but how can
you be his sponsor when you--

- I said to him, "if you're
serious about recovery,

you're gonna need
24-hour-a-day oversight.

I'm just gonna have
to move in with you."

Really?

That Frank would do this,
disrupt his own life...

All I ask in return
is your sobriety.

Here, take this down
to your van.

Oh!

Nice meeting you.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Thank you, Frank.
Great job.

Never let it be said
that Frank Gallagher

outstays his welcome.

Karen, look what they gave me
when I offered to volunteer.

Pamphlets and buttons
and a banner and t-shirts.

Why don't you
come with me tomorrow?

I'm gonna have a table
outside the market.

- No thanks, mom.
- Can I ask why not?

Because they call themselves
retard nation.

It's offensive.

No, we're-- we're--

we're challenging society's
preconceptions.

This is genius.
"I am a retard."

Yeah, but read the back.

"And proud."
I'm gonna need five of these.

A lot of retards
at the Alibi.

Frank, I'm not comfortable
with how you're using that word.

Retard?
You're saying it.

Yeah, but you don't
have Down's Syndrome.

Neither do you.

I know, but my intent
is to defend free speech

and to further public
awareness and end hate.

And your intent
is simply to be rude.

Hello?

V?

Oh!

Uh, oh, sorry.

Oh.

Ahh.

Ugh, ah.

That threw me off.
Periscope down.

Hey.

Look, you need to back off
the Gallagher house.

If you don't,
you'll be sorry.

Groans

Fuck sake.

A .22?

You sure it'll stop me?

You want to find out?

What the fuck are you doing?

Get up and
knock him on his ass.

I got him covered.

I'd like you to meet the wife,
Ellen.

They're removing
the toilets.

I'll get some buckets.

I guess it didn't work out
with your brother.

Mandy, are we getting
our money back?

Minus $100.
He took a chain off Mickey.

Over there.
By the couch.

Yeah, just leave it.

Bye, honey, off to work.

Why is he leaving
a toilet in our living room?

Bye, honey!
I'm off to work!

We are so losing the house.

- I told you we are going--
- To be fine, I know.

But will we be fine here
or somewhere else?

The probate hearing
is tomorrow.

Maybe we'll get lucky.

If not, I will find us
a place to live, okay?

Please drop Liam at V's
on your way to school.

Everyone else,
grab a lunch and head out.

No truant Gallaghers today.

Hammers banging

You know, being guardian
doesn't make you super-mom.

You noticed.

I'm just saying,
it's not all on you.

Thanks.

Drill whirring

How are you this morning?

Never better.

Replacing the toilet
with a low-flow model,

much more efficient.

I bet it lowers
the water bill.

Oh, without question.

Patrick, we got off
on the wrong foot.

Sending Mickey Milkovich over
with a baseball bat, hmm?

Is that the foot you mean?

If we let you take the house,
will you rent it to us?

Sure.

Call it $1,800 a month,

first, last, and deposit.

You know we don't have
that kind of--

No?

I thought living in squalor
was a lifestyle choice.

It's just that when we first
started this with mom,

we approached it
like a medical procedure,

but these last few times,
is it me

or was she acting
like she was on a date?

She always dresses nice.

Musk perfume,
gold tips.

When has she ever worn gold tips
to our house, Kev?

Like I'd notice.

So you have no idea
what I'm talking about?

Baby, maybe she made
an extra effort.

Aha!

What's wrong with that?

Low-cut dress,
"fuck-me" pumps.

Maybe she's excited
to have a grandchild,

wants me to be
properly motivated.

And that doesn't
freak you out?

This whole thing
freaks me out,

and I'm trying
not to think about it.

I'm like
a professional athlete.

If I think, it affects
my performance.

My job is to not think.

Fuck! Fuck!

If you're gonna
follow me to work,

how about giving me a ride?

Not your chauffeur, bro.

Don't burn the milk.

It's not good
when you burn it.

Jim!

Andy from med school.

I'm at County General
down the street.

No kidding.

Good to see you.

I love this place.
Great coffee.

You're a working man now, huh?

Oh, management trainee.

You know, they won't let you
buy a franchise

till you run
one of their stores.

Nice.

I hear these places
are a gold mine.

What can I get you, man?

Hey, you know Adam britt,
Nick Stathis, Mark?

They're all doing
residencies in Chicago.

Nick's ortho,
Mark's a surgeon.

We're grabbing dinner
tomorrow night.

You should join us.

Yeah, sounds fun.

But I'm not sure if I can.

They would love to see you.
You gotta come.

Um, double cappuccino
with non-fat.

I was gonna wait
for the landlord,

but somebody already
kicked the door in for us.

That's considerate.

At least
it's in our price range.

Barely.

Well, it's not like we live
in the Gold Coast now.

Place just needs some paint,
a case of roach motels.

Down the road,
maybe we save some money

and find a house
back in our old hood.

Need a crack pipe?

Better not touch that.

Touch it?
I'm ready to smoke out of it.

I guess I'll call the landlord
and tell him we'll take it.

Retches

I need you to watch
your baby brother.

And who's that puking
on his Timberlands?

Cousin Patrick.

He's got nausea,
shortness of breath,

blood in urine,
severe illness, and death.

What the hell
are you reading?

Rat poison.

Hi! Hi!

We are Retard Nation.

Yeah, we're
a local organization,

but as the name suggests,
we are going national.

We're promoting the idea
that people with Down's Syndrome

need to reclaim
their own identities

in order to define themselves.

So if you'd like to,
you can make a donation

or if you'd like to buy
a t-shirt or just get signed--

What the hell is this?

Well, we're a local
organization, Retard Nation--

Take it down now.

Sir, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

Lady, you're not gonna stand
in front of my market

with this goddamn sign.

Pack it up now or I'll do it,
all right?

Sir, we will not
be intimidated by normies.

- By what?
- By normies.

Goddamn it,
get this crap out of here.

- Don't!
- All of it.

- Ma'am, I'm very sorry--
- Don't!

Do not touch me
in front of my market.

This is hate speech.
Get your hands off of me.

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation.

So this is it.

It's only a one-bedroom,
but I'm at work a lot.

- Christopher.
- Yeah, Frank?

In order
for the healing to begin,

it's important
that you be honest

and tell me
where you hide your booze.

Under the cushions?
Back of the closet?

I know all the tricks.

I threw it out.

Do you mind if I look around
in case you missed a bottle?

Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

Where do you work?

I'm a vet tech for the city.

I deal with
stray cats and dogs.

Meaning you kill them?

In veterinary parlance,
it's called "control."

Sometimes I rescue
a beauty like Bessie there.

It makes me feel better
about it all.

Hey, I've got
a surprise for you.

Why don't I grab it?

- What sort of surprise?
- You'll see!

Hey.

You know your dog is dead,
right?

Taxidermy
is a hobby of mine.

Sighs

So when you say rescue,

you mean bring them home
and stuff them,

because most people
when they used that word--

Meatball subs!

Like you said, remember?

Simple pleasures.

Living in the moment.

Sounds like something
I would say.

You mentioned
you're a Bears fan.

There's no game on, but I've got
last season's highlights.

You eat, I'll cue it up.

You want a blanket?

It's kind of chilly.

I have a new respect
for baristas.

It turns out it's
a highly demanding craft.

Who knew?

You keep burning the shit
out of your--

what's up?

Tell him.

I killed Patrick.

What?

Option four. Kill Patrick.

Why skip an option?

The whole life in prison
thing, sweetheart.

I realize you've had sketchy
parental role models, okay?

But as your
newly appointed guardian,

can we agree that
offing people is not cool?

Can we get on
the same page with that?

Yeah.

If this comes back to us,

if we get charged
with homicide,

do you realize
how serious that is?

What?

Liam.

Oh, Liam.

Oh, got him in time.

We need to come up
with an explanation

in case the cops
tie this to us.

Like we have rats and
Carl threw poison everywhere.

- That works.
- It does?

Anyone who knows you
will know it's not far-fetched.

Debbie, go get everyone so
we can get our story straight.

Okay.

I'm raising a sociopath.

I'm sure that your cousin
went to the hospital,

so he'll probably live.
Hopefully.

Mandy,
I thought that was you.

What the fuck you doing here?

Re-enrolling.

So I know you're seeing Lip,

but like I told him,
I think it's great.

You talked to Lip?

I came by last Tuesday
to say hi.

I didn't come inside.

Lip didn't want me inside,

because, you know,
he didn't want to upset you.

Why would I be upset?

Oh, you wouldn't.

Forget it.

I just meant
I'm happy for you guys.

Latte.

Wait till you try
these pancakes.

Organic blueberries.

You're adjusting very well
for an addict.

Thanks to you, sponsor.

If it weren't for you,

this place would be littered
with whiskey bottles.

What was
your drink of choice?

Terry's.

Never heard of that.

Terry's, uh,
malted whiskey.

You mean malt whiskey?
Like single malt?

Well, all kinds of malt.

Get up in the morning
and drink a full keg of beer.

Man, was that bad.

A keg is 15 gallons.

I didn't know better,

I would think
you're making stuff up.

Our relationship is based
on honesty, Christopher.

I tried to drink alcohol.

I just don't like the taste.

Jesus Christ!
You're not an alcoholic?

Forgive me.

Well, then why go to AA?
Why have me as your sponsor?

Please, Frank,
please, don't move out.

Everything is going
so good with us.

I won't lie to you again.

I promise.

I'll make us prime rib.

Groans

Last night of mom's
ovulation cycle, thank God.

She just needs to screw Kev
and not enjoy it.

That's not unreasonable.

That's what every daughter
wants from her mother.

What time is it?

3:15 and still no Patrick.

We don't want him to come,
do we?

It's kind of a toss-up.

If he does show,
the judge gives our house away.

If he doesn't,
he's probably dead,

so we get to keep the house
until we all go to prison.

The estate
of Ginger Gallagher.

Here we go.

Guys.

Cough

What now?
Start packing?

Fiona said that you guys
found a place to rent.

Did you take any photos?

You're kidding.

You're serious.

You knew Karen was in town,
didn't you?

I heard that, yeah.

You heard it.

I saw her.

Saw her or fucked her?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I don't want to be
somewhere that I'm not wanted,

so man up, tell me.

I have a problem
with you being here.

You act like
we had a conversation,

never happened.

That I said that it was okay
for you to leave your stuff here

and show up uninvited, do my
laundry, and act like my wife.

But we-- we never
had that conversation,

did we?

I never asked you to be here.

I don't fucking
deserve this.

You found
a new house for rent?

That's great.

Landlord says
it's ours if we want it.

New school?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I never should
have let this happen.

I'm so sorry.

I'm kind of sick
of this place anyway.

Nice to have a change.

Techno music

Speaking portuguese

Hey.

Going out tonight with
some medical school friends.

Totally upstanding citizens.
You wanna give me a ride?

- I'm not your chauffeur.
- "Not your chauffeur," right.

So you'd rather me
take the El train,

make you get out of your car
to follow me.



Chicago and La Salle.



Don't you look nice.

Yes, she does.

I brought some rose

and some more candles
and some CDs.

You like D'Angelo, Kevie?

You know, a little music
to set the mood.

It's great you want
to set the mood, mama.

It's just Kev and I want
to keep this straight forward,

more like a procedure.

As opposed to what?

- A date.
- Excuse me?

I'm not some whore who comes
over in a raggedy t-shirt,

has relations with
your boyfriend, and leaves.

If we gonna do this,

we might as well
get some ambiance up in here.

Otherwise,
get some trashy thing

won't mind if you bend her
over the kitchen table.

She didn't mean it
like that, mama.

Is this happening or not?

I want to hear my CD.

Knocking at door

Come in.

Oh.

Not who I was expecting.

That guy in New York, he, uh,
he really take your money?

Think I would lie
about that?

Well, why not?

It'll make everyone feel bad
for you, lower their guard.

Poor Karen, back home
with her tail between her legs.

That's right.

It's all an act.

You talk to Mandy?

Who?

Oh, Mandy, right.

Yeah, at school.

Kind of a skank,
don't you think?

So you dropped napalm
on my relationship

without even getting
your hands dirty.

Well, it's not like
you lost your touch.

What do you want?

Take your clothes off.

Horns honking

Hey!

Hey!

You think
that t-shirt's funny?

No.
No, it's-- it's political.

It's actually pro-tard.

Yeah?
Well, tell that to my sister.

Oh, shit.

Nice.

Ooh, that's it, baby,
that's it.

Ooh, ooh, yeah.

Ooh.

Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

Ooh, that's it.

Ooh, bring it home.

Bring it home, baby.

Ooh, yeah.

Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

Stop!

Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

You people want to have
a baby, beautiful.

Find another way to do it.

I can't be working
under these conditions.

All right,
we'll call you.

Moaning

Karen, honey,
can you come down?

- Don't stop.
- I wasn't planning on it.

Karen,
Mrs. Wong is here.

Oh, come on in.

Timmy saw you
at the supermarket.

Oh, oh, that's just my
volunteer work for Hymie's sake.

- You have to stop that shit.
- Gasps Excuse me?

Timmy saw you fight
with that man.

He's embarrassed for you.

Well, I don't know
if it's a cultural thing

and you're not aware,
but you're being rude right now.

Jody, can you help Mrs. Wong
with the crib?

You act crazy.

I can't leave
the baby with you.

What about you trying to cure
him with your Chinese herbs?

I mean, you need to accept him
for who he is.

No more baby.

Let me know which car's yours.
I'll load it up for you.

She's hoarding Hymie.

What?

Okay, I won't volunteer
anymore if that's what you want.

You promise?

I promise.

I bring the baby tomorrow,

but I stay to watch you.

Okay.

Blue Impala.

Okay.

Your Karen is right.

This is not a good place
for baby.

Karen? My--

when did you talk to Karen?

What kind of a creep
uses Alcoholics Anonymous

to cater
to his nefarious agenda?

It is a slap in the face

to everyone
who attends the program.

Nice shirt, Frank.

Not that we didn't know.

Laughter

So he doesn't need
a sponsor.

But he lets you live there
rent-free, and he's feeding you?

It doesn't add up,
does it?

Well, if I were you,
I'd make sure

that he's not a rapist
or a serial killer.

I mean,
you said he's a loner, right?

Super neat?
I bet he's got hardwood floors.

So?

Carpets get bloodstains.

What's he do for a living?

He kills animals,
occasionally stuffs them.

He what?

It's called "animal control"
in veterinary parlance.

It's called he's
Jeffrey fucking Dahmer, dude.

He finds a guy
no one will miss,

gets them to move in with him,
pumps them full of vet drugs.

He's gonna drill
a hole in your head

and turn you
into his zombie sex slave.

Before we get carried away,

Christopher
had a sponsor before me.

The guy moved to Florida.

Oh, he moved to Florida.

And who told you that,
Christopher?

Christopher.

Be careful, Frank.

You're gonna wake up

and find your dick
in a ziploc in his freezer.

 I wanna have
the world at my feet

 I need to know

 just how sweet
is sweet

 I'm gonna take my kicks
as they come

 yeah,
I'm gonna have some fun

 I want to be
high up on top

 I've got no choice

 I just can't stop

Fiona!

What's going on?

I've got Patrick Gallagher
outside with an eviction notice.

You're throwing us out?

This was supposed to take
a couple of weeks.

Normally.
The guy seems like an asshole.

I'm trying to chill him out,

but he's made
a couple accusations.

He said you tried to kill him.

That's ridiculous.

He has a toxicology report
from the hospital.

He says he won't press charges
if you move out tonight.

He can't be serious.

He seems to be serious.

But Patrick loves me.

Yeah, well,
is there a place you can go?

Tonight?
No.

Patrick gave me candy.

Debs, go get Lip and Ian,
please.

And then he got
in bed with me

and touched me
in my nice places.

What was that?

About candy
or Patrick touching me?

Patrick Gallagher?

Mm-hmm.

And when you say
"nice places"?

Uh, private places.

Frank?

Aw, fuck.

Frank?

Frank.
Frank.

Frank.

Frank.

Aghh!
Get away from me!

These people are witnesses.

Where have you been?

I've been looking
all over for you.

What do you want?

Are you all right?
Have you had a relapse?

Don't touch me.

I could be your sponsor.
I'm not a drinker,

but I've been to so many
meetings, I know the procedure.

No!
No, no, thank you.

I'm sorry
if I freaked you out.

I'm not real good with,
well, with people, really.

It was great
having someone to talk to.

Get a room, assholes.

I'm sorry, Frank.

See you around.

Wait, wait.

You're not gonna stuff me
or drill a hole in my head?

What?

Your interest in me is not
of a perverse or sexual nature?

No,
nothing like that.

I mean, if you're saying
you want to have sex with me,

I guess I'd do my best.

What happened
to your old sponsor?

Either he's in Florida,

or he's avoiding me,
thinks I'm creepy,

being clingy and all,
and lonely.

So basically
the problem is you're clingy.

What's for dinner
at your place?

Rib eyes.

But we stop at the liquor
store, and you're paying?

- Anything you want.
- Let's go.

Really?
You mean it?

Oh, clingy
is a walk in the park.

Here, have it.

- I really like her.
- Yeah?

She's a poet.

Karen.

Oh, mom,
you scared me.

You told me you
came home to be with Hymie,

but you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Why would you do that?

I missed you, mom.

So it's true.

Everything was better
before Hymie came along,

just you and me.

I wanted us back.

I love you.

You're shitting me.

Standard police procedure, sir.

We'll have to meet
the sex crimes detectives

- at the station, unless--
- Unless what?

- The charges are dropped.
- Charges are--?

400 a month rent,
no deposit.

Are you in on this?

I'm not in on anything, sir.

I am, however, gonna make
a radio call from the car.

You can take your 400
and shove it up your ass.

I remember your hands
touching me and--

- $1,200.

You said it was
our little secret.

I knew it was wrong.

Jesus, what--

900, final offer.

500, no deposit.

I need a 50-year lease,
and I want that in writing.

Groans

Hey, check it out.

Left a poison sandwich
in the crawl space.

- Don't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

Ugh, too late.

Why the outpouring
of affection?

We didn't lose the house.

I was molested.
It all worked out.

- What?
- We can stay.

I put your toothbrush
back in the cup.

Want an eye mask?

Curtains let
a lot of light in.

Thanks.

- Night, Frank.
- Good night, Christopher.

I'm going to bed, babe.

All right,
I'll be up in a second.

Text alert

Who's that?

- Carol.
- My mother?

My mother is texting you at 1:30
in the fucking morning?

Shit, that's not funny, is it?

I'm just playing.

It's Kate calling in sick
for her shift tomorrow.

I'm sorry, baby.

Rock music





I'm raising five kids,
and I didn't miss last week.

What's your excuse?

Shut the fuck up!

I need you
to get a will notarized.

- Will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

A will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah, we're gonna need
a body too.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

I'm here to file a will,
please.

Ginger Gallagher.
Second one today.

Supersedes yours.

Who the hell filed it?
Cousin Patrick.

Both: Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Kev is just gonna lie down
with you for procreation.

Okay, let's get this going.

- Laughs
- Shh, knock it off, mama.

How many more times
are we gonna have to do this?

Until we complete
the mission.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I got to hit the Alibi
in ten minutes anyway.

- I'm good to stay.
- Please just go home

to your own
fucking house for once.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big,
just some walking around money.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

- Mom.
- Oh!

Where is he, my baby?

He's where
he belongs for now,

and you're back
where you belong.

Now, if I allow you
to retain your parental rights,

would you consent to
your daughter becoming guardian?

Works for me.

Would you agree to be
the guardian of these children?

Yes, I do.




High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Thank you all for coming out
in honor of Aunt Ginger.

"GG" as I called her.

You now, when the guy
at the funeral place

handed me her ashes,
I thought,

what the hell
do I do with these?

Put 'em in a vase
on my mantle?

Or scatter them
at the park or the lake?

Then I thought, no,

I know where
she was happiest.

On this corner,
her corner,

where she turned tricks
in her 20s and 30s.

And 60s!

- She did magic tricks?
- No, no, no, son.

"Turning tricks" is
a euphemism for prostitution.

In her day, your great aunt was
a legendary pole smoker.

Could unlock her jaw
like a Burmese python.

We are at her funeral.

You know,
some think Gallaghers

don't have a work ethic,

but Ginger worked this corner
rain, sleet, snow,

her old knees hitting
that hard pavement

again and again.

Bertie Giddelman is the only one
that's outlasted her.

Look, you all knew Ginger,
so I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

She was a mean old bitch.

But even a mean old bitch
deserves a send off.

Here, here.

So this is us, Ginger,

sending you off,
right where you belong.

It's touching.

I'm tearing up.

Okay, kids, let's go.

Patrick.

So Ginger had a will
that we didn't know about,

and you just had it sitting
in a drawer?

Yep.

And even though
she hated your guts,

she left our house to you?

It was never your house.

It's weird, you know,

how she signed the will
only a year ago,

you know, her being
an invalid and all.

Signed and notarized.

I don't remember you
coming by with a lawyer.

I gotta get back
to my family.

Six kids
with nowhere else to go.

Why don't
we talk about this

when the sting of losing Ginger
has worn off, hmm?

Tomorrow, maybe?

You want to tell them
or should I?

V, your mom's here.

Ooh.
You look really nice, Carol.

- Thank you, honey.
- You do look nice.

- Where'd you get that dress?
- Madison's.

And those shoes.

You doing something
at church later?

I'm ovulating again.

Ovulating?

No, it's not until next week.
I got the calendar.

High body temperature,
sore breasts,

increased cervical mucus.

We believe you, mama.

Well, if you all want
to try again,

we have a four-day window.

Guess no need to waste
an opportunity, right, baby?

What, you wanna do this
right now?

Like, right now?

Well, I can come back.

No, no need.

I'm like a stud bull.

You open the barn door,
slap me on the ass.

You know, I mean, when I say,
"open the barn door,"

I don't mean your, um--

uh, do you guys
want a drink?

I'll get three glasses.

Are you sure you just want
to jump into this?

You don't want a minute
to think?

Waiting isn't gonna
make it easier.

All right, I'm gonna
block everything out,

and I'm just gonna picture
your beautiful face.

- I picture Denzel Washington.
- Oh, for real?

When I open my eyes a little
and I see it's a white guy,

eh, then I go
with Johnny Depp.

Oh?

You appreciate the irony,
right?

Senseless arguments about
who gets what bedroom,

refusing to allow me to stay.

- Now, nobody gets to stay.
- Why is Frank here again?

There's a small chance
he'll be able to help

since he's known Patrick
longer than any of us.

Patrick wants
to steal our house?

He's a contractor.
He's gonna flip it.

Slap a coat of paint on it,

call it
"a cozy, authentic pre-war,"

and offload it to yuppies.

Not gonna happen.

- So let's go over our options.
- I'll write them down.

All right, look, we know
the will is bullshit.

It was signed a year ago,

and Ginger's
been dead for what, 10?

More like 15.

Option one.
Prove will is a forgery.

We can't call the cops
because we faked Ginger's death

and forged a will of our own.

Plus Frank's been cashing
Ginger's social security checks.

Oh, like you didn't share
in that bounty?

What we could do,
we could argue

that Ginger wasn't of
sound mind when she signed it.

I mean, she was
never of sound mind anyway.

Option two.
Say Ginger was crazy.

Or convince Patrick
to back off somehow.

Yeah, that's three.

Good luck with that!

His nickname
used to be Pit Bull.

It was partly an odor thing,

but also because once he gets
ahold of you, he doesn't let go.

You gotta kill him first.

Option four. Kill Patrick.

It's time to face reality.

Patrick out-Gallaghered us,

and there's no point
in fighting it.

Easy for you to say,
you're at Sheila's.

So before you're out
on the streets

like so many Somalian refugees,
ask yourselves,

"if Patrick
is taking the house,

what are we taking?"

Copper pipes.

You're not taking the pipes,
Frank.

You really think there's
a way to challenge the will?

Why not? You know,
if I can bone up on probate law.

All in favor.

Unanimous.

Well, like hell it is.

Lip will handle the will.

The rest of you,

get ready for the first day
of school tomorrow.

Debbie and Carl,
pick out something to wear

that doesn't have holes.

Wouldn't it just be easier
to kill him?

Clothes, now.

We better work fast.

Winter's coming, and it'll
be cold sleeping in the park.

This is why democracy
does not work.

Time to get out
the "help wanted" ads.

- How you holding up?
- You know what I want?

Not to win the lottery or
go on vacation to the Caribbean.

I want normal people problems.

Like,
am I getting enough fiber?

Why did my friend
say that insensitive thing

about my weight?

Well, it'll work out,
it always does.

You realize only rich people
say shit like that.

What's that
supposed to mean?

That we have no backup plan.

There's no running
to mom and dad.

And that's what I do?

I'm saying neither one of us
has a job.

One week with me
as their guardian, one,

they're about to be homeless.

Then we'll get jobs.

I mean, the Gallaghers
are survivors, right?

We can do this.

We?

You, me, we.

Since when
are you a lawyer?

Since never,

which is why I have to read up
on this shit.

How 'bout
I give you a hummer,

help you relax?

I don't think that's
gonna help my productivity.

You can multitask.

 Said I find it hard



Would you, uh...

would you be offended
if I kept working?

Knock at door

Lip, can we talk?

Yeah, if you can talk
from out there.

It's private.

This better be good.



 sometimes we know

 but sometimes

 oh baby sometimes

 you gotta get
what you need



I rang the doorbell,

but Ian had me wait out here.

I don't think
he likes me anymore.

I don't think
he ever liked you.

I got your message.

Right, the one where I told
you to go fuck yourself?

It was nice
to hear your voice.

Eiffel Tower?

Yeah, this guy said
he'd take me to Paris,

so I had this done.

But he took all my money

and tried to sell me
to a sheikh from Yemen.

So, yeah, things got bad
for a little while.

But anyways,

I'm-- I'm home now.

That sounds shitty.

Is Mandy inside?

Yeah.

So that's why Ian
had me wait out here?

That'd be my guess.

Are you happy?

Sure.

Well, good, because
I want you to be happy.

You deserve it.

Well, I--

I better get back.

You look good.

Welcome back.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- You have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.

Well, here's a good one.

Barista at the coffee beanery.

Shelly Espinosa works there,
makes like 20 grand.

A month?
A year?

Shit.
How do people live on that?

So the cleaning posse guys
called back.

An effluent tank overflowed
at the slaughterhouse.

They can use us both.
$14.50 an hour.

- A what tank?
- Effluent.

See, I told you
it would work out.

It's so exciting having you
back in your old room.

I just wish I had seen
Hymie in his crib.

Well, Mrs. Wong
can bring Hymie by anytime.

How is he?

He's wonderful.

Oh my gosh,
he is such a sweet boy.

And now that you're home,
I'm sure the Wongs

will let us spend more time
with him.

I'm not sure I'm ready
for that yet.

I know you want to be
involved in Hymie's life.

In fact, I found a flyer
for a support group.

Support for what?

For families affected
with Down's Syndrome.

I thought it might be a way
for us to educate ourselves

about Hymie's needs.

Be grateful
the kid's not here.

Butt out, Frank!

Children in the Cambodian
killing fields

turned their parents
over for execution.

A lifetime of devotion,
that's the loyalty it buys you.

Who wants lasagna?

Oh, Karen,
please put your pants on.

What?
It's not like I'm naked.

I'm in recovery.
I'm hypersensitive.

That's a good idea.

Jody, there's only three
plates here.

You might want to get one
for Karen.

Mouthing silently

I'm gonna go make a salad.

Oh, great.

Um...

Frank.

Uh-huh?

Honey, we've been through
a lot together.

That we have, Sheils,
that we have.

Um, but Hymie's gone,

and with Karen and Jody here,
it's kind of a full house.

What?

No.
No, no, no, don't say that.

Frank, I'm just asking you
to go home to your family.

My family threw me out with
no regard for my well-being.

Do you want me homeless?

Do you want me
wandering the streets

just as old man winter
winds his way down

from the frozen north?

Don't you have someone you can
stay with, like a friend?

Just as I'm getting
my life together.

I'm going to AA.

You go because
a judge ordered you to go.

Sheila.

Frank, you're a good man,

but you've got to find
another place to stay.

Jesus, Carl,
there's enough to go around.

Would you grab the paper bags?

If we have to move,
where do we go?

We're not moving.

How's it going
with Ginger's will?

Working on it.

V, thanks for
taking Liam today.

I pretend he's
my little black baby,

and when he's cranky and smelly,
I get to bring him back.

Where is Liam?

Trying out
the big boy toilet.

And you left him there?

Debbie, that is not
the outfit that we picked out

for your first day, and you are
so not leaving here in that.

- I borrowed it from Mandy.
- Clearly.

You do realize that
I'm in middle school now, right?

Yeah, not stripper school.
Go change.

Knocking at door
Somebody get that.

Mandy, she's 13.

She's not working the bedroom
at the Mustang Ranch.

Yeah, like you never wore
a short skirt

when you were her age.

Jeez, Fi,
she's just trying to help.

Knocking at door
I'll get it.

Can you take
Liam tomorrow too?

Not sure yet.

Those fruits of Islam people
on 4th have a free daycare.

If I say I hate whitey,

I bet they'll watch him
for a few hours.

So is Lip getting serious
about Mandy "Skankovich"?

Nice.

Oh, shit, Mandy, I'm sorry.

You know I would have never
said that to your face.

Should I apologize or leave?

I'm gonna leave.

You and I both know you're not
legally entitled to shit.

Patrick?

You remember my sons,
Desmond and Warren.

What are you doing here?

Oh, just a quick walkthrough
to assess repairs,

shouldn't take too long.

It'd be quicker
if you just left.

You're the ones
that are gonna be leaving.

Assuming your bullshit will
stands up in court.

Probate hearing
is on Thursday.

This Thursday?

Uh-huh.
Why prolong the inevitable?

I'm gonna need you
out on Saturday

so I can spray the place
with insecticide,

rip up this piss carpet,

and, you know,
make it livable.

Boys, start upstairs.

We've got kids
living here,

and you're just gonna
throw us out?

How do you sleep at night?

Don't blame your miserable
goddamn lives on me.

Indistinct chatter

Okay, listen up.

Some of you have inquired
about our petition.

We have demanded that
Lincoln Grove high school

offer programs
for special students

to help them fit in
with their classmates.

Applause

- Aren't you glad we came?
- Yeah.

Great, also concerning
the "R" word,

we have demanded
a school policy

forbidding students and faculty
from using that word.

- Retard.
- Excuse me.

Retard.
You can't even say it.

So how do we talk about it?

We all know your opinion
on this, Jeremy.

But right now
I'm the one speaking.

Brothers and sisters,

words only have power
if we give them power.

We must take back
the word "retard."

Make it ours.

Sweetheart, the rest of us
find the word offensive.

I'm not your sweetheart,
bitch.

All gasp

Mrs. Kandage,
I know you mean well,

but many of us here
think it's time

that we reclaim
and redefine the word.

And since normies
don't get called "retard,"

they don't have
a say in this.

Normies do not get a say.

What's a "normie?"

I think it's slang
for non-retards.

- Hey, Fabio, do you mind?
- Sorry.

I don't care how it's used.

I don't want anybody calling
my son that word ever.

It's incredibly hurtful.

Even if we did get rid of it,

someone will just think up
another way of saying it.

That's right.
The queers took back their word.

- It's different.
- How is it different?

It's not like
race issues disappear

if people stop saying nigger.

Shut the fuck up!

I can say it, you can't.

Retards,
we must ban together.

The way to get respect
is to take respect,

and normies can help us
get that message out.

Raise your hand
if you're with us!

Yeah.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

All: Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

You digging that smell?

Did something die in here?

A couple thousand somethings.

- It gets better after awhile.
- How?

Your brain
sort of short-circuits,

shuts off your sense of smell.

Tape everything up,
gloves and boots.

We got solids in there today.

Solids?

Maggots, roaches,
rats, flies.

You got roaches
inside your suit

going crazy, running all over
your short hairs,

hard to focus on work.

Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God.

Keep your mouth shut,
and I don't mean shut up.

I mean, don't let anything
splash in your mouth.

Your girlfriend
gonna be okay?

Thank you, everyone,
for sharing.

Have a good day.

Groans

Great meeting.

I just need to get
my slip signed for the court.

Okay.

Let's see.

I guess we'll see you twice
a week for at least six months.

Keep coming back, Frank.

As if I had a fucking choice.

- Congratulations.
- What?

I said congratulations.

During group share you said
you're two years sober,

unless I misunderstood.

No, that's right.
Two years today.

Oh, only six weeks for me.

It hasn't been easy.

I was downing
cleaning products, mouthwash.

- You ever try Sterno?
- Love Sterno.

It's ridiculous
what passes for alcoholism

with this group.

Her two-hour blackout?

I mean, come on.

I blacked out a year.

Am I whining about it?

Or the guy that lost his job
and banged his sister-in-law?

Where I come from,
that's Friday night.

Both chuckle

But you've been sober
two years.

That's amazing.

But it's because
you don't need booze

to fill the gaping hole
in your life.

It's about being
in the moment.

A meatball sub.

A Bears game
on the television.

Simple pleasures.

Simple pleasures, right.

Frank,
I'm Chris or Christopher.

I hope you don't mind
if I ask.

Would you be my sponsor?

- Would I--
- Sponsor me in the program.

My previous sponsor moved out
and went to Leesburg.

That's in Florida.

Right, right.
But here's the thing.

Much as I'd love to help,

and inspiring
as I would no doubt be,

your best sponsor
is yourself.

I understand.

Take care.

Wait.

You said your last sponsor
moved out.

What, he--
what, he lived with you?

- Yeah.
- In a house?

You live in a house,
an apartment, what?

A house.

I'm sorry, let me
introduce myself properly.

I'm Frank Gallagher.

Tell me your name again.

It's Chris or Christopher.

Christopher, right.

Gags

I'm getting out.

I'm getting out.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry, but no one speaking
English as a first language

should be doing this job.

The money's good.

Not that good.

So much for
"you, me, we."

I can feel cockroaches
under my suit.

On my back!
Hit me on my back!

Hit me on my-- fuck.

Oh.

Oh, hey, these candles
are a nice idea.

- Mom brought 'em.
- Oh, she did?

Just look at me.

That's it.

Oh, shit.

You're a stud bull,
aren't you, baby?

Oh, yeah.

Hold that thought.
Mom!

Jump in between us.
Hurry up.

Wasn't sure
when to bring this up,

but maybe I could use
a little warm-up this time.

Warming up,
like a jog around the block?

'Cause if you're asking Kev
to go down on you,

I can tell you right now
that is not happening.

Women are more likely to
conceive if they have an orgasm.

I read it in Cosmo.

It pulls the sperm up into--

The conversation is
not happening on this end,

just saying.

- Hey, sorry I bailed.
- Don't be sorry.

I'm sure tons of guys would
leave their girlfriends alone

to shovel blood and shit.

I went down to the coffee
beanery and got a job.

How much per hour?

I mean, you know, not
as much as the cleaning posse,

but all the coffee
you can drink.

- Full-time?
- Close.

- How close?
- Part-time.

There are opportunities
for advancement.

The manager was saying--

We've reconvened
the Cousin Patrick war council.

No luck on the legal front?

No, it turns out
it's pretty hard to prove

that someone had dementia
when they signed a will.

In our case,
very fucking hard.

Because she was already dead.

- What was option two again?
- We're on three now.

Convince Patrick to back off.

Or option four,
kill Patrick.

Back to three.
Convince him how?

We get my brothers to go
around and scare him a little.

No way.

Enough with
the brothers Milkovich.

Nothing fatal.

Hit him with a bat
a couple of times,

a little pistol whipping.

They'll want $500 for it,

but if I help Mickey
move some meth next week,

they'll settle for $200.

That's a discount beating.

What do you say?

Guys, we can't--

We need a house.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll be scraping blood and shit

from under my fingernails,

and then I'll be at V's
getting drunk,

pretending I didn't just
order a hit on a relative.

All right.

Frank, what are you doing?

Sheila, this is Christopher.

As his AA sponsor,

I'm helping him to walk
the straight and narrow.

Well, that's nice, but how can
you be his sponsor when you--

- I said to him, "if you're
serious about recovery,

you're gonna need
24-hour-a-day oversight.

I'm just gonna have
to move in with you."

Really?

That Frank would do this,
disrupt his own life...

All I ask in return
is your sobriety.

Here, take this down
to your van.

Oh!

Nice meeting you.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Thank you, Frank.
Great job.

Never let it be said
that Frank Gallagher

outstays his welcome.

Karen, look what they gave me
when I offered to volunteer.

Pamphlets and buttons
and a banner and t-shirts.

Why don't you
come with me tomorrow?

I'm gonna have a table
outside the market.

- No thanks, mom.
- Can I ask why not?

Because they call themselves
retard nation.

It's offensive.

No, we're-- we're--

we're challenging society's
preconceptions.

This is genius.
"I am a retard."

Yeah, but read the back.

"And proud."
I'm gonna need five of these.

A lot of retards
at the Alibi.

Frank, I'm not comfortable
with how you're using that word.

Retard?
You're saying it.

Yeah, but you don't
have Down's Syndrome.

Neither do you.

I know, but my intent
is to defend free speech

and to further public
awareness and end hate.

And your intent
is simply to be rude.

Hello?

V?

Oh!

Uh, oh, sorry.

Oh.

Ahh.

Ugh, ah.

That threw me off.
Periscope down.

Hey.

Look, you need to back off
the Gallagher house.

If you don't,
you'll be sorry.

Groans

Fuck sake.

A .22?

You sure it'll stop me?

You want to find out?

What the fuck are you doing?

Get up and
knock him on his ass.

I got him covered.

I'd like you to meet the wife,
Ellen.

They're removing
the toilets.

I'll get some buckets.

I guess it didn't work out
with your brother.

Mandy, are we getting
our money back?

Minus $100.
He took a chain off Mickey.

Over there.
By the couch.

Yeah, just leave it.

Bye, honey, off to work.

Why is he leaving
a toilet in our living room?

Bye, honey!
I'm off to work!

We are so losing the house.

- I told you we are going--
- To be fine, I know.

But will we be fine here
or somewhere else?

The probate hearing
is tomorrow.

Maybe we'll get lucky.

If not, I will find us
a place to live, okay?

Please drop Liam at V's
on your way to school.

Everyone else,
grab a lunch and head out.

No truant Gallaghers today.

Hammers banging

You know, being guardian
doesn't make you super-mom.

You noticed.

I'm just saying,
it's not all on you.

Thanks.

Drill whirring

How are you this morning?

Never better.

Replacing the toilet
with a low-flow model,

much more efficient.

I bet it lowers
the water bill.

Oh, without question.

Patrick, we got off
on the wrong foot.

Sending Mickey Milkovich over
with a baseball bat, hmm?

Is that the foot you mean?

If we let you take the house,
will you rent it to us?

Sure.

Call it $1,800 a month,

first, last, and deposit.

You know we don't have
that kind of--

No?

I thought living in squalor
was a lifestyle choice.

It's just that when we first
started this with mom,

we approached it
like a medical procedure,

but these last few times,
is it me

or was she acting
like she was on a date?

She always dresses nice.

Musk perfume,
gold tips.

When has she ever worn gold tips
to our house, Kev?

Like I'd notice.

So you have no idea
what I'm talking about?

Baby, maybe she made
an extra effort.

Aha!

What's wrong with that?

Low-cut dress,
"fuck-me" pumps.

Maybe she's excited
to have a grandchild,

wants me to be
properly motivated.

And that doesn't
freak you out?

This whole thing
freaks me out,

and I'm trying
not to think about it.

I'm like
a professional athlete.

If I think, it affects
my performance.

My job is to not think.

Fuck! Fuck!

If you're gonna
follow me to work,

how about giving me a ride?

Not your chauffeur, bro.

Don't burn the milk.

It's not good
when you burn it.

Jim!

Andy from med school.

I'm at County General
down the street.

No kidding.

Good to see you.

I love this place.
Great coffee.

You're a working man now, huh?

Oh, management trainee.

You know, they won't let you
buy a franchise

till you run
one of their stores.

Nice.

I hear these places
are a gold mine.

What can I get you, man?

Hey, you know Adam britt,
Nick Stathis, Mark?

They're all doing
residencies in Chicago.

Nick's ortho,
Mark's a surgeon.

We're grabbing dinner
tomorrow night.

You should join us.

Yeah, sounds fun.

But I'm not sure if I can.

They would love to see you.
You gotta come.

Um, double cappuccino
with non-fat.

I was gonna wait
for the landlord,

but somebody already
kicked the door in for us.

That's considerate.

At least
it's in our price range.

Barely.

Well, it's not like we live
in the Gold Coast now.

Place just needs some paint,
a case of roach motels.

Down the road,
maybe we save some money

and find a house
back in our old hood.

Need a crack pipe?

Better not touch that.

Touch it?
I'm ready to smoke out of it.

I guess I'll call the landlord
and tell him we'll take it.

Retches

I need you to watch
your baby brother.

And who's that puking
on his Timberlands?

Cousin Patrick.

He's got nausea,
shortness of breath,

blood in urine,
severe illness, and death.

What the hell
are you reading?

Rat poison.

Hi! Hi!

We are Retard Nation.

Yeah, we're
a local organization,

but as the name suggests,
we are going national.

We're promoting the idea
that people with Down's Syndrome

need to reclaim
their own identities

in order to define themselves.

So if you'd like to,
you can make a donation

or if you'd like to buy
a t-shirt or just get signed--

What the hell is this?

Well, we're a local
organization, Retard Nation--

Take it down now.

Sir, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

Lady, you're not gonna stand
in front of my market

with this goddamn sign.

Pack it up now or I'll do it,
all right?

Sir, we will not
be intimidated by normies.

- By what?
- By normies.

Goddamn it,
get this crap out of here.

- Don't!
- All of it.

- Ma'am, I'm very sorry--
- Don't!

Do not touch me
in front of my market.

This is hate speech.
Get your hands off of me.

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation.

So this is it.

It's only a one-bedroom,
but I'm at work a lot.

- Christopher.
- Yeah, Frank?

In order
for the healing to begin,

it's important
that you be honest

and tell me
where you hide your booze.

Under the cushions?
Back of the closet?

I know all the tricks.

I threw it out.

Do you mind if I look around
in case you missed a bottle?

Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

Where do you work?

I'm a vet tech for the city.

I deal with
stray cats and dogs.

Meaning you kill them?

In veterinary parlance,
it's called "control."

Sometimes I rescue
a beauty like Bessie there.

It makes me feel better
about it all.

Hey, I've got
a surprise for you.

Why don't I grab it?

- What sort of surprise?
- You'll see!

Hey.

You know your dog is dead,
right?

Taxidermy
is a hobby of mine.

Sighs

So when you say rescue,

you mean bring them home
and stuff them,

because most people
when they used that word--

Meatball subs!

Like you said, remember?

Simple pleasures.

Living in the moment.

Sounds like something
I would say.

You mentioned
you're a Bears fan.

There's no game on, but I've got
last season's highlights.

You eat, I'll cue it up.

You want a blanket?

It's kind of chilly.

I have a new respect
for baristas.

It turns out it's
a highly demanding craft.

Who knew?

You keep burning the shit
out of your--

what's up?

Tell him.

I killed Patrick.

What?

Option four. Kill Patrick.

Why skip an option?

The whole life in prison
thing, sweetheart.

I realize you've had sketchy
parental role models, okay?

But as your
newly appointed guardian,

can we agree that
offing people is not cool?

Can we get on
the same page with that?

Yeah.

If this comes back to us,

if we get charged
with homicide,

do you realize
how serious that is?

What?

Liam.

Oh, Liam.

Oh, got him in time.

We need to come up
with an explanation

in case the cops
tie this to us.

Like we have rats and
Carl threw poison everywhere.

- That works.
- It does?

Anyone who knows you
will know it's not far-fetched.

Debbie, go get everyone so
we can get our story straight.

Okay.

I'm raising a sociopath.

I'm sure that your cousin
went to the hospital,

so he'll probably live.
Hopefully.

Mandy,
I thought that was you.

What the fuck you doing here?

Re-enrolling.

So I know you're seeing Lip,

but like I told him,
I think it's great.

You talked to Lip?

I came by last Tuesday
to say hi.

I didn't come inside.

Lip didn't want me inside,

because, you know,
he didn't want to upset you.

Why would I be upset?

Oh, you wouldn't.

Forget it.

I just meant
I'm happy for you guys.

Latte.

Wait till you try
these pancakes.

Organic blueberries.

You're adjusting very well
for an addict.

Thanks to you, sponsor.

If it weren't for you,

this place would be littered
with whiskey bottles.

What was
your drink of choice?

Terry's.

Never heard of that.

Terry's, uh,
malted whiskey.

You mean malt whiskey?
Like single malt?

Well, all kinds of malt.

Get up in the morning
and drink a full keg of beer.

Man, was that bad.

A keg is 15 gallons.

I didn't know better,

I would think
you're making stuff up.

Our relationship is based
on honesty, Christopher.

I tried to drink alcohol.

I just don't like the taste.

Jesus Christ!
You're not an alcoholic?

Forgive me.

Well, then why go to AA?
Why have me as your sponsor?

Please, Frank,
please, don't move out.

Everything is going
so good with us.

I won't lie to you again.

I promise.

I'll make us prime rib.

Groans

Last night of mom's
ovulation cycle, thank God.

She just needs to screw Kev
and not enjoy it.

That's not unreasonable.

That's what every daughter
wants from her mother.

What time is it?

3:15 and still no Patrick.

We don't want him to come,
do we?

It's kind of a toss-up.

If he does show,
the judge gives our house away.

If he doesn't,
he's probably dead,

so we get to keep the house
until we all go to prison.

The estate
of Ginger Gallagher.

Here we go.

Guys.

Cough

What now?
Start packing?

Fiona said that you guys
found a place to rent.

Did you take any photos?

You're kidding.

You're serious.

You knew Karen was in town,
didn't you?

I heard that, yeah.

You heard it.

I saw her.

Saw her or fucked her?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I don't want to be
somewhere that I'm not wanted,

so man up, tell me.

I have a problem
with you being here.

You act like
we had a conversation,

never happened.

That I said that it was okay
for you to leave your stuff here

and show up uninvited, do my
laundry, and act like my wife.

But we-- we never
had that conversation,

did we?

I never asked you to be here.

I don't fucking
deserve this.

You found
a new house for rent?

That's great.

Landlord says
it's ours if we want it.

New school?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I never should
have let this happen.

I'm so sorry.

I'm kind of sick
of this place anyway.

Nice to have a change.

Techno music

Speaking portuguese

Hey.

Going out tonight with
some medical school friends.

Totally upstanding citizens.
You wanna give me a ride?

- I'm not your chauffeur.
- "Not your chauffeur," right.

So you'd rather me
take the El train,

make you get out of your car
to follow me.



Chicago and La Salle.



Don't you look nice.

Yes, she does.

I brought some rose

and some more candles
and some CDs.

You like D'Angelo, Kevie?

You know, a little music
to set the mood.

It's great you want
to set the mood, mama.

It's just Kev and I want
to keep this straight forward,

more like a procedure.

As opposed to what?

- A date.
- Excuse me?

I'm not some whore who comes
over in a raggedy t-shirt,

has relations with
your boyfriend, and leaves.

If we gonna do this,

we might as well
get some ambiance up in here.

Otherwise,
get some trashy thing

won't mind if you bend her
over the kitchen table.

She didn't mean it
like that, mama.

Is this happening or not?

I want to hear my CD.

Knocking at door

Come in.

Oh.

Not who I was expecting.

That guy in New York, he, uh,
he really take your money?

Think I would lie
about that?

Well, why not?

It'll make everyone feel bad
for you, lower their guard.

Poor Karen, back home
with her tail between her legs.

That's right.

It's all an act.

You talk to Mandy?

Who?

Oh, Mandy, right.

Yeah, at school.

Kind of a skank,
don't you think?

So you dropped napalm
on my relationship

without even getting
your hands dirty.

Well, it's not like
you lost your touch.

What do you want?

Take your clothes off.

Horns honking

Hey!

Hey!

You think
that t-shirt's funny?

No.
No, it's-- it's political.

It's actually pro-tard.

Yeah?
Well, tell that to my sister.

Oh, shit.

Nice.

Ooh, that's it, baby,
that's it.

Ooh, ooh, yeah.

Ooh.

Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

Ooh, that's it.

Ooh, bring it home.

Bring it home, baby.

Ooh, yeah.

Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

Stop!

Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

You people want to have
a baby, beautiful.

Find another way to do it.

I can't be working
under these conditions.

All right,
we'll call you.

Moaning

Karen, honey,
can you come down?

- Don't stop.
- I wasn't planning on it.

Karen,
Mrs. Wong is here.

Oh, come on in.

Timmy saw you
at the supermarket.

Oh, oh, that's just my
volunteer work for Hymie's sake.

- You have to stop that shit.
- Gasps Excuse me?

Timmy saw you fight
with that man.

He's embarrassed for you.

Well, I don't know
if it's a cultural thing

and you're not aware,
but you're being rude right now.

Jody, can you help Mrs. Wong
with the crib?

You act crazy.

I can't leave
the baby with you.

What about you trying to cure
him with your Chinese herbs?

I mean, you need to accept him
for who he is.

No more baby.

Let me know which car's yours.
I'll load it up for you.

She's hoarding Hymie.

What?

Okay, I won't volunteer
anymore if that's what you want.

You promise?

I promise.

I bring the baby tomorrow,

but I stay to watch you.

Okay.

Blue Impala.

Okay.

Your Karen is right.

This is not a good place
for baby.

Karen? My--

when did you talk to Karen?

What kind of a creep
uses Alcoholics Anonymous

to cater
to his nefarious agenda?

It is a slap in the face

to everyone
who attends the program.

Nice shirt, Frank.

Not that we didn't know.

Laughter

So he doesn't need
a sponsor.

But he lets you live there
rent-free, and he's feeding you?

It doesn't add up,
does it?

Well, if I were you,
I'd make sure

that he's not a rapist
or a serial killer.

I mean,
you said he's a loner, right?

Super neat?
I bet he's got hardwood floors.

So?

Carpets get bloodstains.

What's he do for a living?

He kills animals,
occasionally stuffs them.

He what?

It's called "animal control"
in veterinary parlance.

It's called he's
Jeffrey fucking Dahmer, dude.

He finds a guy
no one will miss,

gets them to move in with him,
pumps them full of vet drugs.

He's gonna drill
a hole in your head

and turn you
into his zombie sex slave.

Before we get carried away,

Christopher
had a sponsor before me.

The guy moved to Florida.

Oh, he moved to Florida.

And who told you that,
Christopher?

Christopher.

Be careful, Frank.

You're gonna wake up

and find your dick
in a ziploc in his freezer.

 I wanna have
the world at my feet

 I need to know

 just how sweet
is sweet

 I'm gonna take my kicks
as they come

 yeah,
I'm gonna have some fun

 I want to be
high up on top

 I've got no choice

 I just can't stop

Fiona!

What's going on?

I've got Patrick Gallagher
outside with an eviction notice.

You're throwing us out?

This was supposed to take
a couple of weeks.

Normally.
The guy seems like an asshole.

I'm trying to chill him out,

but he's made
a couple accusations.

He said you tried to kill him.

That's ridiculous.

He has a toxicology report
from the hospital.

He says he won't press charges
if you move out tonight.

He can't be serious.

He seems to be serious.

But Patrick loves me.

Yeah, well,
is there a place you can go?

Tonight?
No.

Patrick gave me candy.

Debs, go get Lip and Ian,
please.

And then he got
in bed with me

and touched me
in my nice places.

What was that?

About candy
or Patrick touching me?

Patrick Gallagher?

Mm-hmm.

And when you say
"nice places"?

Uh, private places.

Frank?

Aw, fuck.

Frank?

Frank.
Frank.

Frank.

Frank.

Aghh!
Get away from me!

These people are witnesses.

Where have you been?

I've been looking
all over for you.

What do you want?

Are you all right?
Have you had a relapse?

Don't touch me.

I could be your sponsor.
I'm not a drinker,

but I've been to so many
meetings, I know the procedure.

No!
No, no, thank you.

I'm sorry
if I freaked you out.

I'm not real good with,
well, with people, really.

It was great
having someone to talk to.

Get a room, assholes.

I'm sorry, Frank.

See you around.

Wait, wait.

You're not gonna stuff me
or drill a hole in my head?

What?

Your interest in me is not
of a perverse or sexual nature?

No,
nothing like that.

I mean, if you're saying
you want to have sex with me,

I guess I'd do my best.

What happened
to your old sponsor?

Either he's in Florida,

or he's avoiding me,
thinks I'm creepy,

being clingy and all,
and lonely.

So basically
the problem is you're clingy.

What's for dinner
at your place?

Rib eyes.

But we stop at the liquor
store, and you're paying?

- Anything you want.
- Let's go.

Really?
You mean it?

Oh, clingy
is a walk in the park.

Here, have it.

- I really like her.
- Yeah?

She's a poet.

Karen.

Oh, mom,
you scared me.

You told me you
came home to be with Hymie,

but you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Why would you do that?

I missed you, mom.

So it's true.

Everything was better
before Hymie came along,

just you and me.

I wanted us back.

I love you.

You're shitting me.

Standard police procedure, sir.

We'll have to meet
the sex crimes detectives

- at the station, unless--
- Unless what?

- The charges are dropped.
- Charges are--?

400 a month rent,
no deposit.

Are you in on this?

I'm not in on anything, sir.

I am, however, gonna make
a radio call from the car.

You can take your 400
and shove it up your ass.

I remember your hands
touching me and--

- $1,200.

You said it was
our little secret.

I knew it was wrong.

Jesus, what--

900, final offer.

500, no deposit.

I need a 50-year lease,
and I want that in writing.

Groans

Hey, check it out.

Left a poison sandwich
in the crawl space.

- Don't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

Ugh, too late.

Why the outpouring
of affection?

We didn't lose the house.

I was molested.
It all worked out.

- What?
- We can stay.

I put your toothbrush
back in the cup.

Want an eye mask?

Curtains let
a lot of light in.

Thanks.

- Night, Frank.
- Good night, Christopher.

I'm going to bed, babe.

All right,
I'll be up in a second.

Text alert

Who's that?

- Carol.
- My mother?

My mother is texting you at 1:30
in the fucking morning?

Shit, that's not funny, is it?

I'm just playing.

It's Kate calling in sick
for her shift tomorrow.

I'm sorry, baby.

Rock music





I'm raising five kids,
and I didn't miss last week.

What's your excuse?

Shut the fuck up!

I need you
to get a will notarized.

- Will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

A will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah, we're gonna need
a body too.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

I'm here to file a will,
please.

Ginger Gallagher.
Second one today.

Supersedes yours.

Who the hell filed it?
Cousin Patrick.

Both: Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Kev is just gonna lie down
with you for procreation.

Okay, let's get this going.

- Laughs
- Shh, knock it off, mama.

How many more times
are we gonna have to do this?

Until we complete
the mission.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I got to hit the Alibi
in ten minutes anyway.

- I'm good to stay.
- Please just go home

to your own
fucking house for once.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big,
just some walking around money.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

- Mom.
- Oh!

Where is he, my baby?

He's where
he belongs for now,

and you're back
where you belong.

Now, if I allow you
to retain your parental rights,

would you consent to
your daughter becoming guardian?

Works for me.

Would you agree to be
the guardian of these children?

Yes, I do.




High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Thank you all for coming out
in honor of Aunt Ginger.

"GG" as I called her.

You now, when the guy
at the funeral place

handed me her ashes,
I thought,

what the hell
do I do with these?

Put 'em in a vase
on my mantle?

Or scatter them
at the park or the lake?

Then I thought, no,

I know where
she was happiest.

On this corner,
her corner,

where she turned tricks
in her 20s and 30s.

And 60s!

- She did magic tricks?
- No, no, no, son.

"Turning tricks" is
a euphemism for prostitution.

In her day, your great aunt was
a legendary pole smoker.

Could unlock her jaw
like a Burmese python.

We are at her funeral.

You know,
some think Gallaghers

don't have a work ethic,

but Ginger worked this corner
rain, sleet, snow,

her old knees hitting
that hard pavement

again and again.

Bertie Giddelman is the only one
that's outlasted her.

Look, you all knew Ginger,
so I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

She was a mean old bitch.

But even a mean old bitch
deserves a send off.

Here, here.

So this is us, Ginger,

sending you off,
right where you belong.

It's touching.

I'm tearing up.

Okay, kids, let's go.

Patrick.

So Ginger had a will
that we didn't know about,

and you just had it sitting
in a drawer?

Yep.

And even though
she hated your guts,

she left our house to you?

It was never your house.

It's weird, you know,

how she signed the will
only a year ago,

you know, her being
an invalid and all.

Signed and notarized.

I don't remember you
coming by with a lawyer.

I gotta get back
to my family.

Six kids
with nowhere else to go.

Why don't
we talk about this

when the sting of losing Ginger
has worn off, hmm?

Tomorrow, maybe?

You want to tell them
or should I?

V, your mom's here.

Ooh.
You look really nice, Carol.

- Thank you, honey.
- You do look nice.

- Where'd you get that dress?
- Madison's.

And those shoes.

You doing something
at church later?

I'm ovulating again.

Ovulating?

No, it's not until next week.
I got the calendar.

High body temperature,
sore breasts,

increased cervical mucus.

We believe you, mama.

Well, if you all want
to try again,

we have a four-day window.

Guess no need to waste
an opportunity, right, baby?

What, you wanna do this
right now?

Like, right now?

Well, I can come back.

No, no need.

I'm like a stud bull.

You open the barn door,
slap me on the ass.

You know, I mean, when I say,
"open the barn door,"

I don't mean your, um--

uh, do you guys
want a drink?

I'll get three glasses.

Are you sure you just want
to jump into this?

You don't want a minute
to think?

Waiting isn't gonna
make it easier.

All right, I'm gonna
block everything out,

and I'm just gonna picture
your beautiful face.

- I picture Denzel Washington.
- Oh, for real?

When I open my eyes a little
and I see it's a white guy,

eh, then I go
with Johnny Depp.

Oh?

You appreciate the irony,
right?

Senseless arguments about
who gets what bedroom,

refusing to allow me to stay.

- Now, nobody gets to stay.
- Why is Frank here again?

There's a small chance
he'll be able to help

since he's known Patrick
longer than any of us.

Patrick wants
to steal our house?

He's a contractor.
He's gonna flip it.

Slap a coat of paint on it,

call it
"a cozy, authentic pre-war,"

and offload it to yuppies.

Not gonna happen.

- So let's go over our options.
- I'll write them down.

All right, look, we know
the will is bullshit.

It was signed a year ago,

and Ginger's
been dead for what, 10?

More like 15.

Option one.
Prove will is a forgery.

We can't call the cops
because we faked Ginger's death

and forged a will of our own.

Plus Frank's been cashing
Ginger's social security checks.

Oh, like you didn't share
in that bounty?

What we could do,
we could argue

that Ginger wasn't of
sound mind when she signed it.

I mean, she was
never of sound mind anyway.

Option two.
Say Ginger was crazy.

Or convince Patrick
to back off somehow.

Yeah, that's three.

Good luck with that!

His nickname
used to be Pit Bull.

It was partly an odor thing,

but also because once he gets
ahold of you, he doesn't let go.

You gotta kill him first.

Option four. Kill Patrick.

It's time to face reality.

Patrick out-Gallaghered us,

and there's no point
in fighting it.

Easy for you to say,
you're at Sheila's.

So before you're out
on the streets

like so many Somalian refugees,
ask yourselves,

"if Patrick
is taking the house,

what are we taking?"

Copper pipes.

You're not taking the pipes,
Frank.

You really think there's
a way to challenge the will?

Why not? You know,
if I can bone up on probate law.

All in favor.

Unanimous.

Well, like hell it is.

Lip will handle the will.

The rest of you,

get ready for the first day
of school tomorrow.

Debbie and Carl,
pick out something to wear

that doesn't have holes.

Wouldn't it just be easier
to kill him?

Clothes, now.

We better work fast.

Winter's coming, and it'll
be cold sleeping in the park.

This is why democracy
does not work.

Time to get out
the "help wanted" ads.

- How you holding up?
- You know what I want?

Not to win the lottery or
go on vacation to the Caribbean.

I want normal people problems.

Like,
am I getting enough fiber?

Why did my friend
say that insensitive thing

about my weight?

Well, it'll work out,
it always does.

You realize only rich people
say shit like that.

What's that
supposed to mean?

That we have no backup plan.

There's no running
to mom and dad.

And that's what I do?

I'm saying neither one of us
has a job.

One week with me
as their guardian, one,

they're about to be homeless.

Then we'll get jobs.

I mean, the Gallaghers
are survivors, right?

We can do this.

We?

You, me, we.

Since when
are you a lawyer?

Since never,

which is why I have to read up
on this shit.

How 'bout
I give you a hummer,

help you relax?

I don't think that's
gonna help my productivity.

You can multitask.

 Said I find it hard



Would you, uh...

would you be offended
if I kept working?

Knock at door

Lip, can we talk?

Yeah, if you can talk
from out there.

It's private.

This better be good.



 sometimes we know

 but sometimes

 oh baby sometimes

 you gotta get
what you need



I rang the doorbell,

but Ian had me wait out here.

I don't think
he likes me anymore.

I don't think
he ever liked you.

I got your message.

Right, the one where I told
you to go fuck yourself?

It was nice
to hear your voice.

Eiffel Tower?

Yeah, this guy said
he'd take me to Paris,

so I had this done.

But he took all my money

and tried to sell me
to a sheikh from Yemen.

So, yeah, things got bad
for a little while.

But anyways,

I'm-- I'm home now.

That sounds shitty.

Is Mandy inside?

Yeah.

So that's why Ian
had me wait out here?

That'd be my guess.

Are you happy?

Sure.

Well, good, because
I want you to be happy.

You deserve it.

Well, I--

I better get back.

You look good.

Welcome back.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- You have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.

Well, here's a good one.

Barista at the coffee beanery.

Shelly Espinosa works there,
makes like 20 grand.

A month?
A year?

Shit.
How do people live on that?

So the cleaning posse guys
called back.

An effluent tank overflowed
at the slaughterhouse.

They can use us both.
$14.50 an hour.

- A what tank?
- Effluent.

See, I told you
it would work out.

It's so exciting having you
back in your old room.

I just wish I had seen
Hymie in his crib.

Well, Mrs. Wong
can bring Hymie by anytime.

How is he?

He's wonderful.

Oh my gosh,
he is such a sweet boy.

And now that you're home,
I'm sure the Wongs

will let us spend more time
with him.

I'm not sure I'm ready
for that yet.

I know you want to be
involved in Hymie's life.

In fact, I found a flyer
for a support group.

Support for what?

For families affected
with Down's Syndrome.

I thought it might be a way
for us to educate ourselves

about Hymie's needs.

Be grateful
the kid's not here.

Butt out, Frank!

Children in the Cambodian
killing fields

turned their parents
over for execution.

A lifetime of devotion,
that's the loyalty it buys you.

Who wants lasagna?

Oh, Karen,
please put your pants on.

What?
It's not like I'm naked.

I'm in recovery.
I'm hypersensitive.

That's a good idea.

Jody, there's only three
plates here.

You might want to get one
for Karen.

Mouthing silently

I'm gonna go make a salad.

Oh, great.

Um...

Frank.

Uh-huh?

Honey, we've been through
a lot together.

That we have, Sheils,
that we have.

Um, but Hymie's gone,

and with Karen and Jody here,
it's kind of a full house.

What?

No.
No, no, no, don't say that.

Frank, I'm just asking you
to go home to your family.

My family threw me out with
no regard for my well-being.

Do you want me homeless?

Do you want me
wandering the streets

just as old man winter
winds his way down

from the frozen north?

Don't you have someone you can
stay with, like a friend?

Just as I'm getting
my life together.

I'm going to AA.

You go because
a judge ordered you to go.

Sheila.

Frank, you're a good man,

but you've got to find
another place to stay.

Jesus, Carl,
there's enough to go around.

Would you grab the paper bags?

If we have to move,
where do we go?

We're not moving.

How's it going
with Ginger's will?

Working on it.

V, thanks for
taking Liam today.

I pretend he's
my little black baby,

and when he's cranky and smelly,
I get to bring him back.

Where is Liam?

Trying out
the big boy toilet.

And you left him there?

Debbie, that is not
the outfit that we picked out

for your first day, and you are
so not leaving here in that.

- I borrowed it from Mandy.
- Clearly.

You do realize that
I'm in middle school now, right?

Yeah, not stripper school.
Go change.

Knocking at door
Somebody get that.

Mandy, she's 13.

She's not working the bedroom
at the Mustang Ranch.

Yeah, like you never wore
a short skirt

when you were her age.

Jeez, Fi,
she's just trying to help.

Knocking at door
I'll get it.

Can you take
Liam tomorrow too?

Not sure yet.

Those fruits of Islam people
on 4th have a free daycare.

If I say I hate whitey,

I bet they'll watch him
for a few hours.

So is Lip getting serious
about Mandy "Skankovich"?

Nice.

Oh, shit, Mandy, I'm sorry.

You know I would have never
said that to your face.

Should I apologize or leave?

I'm gonna leave.

You and I both know you're not
legally entitled to shit.

Patrick?

You remember my sons,
Desmond and Warren.

What are you doing here?

Oh, just a quick walkthrough
to assess repairs,

shouldn't take too long.

It'd be quicker
if you just left.

You're the ones
that are gonna be leaving.

Assuming your bullshit will
stands up in court.

Probate hearing
is on Thursday.

This Thursday?

Uh-huh.
Why prolong the inevitable?

I'm gonna need you
out on Saturday

so I can spray the place
with insecticide,

rip up this piss carpet,

and, you know,
make it livable.

Boys, start upstairs.

We've got kids
living here,

and you're just gonna
throw us out?

How do you sleep at night?

Don't blame your miserable
goddamn lives on me.

Indistinct chatter

Okay, listen up.

Some of you have inquired
about our petition.

We have demanded that
Lincoln Grove high school

offer programs
for special students

to help them fit in
with their classmates.

Applause

- Aren't you glad we came?
- Yeah.

Great, also concerning
the "R" word,

we have demanded
a school policy

forbidding students and faculty
from using that word.

- Retard.
- Excuse me.

Retard.
You can't even say it.

So how do we talk about it?

We all know your opinion
on this, Jeremy.

But right now
I'm the one speaking.

Brothers and sisters,

words only have power
if we give them power.

We must take back
the word "retard."

Make it ours.

Sweetheart, the rest of us
find the word offensive.

I'm not your sweetheart,
bitch.

All gasp

Mrs. Kandage,
I know you mean well,

but many of us here
think it's time

that we reclaim
and redefine the word.

And since normies
don't get called "retard,"

they don't have
a say in this.

Normies do not get a say.

What's a "normie?"

I think it's slang
for non-retards.

- Hey, Fabio, do you mind?
- Sorry.

I don't care how it's used.

I don't want anybody calling
my son that word ever.

It's incredibly hurtful.

Even if we did get rid of it,

someone will just think up
another way of saying it.

That's right.
The queers took back their word.

- It's different.
- How is it different?

It's not like
race issues disappear

if people stop saying nigger.

Shut the fuck up!

I can say it, you can't.

Retards,
we must ban together.

The way to get respect
is to take respect,

and normies can help us
get that message out.

Raise your hand
if you're with us!

Yeah.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

All: Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

You digging that smell?

Did something die in here?

A couple thousand somethings.

- It gets better after awhile.
- How?

Your brain
sort of short-circuits,

shuts off your sense of smell.

Tape everything up,
gloves and boots.

We got solids in there today.

Solids?

Maggots, roaches,
rats, flies.

You got roaches
inside your suit

going crazy, running all over
your short hairs,

hard to focus on work.

Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God.

Keep your mouth shut,
and I don't mean shut up.

I mean, don't let anything
splash in your mouth.

Your girlfriend
gonna be okay?

Thank you, everyone,
for sharing.

Have a good day.

Groans

Great meeting.

I just need to get
my slip signed for the court.

Okay.

Let's see.

I guess we'll see you twice
a week for at least six months.

Keep coming back, Frank.

As if I had a fucking choice.

- Congratulations.
- What?

I said congratulations.

During group share you said
you're two years sober,

unless I misunderstood.

No, that's right.
Two years today.

Oh, only six weeks for me.

It hasn't been easy.

I was downing
cleaning products, mouthwash.

- You ever try Sterno?
- Love Sterno.

It's ridiculous
what passes for alcoholism

with this group.

Her two-hour blackout?

I mean, come on.

I blacked out a year.

Am I whining about it?

Or the guy that lost his job
and banged his sister-in-law?

Where I come from,
that's Friday night.

Both chuckle

But you've been sober
two years.

That's amazing.

But it's because
you don't need booze

to fill the gaping hole
in your life.

It's about being
in the moment.

A meatball sub.

A Bears game
on the television.

Simple pleasures.

Simple pleasures, right.

Frank,
I'm Chris or Christopher.

I hope you don't mind
if I ask.

Would you be my sponsor?

- Would I--
- Sponsor me in the program.

My previous sponsor moved out
and went to Leesburg.

That's in Florida.

Right, right.
But here's the thing.

Much as I'd love to help,

and inspiring
as I would no doubt be,

your best sponsor
is yourself.

I understand.

Take care.

Wait.

You said your last sponsor
moved out.

What, he--
what, he lived with you?

- Yeah.
- In a house?

You live in a house,
an apartment, what?

A house.

I'm sorry, let me
introduce myself properly.

I'm Frank Gallagher.

Tell me your name again.

It's Chris or Christopher.

Christopher, right.

Gags

I'm getting out.

I'm getting out.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry, but no one speaking
English as a first language

should be doing this job.

The money's good.

Not that good.

So much for
"you, me, we."

I can feel cockroaches
under my suit.

On my back!
Hit me on my back!

Hit me on my-- fuck.

Oh.

Oh, hey, these candles
are a nice idea.

- Mom brought 'em.
- Oh, she did?

Just look at me.

That's it.

Oh, shit.

You're a stud bull,
aren't you, baby?

Oh, yeah.

Hold that thought.
Mom!

Jump in between us.
Hurry up.

Wasn't sure
when to bring this up,

but maybe I could use
a little warm-up this time.

Warming up,
like a jog around the block?

'Cause if you're asking Kev
to go down on you,

I can tell you right now
that is not happening.

Women are more likely to
conceive if they have an orgasm.

I read it in Cosmo.

It pulls the sperm up into--

The conversation is
not happening on this end,

just saying.

- Hey, sorry I bailed.
- Don't be sorry.

I'm sure tons of guys would
leave their girlfriends alone

to shovel blood and shit.

I went down to the coffee
beanery and got a job.

How much per hour?

I mean, you know, not
as much as the cleaning posse,

but all the coffee
you can drink.

- Full-time?
- Close.

- How close?
- Part-time.

There are opportunities
for advancement.

The manager was saying--

We've reconvened
the Cousin Patrick war council.

No luck on the legal front?

No, it turns out
it's pretty hard to prove

that someone had dementia
when they signed a will.

In our case,
very fucking hard.

Because she was already dead.

- What was option two again?
- We're on three now.

Convince Patrick to back off.

Or option four,
kill Patrick.

Back to three.
Convince him how?

We get my brothers to go
around and scare him a little.

No way.

Enough with
the brothers Milkovich.

Nothing fatal.

Hit him with a bat
a couple of times,

a little pistol whipping.

They'll want $500 for it,

but if I help Mickey
move some meth next week,

they'll settle for $200.

That's a discount beating.

What do you say?

Guys, we can't--

We need a house.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll be scraping blood and shit

from under my fingernails,

and then I'll be at V's
getting drunk,

pretending I didn't just
order a hit on a relative.

All right.

Frank, what are you doing?

Sheila, this is Christopher.

As his AA sponsor,

I'm helping him to walk
the straight and narrow.

Well, that's nice, but how can
you be his sponsor when you--

- I said to him, "if you're
serious about recovery,

you're gonna need
24-hour-a-day oversight.

I'm just gonna have
to move in with you."

Really?

That Frank would do this,
disrupt his own life...

All I ask in return
is your sobriety.

Here, take this down
to your van.

Oh!

Nice meeting you.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Thank you, Frank.
Great job.

Never let it be said
that Frank Gallagher

outstays his welcome.

Karen, look what they gave me
when I offered to volunteer.

Pamphlets and buttons
and a banner and t-shirts.

Why don't you
come with me tomorrow?

I'm gonna have a table
outside the market.

- No thanks, mom.
- Can I ask why not?

Because they call themselves
retard nation.

It's offensive.

No, we're-- we're--

we're challenging society's
preconceptions.

This is genius.
"I am a retard."

Yeah, but read the back.

"And proud."
I'm gonna need five of these.

A lot of retards
at the Alibi.

Frank, I'm not comfortable
with how you're using that word.

Retard?
You're saying it.

Yeah, but you don't
have Down's Syndrome.

Neither do you.

I know, but my intent
is to defend free speech

and to further public
awareness and end hate.

And your intent
is simply to be rude.

Hello?

V?

Oh!

Uh, oh, sorry.

Oh.

Ahh.

Ugh, ah.

That threw me off.
Periscope down.

Hey.

Look, you need to back off
the Gallagher house.

If you don't,
you'll be sorry.

Groans

Fuck sake.

A .22?

You sure it'll stop me?

You want to find out?

What the fuck are you doing?

Get up and
knock him on his ass.

I got him covered.

I'd like you to meet the wife,
Ellen.

They're removing
the toilets.

I'll get some buckets.

I guess it didn't work out
with your brother.

Mandy, are we getting
our money back?

Minus $100.
He took a chain off Mickey.

Over there.
By the couch.

Yeah, just leave it.

Bye, honey, off to work.

Why is he leaving
a toilet in our living room?

Bye, honey!
I'm off to work!

We are so losing the house.

- I told you we are going--
- To be fine, I know.

But will we be fine here
or somewhere else?

The probate hearing
is tomorrow.

Maybe we'll get lucky.

If not, I will find us
a place to live, okay?

Please drop Liam at V's
on your way to school.

Everyone else,
grab a lunch and head out.

No truant Gallaghers today.

Hammers banging

You know, being guardian
doesn't make you super-mom.

You noticed.

I'm just saying,
it's not all on you.

Thanks.

Drill whirring

How are you this morning?

Never better.

Replacing the toilet
with a low-flow model,

much more efficient.

I bet it lowers
the water bill.

Oh, without question.

Patrick, we got off
on the wrong foot.

Sending Mickey Milkovich over
with a baseball bat, hmm?

Is that the foot you mean?

If we let you take the house,
will you rent it to us?

Sure.

Call it $1,800 a month,

first, last, and deposit.

You know we don't have
that kind of--

No?

I thought living in squalor
was a lifestyle choice.

It's just that when we first
started this with mom,

we approached it
like a medical procedure,

but these last few times,
is it me

or was she acting
like she was on a date?

She always dresses nice.

Musk perfume,
gold tips.

When has she ever worn gold tips
to our house, Kev?

Like I'd notice.

So you have no idea
what I'm talking about?

Baby, maybe she made
an extra effort.

Aha!

What's wrong with that?

Low-cut dress,
"fuck-me" pumps.

Maybe she's excited
to have a grandchild,

wants me to be
properly motivated.

And that doesn't
freak you out?

This whole thing
freaks me out,

and I'm trying
not to think about it.

I'm like
a professional athlete.

If I think, it affects
my performance.

My job is to not think.

Fuck! Fuck!

If you're gonna
follow me to work,

how about giving me a ride?

Not your chauffeur, bro.

Don't burn the milk.

It's not good
when you burn it.

Jim!

Andy from med school.

I'm at County General
down the street.

No kidding.

Good to see you.

I love this place.
Great coffee.

You're a working man now, huh?

Oh, management trainee.

You know, they won't let you
buy a franchise

till you run
one of their stores.

Nice.

I hear these places
are a gold mine.

What can I get you, man?

Hey, you know Adam britt,
Nick Stathis, Mark?

They're all doing
residencies in Chicago.

Nick's ortho,
Mark's a surgeon.

We're grabbing dinner
tomorrow night.

You should join us.

Yeah, sounds fun.

But I'm not sure if I can.

They would love to see you.
You gotta come.

Um, double cappuccino
with non-fat.

I was gonna wait
for the landlord,

but somebody already
kicked the door in for us.

That's considerate.

At least
it's in our price range.

Barely.

Well, it's not like we live
in the Gold Coast now.

Place just needs some paint,
a case of roach motels.

Down the road,
maybe we save some money

and find a house
back in our old hood.

Need a crack pipe?

Better not touch that.

Touch it?
I'm ready to smoke out of it.

I guess I'll call the landlord
and tell him we'll take it.

Retches

I need you to watch
your baby brother.

And who's that puking
on his Timberlands?

Cousin Patrick.

He's got nausea,
shortness of breath,

blood in urine,
severe illness, and death.

What the hell
are you reading?

Rat poison.

Hi! Hi!

We are Retard Nation.

Yeah, we're
a local organization,

but as the name suggests,
we are going national.

We're promoting the idea
that people with Down's Syndrome

need to reclaim
their own identities

in order to define themselves.

So if you'd like to,
you can make a donation

or if you'd like to buy
a t-shirt or just get signed--

What the hell is this?

Well, we're a local
organization, Retard Nation--

Take it down now.

Sir, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

Lady, you're not gonna stand
in front of my market

with this goddamn sign.

Pack it up now or I'll do it,
all right?

Sir, we will not
be intimidated by normies.

- By what?
- By normies.

Goddamn it,
get this crap out of here.

- Don't!
- All of it.

- Ma'am, I'm very sorry--
- Don't!

Do not touch me
in front of my market.

This is hate speech.
Get your hands off of me.

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation.

So this is it.

It's only a one-bedroom,
but I'm at work a lot.

- Christopher.
- Yeah, Frank?

In order
for the healing to begin,

it's important
that you be honest

and tell me
where you hide your booze.

Under the cushions?
Back of the closet?

I know all the tricks.

I threw it out.

Do you mind if I look around
in case you missed a bottle?

Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

Where do you work?

I'm a vet tech for the city.

I deal with
stray cats and dogs.

Meaning you kill them?

In veterinary parlance,
it's called "control."

Sometimes I rescue
a beauty like Bessie there.

It makes me feel better
about it all.

Hey, I've got
a surprise for you.

Why don't I grab it?

- What sort of surprise?
- You'll see!

Hey.

You know your dog is dead,
right?

Taxidermy
is a hobby of mine.

Sighs

So when you say rescue,

you mean bring them home
and stuff them,

because most people
when they used that word--

Meatball subs!

Like you said, remember?

Simple pleasures.

Living in the moment.

Sounds like something
I would say.

You mentioned
you're a Bears fan.

There's no game on, but I've got
last season's highlights.

You eat, I'll cue it up.

You want a blanket?

It's kind of chilly.

I have a new respect
for baristas.

It turns out it's
a highly demanding craft.

Who knew?

You keep burning the shit
out of your--

what's up?

Tell him.

I killed Patrick.

What?

Option four. Kill Patrick.

Why skip an option?

The whole life in prison
thing, sweetheart.

I realize you've had sketchy
parental role models, okay?

But as your
newly appointed guardian,

can we agree that
offing people is not cool?

Can we get on
the same page with that?

Yeah.

If this comes back to us,

if we get charged
with homicide,

do you realize
how serious that is?

What?

Liam.

Oh, Liam.

Oh, got him in time.

We need to come up
with an explanation

in case the cops
tie this to us.

Like we have rats and
Carl threw poison everywhere.

- That works.
- It does?

Anyone who knows you
will know it's not far-fetched.

Debbie, go get everyone so
we can get our story straight.

Okay.

I'm raising a sociopath.

I'm sure that your cousin
went to the hospital,

so he'll probably live.
Hopefully.

Mandy,
I thought that was you.

What the fuck you doing here?

Re-enrolling.

So I know you're seeing Lip,

but like I told him,
I think it's great.

You talked to Lip?

I came by last Tuesday
to say hi.

I didn't come inside.

Lip didn't want me inside,

because, you know,
he didn't want to upset you.

Why would I be upset?

Oh, you wouldn't.

Forget it.

I just meant
I'm happy for you guys.

Latte.

Wait till you try
these pancakes.

Organic blueberries.

You're adjusting very well
for an addict.

Thanks to you, sponsor.

If it weren't for you,

this place would be littered
with whiskey bottles.

What was
your drink of choice?

Terry's.

Never heard of that.

Terry's, uh,
malted whiskey.

You mean malt whiskey?
Like single malt?

Well, all kinds of malt.

Get up in the morning
and drink a full keg of beer.

Man, was that bad.

A keg is 15 gallons.

I didn't know better,

I would think
you're making stuff up.

Our relationship is based
on honesty, Christopher.

I tried to drink alcohol.

I just don't like the taste.

Jesus Christ!
You're not an alcoholic?

Forgive me.

Well, then why go to AA?
Why have me as your sponsor?

Please, Frank,
please, don't move out.

Everything is going
so good with us.

I won't lie to you again.

I promise.

I'll make us prime rib.

Groans

Last night of mom's
ovulation cycle, thank God.

She just needs to screw Kev
and not enjoy it.

That's not unreasonable.

That's what every daughter
wants from her mother.

What time is it?

3:15 and still no Patrick.

We don't want him to come,
do we?

It's kind of a toss-up.

If he does show,
the judge gives our house away.

If he doesn't,
he's probably dead,

so we get to keep the house
until we all go to prison.

The estate
of Ginger Gallagher.

Here we go.

Guys.

Cough

What now?
Start packing?

Fiona said that you guys
found a place to rent.

Did you take any photos?

You're kidding.

You're serious.

You knew Karen was in town,
didn't you?

I heard that, yeah.

You heard it.

I saw her.

Saw her or fucked her?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I don't want to be
somewhere that I'm not wanted,

so man up, tell me.

I have a problem
with you being here.

You act like
we had a conversation,

never happened.

That I said that it was okay
for you to leave your stuff here

and show up uninvited, do my
laundry, and act like my wife.

But we-- we never
had that conversation,

did we?

I never asked you to be here.

I don't fucking
deserve this.

You found
a new house for rent?

That's great.

Landlord says
it's ours if we want it.

New school?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I never should
have let this happen.

I'm so sorry.

I'm kind of sick
of this place anyway.

Nice to have a change.

Techno music

Speaking portuguese

Hey.

Going out tonight with
some medical school friends.

Totally upstanding citizens.
You wanna give me a ride?

- I'm not your chauffeur.
- "Not your chauffeur," right.

So you'd rather me
take the El train,

make you get out of your car
to follow me.



Chicago and La Salle.



Don't you look nice.

Yes, she does.

I brought some rose

and some more candles
and some CDs.

You like D'Angelo, Kevie?

You know, a little music
to set the mood.

It's great you want
to set the mood, mama.

It's just Kev and I want
to keep this straight forward,

more like a procedure.

As opposed to what?

- A date.
- Excuse me?

I'm not some whore who comes
over in a raggedy t-shirt,

has relations with
your boyfriend, and leaves.

If we gonna do this,

we might as well
get some ambiance up in here.

Otherwise,
get some trashy thing

won't mind if you bend her
over the kitchen table.

She didn't mean it
like that, mama.

Is this happening or not?

I want to hear my CD.

Knocking at door

Come in.

Oh.

Not who I was expecting.

That guy in New York, he, uh,
he really take your money?

Think I would lie
about that?

Well, why not?

It'll make everyone feel bad
for you, lower their guard.

Poor Karen, back home
with her tail between her legs.

That's right.

It's all an act.

You talk to Mandy?

Who?

Oh, Mandy, right.

Yeah, at school.

Kind of a skank,
don't you think?

So you dropped napalm
on my relationship

without even getting
your hands dirty.

Well, it's not like
you lost your touch.

What do you want?

Take your clothes off.

Horns honking

Hey!

Hey!

You think
that t-shirt's funny?

No.
No, it's-- it's political.

It's actually pro-tard.

Yeah?
Well, tell that to my sister.

Oh, shit.

Nice.

Ooh, that's it, baby,
that's it.

Ooh, ooh, yeah.

Ooh.

Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

Ooh, that's it.

Ooh, bring it home.

Bring it home, baby.

Ooh, yeah.

Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

Stop!

Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

You people want to have
a baby, beautiful.

Find another way to do it.

I can't be working
under these conditions.

All right,
we'll call you.

Moaning

Karen, honey,
can you come down?

- Don't stop.
- I wasn't planning on it.

Karen,
Mrs. Wong is here.

Oh, come on in.

Timmy saw you
at the supermarket.

Oh, oh, that's just my
volunteer work for Hymie's sake.

- You have to stop that shit.
- Gasps Excuse me?

Timmy saw you fight
with that man.

He's embarrassed for you.

Well, I don't know
if it's a cultural thing

and you're not aware,
but you're being rude right now.

Jody, can you help Mrs. Wong
with the crib?

You act crazy.

I can't leave
the baby with you.

What about you trying to cure
him with your Chinese herbs?

I mean, you need to accept him
for who he is.

No more baby.

Let me know which car's yours.
I'll load it up for you.

She's hoarding Hymie.

What?

Okay, I won't volunteer
anymore if that's what you want.

You promise?

I promise.

I bring the baby tomorrow,

but I stay to watch you.

Okay.

Blue Impala.

Okay.

Your Karen is right.

This is not a good place
for baby.

Karen? My--

when did you talk to Karen?

What kind of a creep
uses Alcoholics Anonymous

to cater
to his nefarious agenda?

It is a slap in the face

to everyone
who attends the program.

Nice shirt, Frank.

Not that we didn't know.

Laughter

So he doesn't need
a sponsor.

But he lets you live there
rent-free, and he's feeding you?

It doesn't add up,
does it?

Well, if I were you,
I'd make sure

that he's not a rapist
or a serial killer.

I mean,
you said he's a loner, right?

Super neat?
I bet he's got hardwood floors.

So?

Carpets get bloodstains.

What's he do for a living?

He kills animals,
occasionally stuffs them.

He what?

It's called "animal control"
in veterinary parlance.

It's called he's
Jeffrey fucking Dahmer, dude.

He finds a guy
no one will miss,

gets them to move in with him,
pumps them full of vet drugs.

He's gonna drill
a hole in your head

and turn you
into his zombie sex slave.

Before we get carried away,

Christopher
had a sponsor before me.

The guy moved to Florida.

Oh, he moved to Florida.

And who told you that,
Christopher?

Christopher.

Be careful, Frank.

You're gonna wake up

and find your dick
in a ziploc in his freezer.

 I wanna have
the world at my feet

 I need to know

 just how sweet
is sweet

 I'm gonna take my kicks
as they come

 yeah,
I'm gonna have some fun

 I want to be
high up on top

 I've got no choice

 I just can't stop

Fiona!

What's going on?

I've got Patrick Gallagher
outside with an eviction notice.

You're throwing us out?

This was supposed to take
a couple of weeks.

Normally.
The guy seems like an asshole.

I'm trying to chill him out,

but he's made
a couple accusations.

He said you tried to kill him.

That's ridiculous.

He has a toxicology report
from the hospital.

He says he won't press charges
if you move out tonight.

He can't be serious.

He seems to be serious.

But Patrick loves me.

Yeah, well,
is there a place you can go?

Tonight?
No.

Patrick gave me candy.

Debs, go get Lip and Ian,
please.

And then he got
in bed with me

and touched me
in my nice places.

What was that?

About candy
or Patrick touching me?

Patrick Gallagher?

Mm-hmm.

And when you say
"nice places"?

Uh, private places.

Frank?

Aw, fuck.

Frank?

Frank.
Frank.

Frank.

Frank.

Aghh!
Get away from me!

These people are witnesses.

Where have you been?

I've been looking
all over for you.

What do you want?

Are you all right?
Have you had a relapse?

Don't touch me.

I could be your sponsor.
I'm not a drinker,

but I've been to so many
meetings, I know the procedure.

No!
No, no, thank you.

I'm sorry
if I freaked you out.

I'm not real good with,
well, with people, really.

It was great
having someone to talk to.

Get a room, assholes.

I'm sorry, Frank.

See you around.

Wait, wait.

You're not gonna stuff me
or drill a hole in my head?

What?

Your interest in me is not
of a perverse or sexual nature?

No,
nothing like that.

I mean, if you're saying
you want to have sex with me,

I guess I'd do my best.

What happened
to your old sponsor?

Either he's in Florida,

or he's avoiding me,
thinks I'm creepy,

being clingy and all,
and lonely.

So basically
the problem is you're clingy.

What's for dinner
at your place?

Rib eyes.

But we stop at the liquor
store, and you're paying?

- Anything you want.
- Let's go.

Really?
You mean it?

Oh, clingy
is a walk in the park.

Here, have it.

- I really like her.
- Yeah?

She's a poet.

Karen.

Oh, mom,
you scared me.

You told me you
came home to be with Hymie,

but you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Why would you do that?

I missed you, mom.

So it's true.

Everything was better
before Hymie came along,

just you and me.

I wanted us back.

I love you.

You're shitting me.

Standard police procedure, sir.

We'll have to meet
the sex crimes detectives

- at the station, unless--
- Unless what?

- The charges are dropped.
- Charges are--?

400 a month rent,
no deposit.

Are you in on this?

I'm not in on anything, sir.

I am, however, gonna make
a radio call from the car.

You can take your 400
and shove it up your ass.

I remember your hands
touching me and--

- $1,200.

You said it was
our little secret.

I knew it was wrong.

Jesus, what--

900, final offer.

500, no deposit.

I need a 50-year lease,
and I want that in writing.

Groans

Hey, check it out.

Left a poison sandwich
in the crawl space.

- Don't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

Ugh, too late.

Why the outpouring
of affection?

We didn't lose the house.

I was molested.
It all worked out.

- What?
- We can stay.

I put your toothbrush
back in the cup.

Want an eye mask?

Curtains let
a lot of light in.

Thanks.

- Night, Frank.
- Good night, Christopher.

I'm going to bed, babe.

All right,
I'll be up in a second.

Text alert

Who's that?

- Carol.
- My mother?

My mother is texting you at 1:30
in the fucking morning?

Shit, that's not funny, is it?

I'm just playing.

It's Kate calling in sick
for her shift tomorrow.

I'm sorry, baby.

Rock music





Don't know where the fuck
you were last week,

but here's what you
missed on Shameless.

They're digging out
the sewer main in a few days

and shutting the water off.

What about Aunt Ginger?

Let me spell this out for you.

The city digs up some bones,
the police show up.

You buried a body and you stole
from the Federal Government.

You will never
get out of prison.

"My dad is gay
for your brother" thing,

it's, like, on film loop
in my brain.

I'll be back for dinner.
Buck up, kiddo.

No biggie,
just my universe falling apart.

We are literally
digging up a body.

Walk away.

Yeah, why don't you go cry
to your gay dad about it?

Hey, what did the doc
say this morning?

I need to know the truth.
Can I have a damn baby or not?

What about a surrogate?

You two take it from me
when it comes out.

Yes, mama.

It will be our child.
It will be your grandchild.

You know the guy
you beat the shit out of?

He wants me to sneak
into his mansion

and take all of his crap.

Don't know what you see
in that geriatric viagroid.

He isn't afraid to kiss me.

I can take care of you at home.

No, you can't.

Get in the car.
Debbie, get in the car.

I love you, Debbie!

Operator, can you connect me
with Child Welfare Services?

I would like to report
a negligent situation.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Britney Sturgess
from Child Protective Services.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Train horn blaring

Dog barking

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, what the hell's going on?

Department of Family Services
is taking us away.

They what?
Can they do that?

It won't last, Debs.
I promise.

What was it last time?
A week?

Nine days.

Aw, 20 bucks says
we're back in five.

Can I get their placement
addresses from you now?

Not until the intake interviews
with the children are complete.

Who reported us?

Engine starting

Come on! Who was it?

Sighs

Frank.

Footsteps approaching

Frank. Frank.

Frank.

I'm off to my
hypnotherapy appointment.

I need you to watch Hiram.

I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Sheils.

Where's Jody?

He's working
at the tattoo parlor.

Marking idiots with ink so the
rest of us can recognize them.

Frank, you have tattoos.

Point well taken.

So-- and if you're
doing laundry,

can you put some
of Hymie's onesie's in?

Might as well.
You're both covered in pee-pee.

Hushed laughter

Shushes

There you go, buddy.

I just want you to know that

my dumping you
and leaving town...

is in no way a reflection of my
feelings toward you, Hiram.

I just gotta lay low
a little bit

in case they find Ginger's body
in my backyard.

Exhales

Sighs

Plates clattering

Oh, shit!
I got a shift in ten minutes.

Yeah, go to your shift.
I'll take care of this.

I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

Yeah.
I wasn't either.

I'm gonna see if I can get
one of the evil cock gobblers

to cover my shift
so I can get over to the DFS

and start tracking down
the kids.

You guys okay?

Oh, yeah.

Ain't our first time
at the rodeo.

'Cause Liam's still cute
and little...

Babbling

He'll go to some loving home
with people

who really want a family,
but waited so long

their egg batter rotted so they
can't have one of their own.

And Debbie can Carl will
be placed together because...

Because the State always tries
to keep siblings together.

And Lip and I can handle
whatever foster nut jobs

we end up with.

Remember that last guy
with the, uh...

was it the fucking
bathroom peephole?

Oh, yeah.

Well, this time's gonna
be a little different.

I've placed Liam
and Carl together,

but Debbie unfortunately
has to be placed separately.

All by myself?

And, Philip and Ian,
you're too old to be placed,

so you're going
to a group home.

Like a whore's period.
Late again, bitch.

You're wasting
your talents, Patty.

You should be tweeting
this crap.

Knocks on door

You're late.

I know. I'm sorry.

Look, I kind of have
a family emergency

and was wondering if I could
skip my shift today?

Would you look at this?
It's filthy.

My back is filthy.
'Cause you haven't washed it.

So why should I wash yours?

Look, I just need
a couple hours

to get to the Department
of Family Services.

They yanked my brothers
and sister from our house

this morning, and I just gotta

find out where they are
and make sure they're safe

and not with any psychos
or anything, please.

Sorry, but if you can't get
anyone to cover your shift...

You know as well as I do
none of these bitches

are gonna cover for me.

I still have that video
of you and I have no problem

sending it to your wife.

Yeah, and I have no problem
going to DFS to tell them

you steal from the register
and show up high every day.

Your word against mine.

Actually, the girls
will back me up.

And I'm gonna want you to quit

so I don't have to
pay you unemployment.

Fuck you, Bobby.

Tell you what, you, uh,
tickle the balls a little bit

and maybe I'll write you
a letter of recommendation.

It really puts the "home"
in "group home."

Baby babbling

Dog barking in distance

It's only gonna
be a couple days, okay?

Every Gallagher
can handle that, right?

- I'll take care of Liam.
- Yes, you will.

Hey, Debs.

See you soon, all right?

Hey.

Good day, gentlemen.

My name is d'Andre
and this is Gunderson House,

a Level 14 boys group home
housing underage D&Ds

in the Chicago system.

Is that "Dungeons and Dragons"?

"Delinquents and deviants."
Follow me.

This will be your primary
residence until we figure out

which one you are.

Your wallets and cell phones
will be in my care

until you've proven to me
that you can follow the rules.

- So it's like prison?
- It's up to you.

You will be given an opportunity
to earn back your money

and your cell phone privileges.

Gee, thanks.

You would do well
to shut your mouth

and keep your eyes open
in here.

Clears throat

The county database says that
you're available for placement,

but I'm concerned there are
too many children in your care.

I'm sure there's
some kind of limit.

Kids talking indistinctly

These ain't cats, honey.
They're kids.

They need someone
to take care of them.

That's why the Good Lord
put me here.

So I can take in all his babies
don't nobody else want.

Laughs

Come here, sweetheart.

Come on,
I'm not gonna bite you.

Laughs

You're a blessing.

Mama Kamala
is truly blessed to have you.

Yup.

It's only for a few days.
I'll be okay.

Um, this is my number.

If you have any questions
or, you know, if you just

want to talk about anything,
you can call me any time, okay?

Okey-dokey.

Bye-bye, now.

Rule number one.

No sitting on
the good furniture.

This is the good furniture?

Rule number two.
No sassing. You hear me?

Let me look inside that bag.
Give me that bag.

Make sure you ain't got nothing
in there to get you in trouble.

Why are you standing there
eyeballing me?

Get busy minding them kids.

Hi.
I'm Debbie.

Laronda.

You ain't getting
your bags back.

I know.

And what's your name?

We want to be completely
honest with you, Carl.

We have been looking
to adopt a bi-racial baby

for quite some time.

And when they called about Liam,
we were over the moon.

And then the State
told us about you.

And we want to try
to keep you two together.

So let's give
this foursome a try.

Which one are you again?

I'm Cassius and this is Lanier.

So you guys are gay?

- Yup.
- Yes.

Does, like, shit ever get
stuck on the tip of your dick?

Yeah.

Uh...

Gallagher?

I was hoping to see Marilyn.

She's been our caseworker
the last couple of years.

Well, the turnover rate
in our field is quite high.

It's really a wonder Marilyn
lasted as long as she did.

So how can I help you?

You can give me the addresses
where the kids were placed.

I already told you,
I can't give out any information

about the case until
the intakes are complete.

Come on. Marilyn always
used to give me the info,

just so I can know
they're okay,

and can get them stuff,
like books or clothes,

or whatever.

Well, that is a clear
violation of policy

on Marilyn's part.

Hey. I know
you think you're helping,

but as someone who
has been in and out

of the system their whole life,

I can tell you
it's a nightmare.

These kids have a big sister
who loves them,

and I just want
to make sure they're okay.

So give me something, Britney.

I mean, break a goddamn rule.

I can tell you
that I placed two together

in one foster home,
and the girl in another.

And the two older boys
are in a group home.

The one on Hester?

No. They're in
a Level 14 on Richmond.

Thanks.

Hey, if I can find one family
willing to take in all the kids,

could they be placed together?

In theory, yes.

- Stella been in yet?
- What's with the bag?

Uh, going fishing
for a couple of days.

I heard Stella's
pulling a long haul

up to northern Canada.

Hoping to hitch a ride.

Fishing? You gonna use
your tiny dick as a worm?

I've caught some big whales
with this little worm,

yourself included there, Moby.

Hello, Stella.
How are you, sunshine?

- What the hell do you want?
- Oh, you know, same as you.

Free pussy
and a life on the road.

- Could I hitch a ride?
- Where you headed?

Anywhere but here.

- Kill somebody?
- No, no, no.

But I did bury her.

Could always use some company.

I'll meet you here
tomorrow morning

before I pick up my load.

A couple of boilermakers
to take the edge off

the long haul, huh?

I don't drink before I drive.

I end up ramming
smart cars in the ass

just for shits and giggles.

DFS took the kids this morning.

Oh, shit.

You think you and Kevin could
talk to your foster caseworker

about taking them in?

- Five Gallaghers in my house?
- Just for a couple days.

A week, maximum.

Lip and Ian got placed
in a Level 14 group home.

Level 14?

For kids that light
their parents on fire,

or stab them in the face while
they're napping on the couch.

Well, you're over 21 now.

Can't they just
release them to you?

I'd have to file
for guardianship.

Groans Five Gallaghers.

I'm gonna be the lone black dot
on a map of Ireland.

You been
in a group home before?

It's always like this?

No, last place I was in
was an actual home.

This is more like
a fucking labor camp.

Yo, give me your cash.

- What?
- Give me your cash.

Now. Come on.

Hey, Salvador, check it out.

It's that chick
from the movie Brave.

- He your boyfriend?
- No. Brother.

I'm Lip.
This is Ian.

We don't want any trouble,
all right?

We're just passing through.

Long as you show respect,
you're gonna be fine.

You're like
a fucking cockroach.

Cries

Grunts

Sighs

Door opens

- Jimmy?
- Darker.

- Hey. Talk to your caseworker?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

Two reasons why we can't
take in your brood.

One. The fact
that you had a foster child

in your home that ran away
under your "supervision."

Two. Technically, the
investigation's still pending

as to the quality of your care.

The quality of my care?

You're saying her running away
is my fault?

Oh, you know what?

Do not get all up in my grill,
sister girl, okay?

Well, it was worth a shot.

Now what?

Gotta kick it into high gear.

Figure out where
the kids are staying.

Get the house ready
for home inspection.

They're gonna require a fit
parent to get the kids back,

so I'm hoping to find Monica

so I don't have to deal
with Frank.

Why does it always
come down to Frank?

Sighs

Carl, it's dinner time.

Carl?

Where is that boy?

Oh, I'm gonna
pound your fucking hole.

Yeah. Oh, that fucker's
going up your ass.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Why don't you
get those pants off

so I can eat your fucking hole?

Why do they
all have moustaches?

Out. Now.

That was an invasion of our
privacy and we won't have it.

You are not to touch things
that don't belong to you.

Now sit down.

Am I allowed
to touch the chair?

Don't be smart.

- What the hell is this?
- Kale, brown rice, and tofu.

Your body is a temple, Carl,

and you only want to put
things in it that are natural.

Like fists?

I saw it in that movie.

maybe know where
my mom might be?

Your daughter.

Monica.

Yup.
Yeah, I figured.

But I just thought I'd try.

Okay. Thanks.

Now what?

With no Monica,
I kind of have no choice.

I gotta find Frank.

Get him sober and ready
to appear in court.

Chuckles

He's like
my sad-ass Obi Wan Kenobi.

I can help you with that.

That's a pretty
nice offer considering

how much of a dick
I was to you about your dad.

No, you're always a dick.

Seriously, I don't mean
to be an asshole.

It's just... genetic.

Yeah. You're not wrong.

I need to suck it up
about my dad being gay...

and a liar.

And I need to get over it.
And I am.

I'm good.

Silver lining?

Huh?

Finally have the house
to ourselves.

I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling it.

You mind if we just lay here?

Yeah.
Yeah, sounds nice.

What is this stuff?

It's pus from
your mother's monkey.

Thought you liked
the taste of that.

What's your problem, dude?

Nick, Salvador,
find another table.

Come on, chop-chop.

Proof of your employment
came through,

so you go to work today.

I need your employer
to sign this, times in and out.

Understand?

You know, I'm actually
pretty excited to get out there.

- Start looking for work.
- Nice try.

You have court-mandated
community service hours you owe.

Yeah, but only a few.

Then I can get out there
and start looking for work,

so I can become
a contributing member

of our great,
capitalistic society.

You think you're better
than everyone here, don't you?

Oh, that's--
that's rhetorical, right?

I mean, you don't actually
want me to answer that, do you?

Cute. See, I could
smack you across the face.

But I think it's better
I get out of your way.

Let life bend you over instead.

Dude thinks he's in
an episode ofScared Straight.

Ethel really
fucked up our kid credit.

Yup.

Now we can't even
get a foster kid?

- Anybody can get a foster kid.
- I think it's a sign.

Jerry Sandusky could
probably get a foster kid.

It's a sign
we need to step it up

in the surrogate department.

Look, we just did
the baster thing with your mom.

Let's just see if it works.

Mama always pukes the morning
after she gets knocked up.

As a kid, it was like watching
someone take ipecac,

you could set your watch by it.

My super "spermazoa"
too much for her?

Spermatozoa.
I don't think it worked.

We need to try something else.

Frank?

God damn it, did you
sleep here last night?

Guilty.

Stella here yet?

Oh, come on.
I'm not helping you up.

Get up.

As of right now,
you are officially on the wagon.

DFS made a surprise appearance
and the kids got pulled.

It's time for your
father-of-the-year act.

Oh, my God.
Are they all right?

I'll tell you what.

Let's meet back at the house
and we'll get this all settled.

Looks heavy.

Why don't I carry this
back to the house for you?

But I need it for some errands
I'm going to run a little--

Back at the house now,

or you'll lose your kids
and the welfare checks

that come with them.

I go to the house,
the city finds Ginger's body.

I'm toast.

I found Ginger
and I tossed her bones.

You're safe.

Oh. That's great.

Not for you.

You don't do exactly as I say,
and I'll rat you out

about Aunt Ginger's checks
and your fake disability.

- You don't have the balls.
- Jesus Christ!

I need you to do this!
Can you just do this?

I'm sorry.
Did you just say you need me?

Yes! I need you
to get your shit together

and get the kids back.

Well, seeing as how
you need something from me,

maybe I need something
from you.

For starters,
I would like to be shown

the respect which I deserve.

I believe
I'm already doing that.

And this one
is non-negotiable.

I want free roam
of my own house.

Fine.

We're gonna go visit Lip
and Ian in the group home.

God knows what they've been
dealing with in that shithole.

And then we go
find your lawyer.

He has a lawyer?

Don't worry, Liam.

Soon as I steal
enough stuff from these guys,

we're outta here.

Rock music playing in car

I spent some time here.

That summer mom was sent away
for knifing a poodle.

- Hey! I missed you guys.
- Oh, yeah!

- How you holding up?
- Aw, we're fine.

The place is a joke.

They still serving
that rotten porridge?

He already on the wagon?

Oh, why do you
have to say that?

As of right now.
You out on furlough?

No, I've gotta work.
He's gotta finish parole hours.

You guys want a lift?

No, we gotta get our bus
passes signed by the driver.

- You find Debs and the boys?
- Not yet, but I will.

Do you need anything?
You need cash? Clothes?

No, no. Look, don't
worry about us, we're fine.

Worry about him.

Where's my hug?

I'll wash, you dry.

Okay, um, take over.

Come on, come on.

I mean, there's
just no privacy.

If I wanna jack-off,
I gotta do it in the bathroom.

Can't even begin to imagine
what a pussy you'd be in juvie.

Laughs

You fuck anyone in there yet?

God, no.

Wise choice.

Even if you're propositioned,
it's probably just a setup.

Guys want to find out
if you're gay

and pound the shit outta you.

And not in a good way.

Great.

Hey, my dad took my brothers
on a run out of town

for a couple days,
so you wanna ditch that dump

and crash at my place, you can.

Was I just invited
to a sleepover?

Fuck you,
is what you were invited to.

Laughs

Fiona here?
She's not home.

Are you okay?

Did you foster parents hurt you?
'Cause I will--

- No. We ran away.
- Honey, you can't stay here.

The police will
come looking for you.

We're with these
two gay robot guys

and they keeping talking about
how they want to swipe Liam.

Honey, you gotta go back.

I know what it's like to have
a foster kid run away on me.

Come on, I'll take you.

What if they really
want to keep Liam?

The only reason why
they would want to keep him

is if they want him,
so be sure that they don't.

Be creative.

Can you at least
hold some of my stuff?

What stuff?

Clattering

Jesus, Lou!
Laughs When did that happen?

- It's not mine.
- Get to the point, Frank.

Who's this?

My daughter and her girlfriend.

- Who's in trouble?
- DFS snatched my kids.

- I need you to get them back.
- Catch?

I have no money and no promise
of any coming my way

any time soon.

Okay.

First order of business,
you need to get your ass to DFS.

You need to file a petition
to reinstate custody

and you're gonna need to dig up

that useless wife
of yours, Monica.

It's always better
to have signatures

from two shitty parents
instead of one.

What if we can't find her?

Well, find someone
that looks like her.

And you're gonna need her
to take parenting classes.

And I'm gonna go ahead
and get the case filed.

And then I'll see you
at the hearing.

In the meantime,
no drugs, no booze.

No poppy seed bagels.

I need your piss clean
and your eyes white.

Thanks for the phone call.

You know how hard it is
to find a public phone?

Ian managed.

Then I had to track your ass
down through the city.

Sorry, I've been busy.

Molly's mom showed up
at my house.

- Oh, she's still alive?
- Turns out Molly's a runner.

What, you just
let her take her?

Oh, I was supposed to stop her?

I don't know,
if she ran it was probably

for a good reason, no?

Or not. I used to run away
all the time when I was little.

My point exactly.

My dad's out of town
for a few days

and I told Mickey
he could have the place.

Can I stay with you?

I got to play it straight
in this group home for a bit.

Maybe I can sneak you in
tonight though.

Promise I won't get gang raped?

Nope.

Whatever, I'm in.

Why are you eating candy
before dinner?

'Cause it says here that dark
chocolate has an amino acid

that doubles your sperm count.

I didn't read that one,
but mama says

asparagus and garlic
does the trick, so tah-dah.

If I eat all that, my piss
is gonna stink for a month.

And mama's
bringing over oysters.

But we gotta think
of a better delivery system

than the turkey baster.

- Here.

And Weston.

Weston!

Here.

All right, good night,
you shits of Chicago!

Pricks of Illinois!

Have fun.

How did you get
the private room?

I made some friends.

Is this what it's gonna be like

when you sneak me
into your dorm in college?

A little different.

I'm guessing my dorm mates
would be literate.

You are out of your mind.

Have you seen
that fucking ponytail?

It's a powerful ponytail, man.
That's bullshit.

It keeps the skin from touching.
Acts as a barrier.

I feel like a ghost prostitute.

You know, like that
Jennifer Love Hewitt show.

You seen that?

You know, where she's,
like, a call girl for ghosts

or some shit.

No, that--
it's two different shows.

- All right, you two ready?
- Yeah.

No! Let me get
the hell out of here first.

I can't watch this part.

You-- you okay out there?

- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
- You need any help?

No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

Ooh. Why she didn't
cut me a mouth hole?

How am I supposed to--
whoa! Hello! Ooh!

Looks like I got
a visitor down there!

- Ooh!
- God damn it.

Whoops!
Ding dong ditch.

Somebody rang my bell
and ran away.

I feel like I'm fucking Casper.

Hey, you know,
it's getting seriously hard

to breathe under here.

- Can I take this off my face?
- No! No!

Birds chirping

Can you dump Frank at DFS?

I gotta drop some stuff off
for Carl.

Yeah, not a problem.

Let's go, Frank!
Showtime.

Been a while
since I've been in.

Maybe I need a new picture.

We had a bad meth run last year

and you know what
that stuff can do to you.

They've got a website
and everything.

Well, now that you've
filed your petition

to reinstate custody,
we'll need you to sign up

for parenting classes.

- Parenting classes?
- Good.

Also there may be
some random drug tests

and we'll need to set up
a home visit prior

to the possible
release of the children.

So I will get
the class registration.

I'll be right back.

Fucking big brother.

I don't want any goddamn
parenting classes.

What are they?

You sit in a room
and they lecture you

how to be Ozzie and Harriet.

I was thinking
maybe I could figure out

where I went wrong with Karen.

Kids come pre-wired,

it has nothing to do
with your parenting.

I pretty much like
being a blonde.

I feel like cotton candy.

Hi.

Uh, my name's Fiona Gallagher.
I'm here to visit Debbie.

Is she here?

- Are you her mother?
- Sister.

I just want to say hi.
May I see her?

I just want to talk to her!

Hey.

Do all your talking out here.

I'm gonna need her back
in 15 for chores.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Are there a million kids
in there?

Just a few,
but they're really nice.

And Kamala's not so bad.

Bed's pretty comfortable
and there's hot water.

Sighs

I brought you some books
and clothes.

- Do you need any money?
- Nope. I'm good.

Zipper

When do you think
we can go back home?

Soon.
Real soon.

I brought you some
Hershey's Kisses too.

These were like gold when
I was in my first foster home.

Thanks.

Breezy pop music



Hey, I got your brother's
working papers for today.

Oh, great.
I'll give them to him. Thanks.

- Where is he?
- Uh, latrine.

He's been there
most of the night.

Turns out eating diarrhea can
actually give you diarrhea, so...

Signed.
In and out.

And I better
see him at lights out.

That's it, Liam.
Big circles.

Urine tinkling

Doorbell rings

Please, come in.

Carl! Liam!
You have a visitor!

- Hi there, I'm Lanier.
- Hey, Fiona Gallagher.

Baby babbling Fiona!

Hey!
Look at you two!

Hey!

Wow, you look so clean.

Yeah, they make us
take baths every night.

And they have this weird toilet
that cleans your bits.

A "bidet."

Laughs
Sometimes in the summer

we use a whacky lawn
sprinkler for that, but...

Laughs we gotta watch
the spinning arms, right?

We gotta watch
those spinning arms.

Please, come.
Have a seat.

It's nice to see that the boys
have someone who loves them.

We're glad you came.

But just to make it clear,
we have filed the paperwork

to adopt Liam.

And we're seriously
considering adopting Carl too.

But please know that we'd
love for you to stay in contact

and visit as often
as you'd like.

We think it's important
for the boys to know

where they come from.

Why is my seat wet?

Oh, no, Liam. Did you
pee on the couch again?

Was that you?
And the wall too?

Liam, that is a matte finish!

How the hell are we
gonna get that out?

It's just paint, honey.
I can touch it up.

Now which color is that now?
Summer shadow?

He's just a baby.
He didn't mean it.

Babies are just so messy.

Baby babbling
Did you do that?

- Did you do that?
- A boat.

All right, I gotta get to work.

All right, just--
in a minute, okay?

Wanna do the honors?

- Is that a rosary for giants?
- No.

- Huh?
- No.

No, man, they're Ben Wa beads.

You shove them in my ass
and you pull them out real slow.

- How is that fun for me?
- Come on.

All right, okay.
Just easy on the injured cheek.

I'll just go on the other one,
all right?

- Yeah.
- Relax.

Grunts

Both grunting

- Fuck.
- Shit.

What the fuck?

Electronic music

Dad! Dad!
Hold on! Hold on!

- Mandy wasn't enough for you?
- Dad, hold on!

Fucking piece of shit!
Piece of shit!

Huh? Huh?

Get the fuck off him!

Both grunting

No son of mine is gonna
be a goddamn AIDS monkey!

Sit your ass down,
you fucking ass-digger!

Groans

Grunts

Groaning

It's Terry.
Send over the Russian.

Okay, role play.

All right, Monica, Frank.

Okay, Monica, you play
the teenage daughter.

And, Frank, you be the father
disciplining her

for staying out after curfew.

Um, where the hell
were you so late?

I was fucking mom's boyfriend.
What do you care?

You're nothing but
a little tramp, you know that?

Just like your mother.

You know what, if you
weren't stealing from her,

maybe she wouldn't have to screw
every Tom, Dick and Harry--

That bitch gave me herpes!

As far as I'm concerned,
I deserve every single dime.

- She did not have herpes.
- She fucking well did too.

How was that?

That one.

She's gonna fuck the faggot
out of you, kid.

Ride him till
he likes it, Suka.

And you're goddamn gonna watch.

Grunts

Rock music



Grunts



Grunting



How many more times
are we gonna have to do this?

Until we complete the mission.
Now, come on, baby.

You're Luke Skywalker
and it's up to you

to shoot one in
and destroy the Death Star!

Okay. Where's the sheet?

No. No, I couldn't
breathe last time.

Well, we gotta put
a Guantanamo hood on her

or something.

I don't know why I can't drink.

Okay, shut up!
It's hard for all of us.

So both of you, shut up!

Now everyone
get in your positions.

Snapping fingers

All right.

Sighs

Oh, come on, man!

Don't do this,
you piece of shit!

You get hard when
you smell pork chops.

Yelling at it
is not gonna help.

Come here.

Oh, there we go.

- Ow!
- Come on, you piece of shit!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
God, baby! You can't do that.

You're gonna build up calluses

and I won't be able
to feel dick.

Well, right now,
no one's feeling dick!

- You think this is easy?
- It's all my fault!

You can't make
the little soldier salute

if he doesn't see an officer
in the room.

Cries
I've lost all my stripes.

Mama, this is not
about you losing anything.

Cries

It's really me.
I'm under a lot of pressure.

- No.
- It's all me, mama.

I haven't had a date in months!

I'm old and fat
and unattractive

and I'm gonna die alone.

No, mama.
Cries

Well, this is not
helping me get hard.

Cries

Sighs It's like
when a plane goes down.

- What do they call that?
- Shitty?

No, it's never just
one thing that causes it.

It's a chain reaction.

Cascading failures.
That's what this feels like.

Losing my job, losing the kids,

dealing with Frank.

Sighs

Someone recently told me
to stop whining

and feeling sorry for myself.

Chuckles
She sounds like a bitch.

Well, she has her moments.

Legally and morally there are
acceptable methods of punishment

for children,
versus unacceptable methods.

Uh, I'm sorry.

Just hypothetically, if one's
teenage daughter gave birth

to a baby with Downs Syndrome
and then took off,

relieving her
of all responsibility,

if and when
she should come back,

would you recommend grounding?

Or in that instance would
a firm spanking be more...

You know, before
we take any more questions,

let's just go over some
of the basic...

- Would you give me a Valium?
- No, I only have one.

And it's my safety net in case
my hypnotherapy doesn't work.

Hypnotherapy is just paying
to nap in someone's office.

Give me a pill.

It's gonna show up
in your urine test.

- Give me the goddamn pill.
- What's the matter with you?

What this does is it
puts the responsibility

- right on the child.
- Okay. Come on.

Your job as parents
is to define the rules...

- Here. Christ.
- And then lay out

the consequences
that will follow

when those rules are broken.

Now the child breaking the rules
is then responsible

for his or her
own consequences.

And this method actually
leads to empowerment

and helps him or her feel more
in control of their own lives.

How is she still ovulating?
What is she, part bovine?

- Shh. Focus on me.
- Mm.

Yeah, now you're gonna pretend
like you're in high school

and you're gonna come quickly
like a rabbit, okay?

- Ooh, yeah.
- No, not that quick.

Mama, get in here!

Mm.

Grunts

- No. Not there, honey, no.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

You gotta shoehorn
or something?

Can you not talk, please?
Just don't say a word.

Cries

Are you crying?
Oh, God, she's crying.

Please don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry, mama.
Hey, hey, hey.

Okay! That's it!

We're gonna do this shit
and we're gonna be done with it.

Kev, get that dick hard.

Mama, wipe your
tears and focus!

We need to give those little
spermies someplace happy

to swim to.

Lay down!

Groans

Mm.

- Mama, get on it.
- Mm.

Mm. Mm!

Muffled groaning

- Aah!
- Mm.

Uh-huh.

Ooh!

Mm! Mm! Mm!

All passionately moaning

Hi.

I'm Monica.
What's your name?

Frank, wasn't the last time
I had to pee in a cup

when I was pregnant with Liam?

Remember that?
It was just like yesterday, huh?

Oh.

Uh, sorry, the shower
ran out of hot water.

Mama, you want Kevin
to take you home?

Well, he can't drive
with that leg.

No, but he can get
you home in a taxi.

It's the least we can do.

Well, let me get my bag.

Knock at door

- Hey, Carol.
- Hey, Fiona.

- Any work at the salon?
- Uh, not right now, baby.

- But I'll keep you in mind.
- Thanks.

Door closes

What was she doing here
so early?

She slept over
after she and Kevin had sex.

What?

Mama's the best surrogate
we got.

Turkey baster didn't work

so we had to do it
the old-fashioned way.

Jesus, V, I'm so wrapped up
in my own pity party,

I had no idea what kind
of biblical shit

you had going on here.

You okay?

If it works, I'll be fine.

How's Frank doing in rehab?

So far he seems
to be holding it together.

Heading over to DFS now
to make sure

he got all the paperwork in.

What's with all the asparagus?

You know how popeye
gets all big and strong

when he eats his spinach?

Mm-hm.

That's what asparagus
does for sperm.

Hm.

- You again.
- Me again.

Just wanted to make sure
Frank showed up

and all our paperwork
was good to go.

He did. He passed his
urine test with flying colors.

And yes, your paperwork
is all set.

So now we just wait
for a hearing?

Yeah.

You've done good, Fiona.
You are a great sister.

And those kids
are lucky to have you.

How did we show up
on DFS radar?

It was an anonymous
phone call, actually.

Chuckles
I bet it was that bitch

we turned away from daycare
'cause her kid stunk.

Um, no.

- It was a man, actually.
- A man?

It's never a man.
Men don't give a shit.

How is it fair that someone
can make one call

and completely ruin our lives,
and they get to be anonymous?

I have to go to the restroom.

I'd appreciate it
if you didn't click on this file

while I'm gone.

Frank: Yes, hello,
I would like to report

a negligent situation.

2119 North Wallace.

Gallagher.

Female:
And what's the situation?

Frank: Six kids living
in squalor.

No parental supervision.

When the father is there,
he's drunk.

He hits them.
Not that they don't deserve it.

They're all criminals,
delinquents, vile--

Female: - Excuse me, sir.
Frank: - What?

Female: Could you give me
your name, please?

Frank: No.
If it's all right,

I would like
to remain anonymous.

Female: Thank you for bringing
this to our attention.

Frank: No. Thank you.
And God bless you.

Hannah Cartwright & Ross Tones




 Don't believe the lies

 your echoing heartbeat,
echoing heartbeat

 keeps our time


I'm raising five kids,
and I didn't miss last week.

What's your excuse?

Shut the fuck up!

I need you
to get a will notarized.

- Will?
- Aunt Ginger's.

A will's no good
without a death certificate.

Yeah, we're gonna need
a body too.

- A real live body?
- Not live.

I'm here to file a will,
please.

Ginger Gallagher.
Second one today.

Supersedes yours.

Who the hell filed it?
Cousin Patrick.

Both: Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Kev is just gonna lie down
with you for procreation.

Okay, let's get this going.

- Laughs
- Shh, knock it off, mama.

How many more times
are we gonna have to do this?

Until we complete
the mission.

You guys look like
you could use some help.

You can go home.

You know what?
Have her stick around.

I got to hit the Alibi
in ten minutes anyway.

- I'm good to stay.
- Please just go home

to your own
fucking house for once.

You mind if I make
one of these out to cash?

Nothing big,
just some walking around money.

Joint bank account
is for Immigration only.

Have a heart.
I'm tapped.

- Mom.
- Oh!

Where is he, my baby?

He's where
he belongs for now,

and you're back
where you belong.

Now, if I allow you
to retain your parental rights,

would you consent to
your daughter becoming guardian?

Works for me.

Would you agree to be
the guardian of these children?

Yes, I do.




High Strung's
The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Thank you all for coming out
in honor of Aunt Ginger.

"GG" as I called her.

You now, when the guy
at the funeral place

handed me her ashes,
I thought,

what the hell
do I do with these?

Put 'em in a vase
on my mantle?

Or scatter them
at the park or the lake?

Then I thought, no,

I know where
she was happiest.

On this corner,
her corner,

where she turned tricks
in her 20s and 30s.

And 60s!

- She did magic tricks?
- No, no, no, son.

"Turning tricks" is
a euphemism for prostitution.

In her day, your great aunt was
a legendary pole smoker.

Could unlock her jaw
like a Burmese python.

We are at her funeral.

You know,
some think Gallaghers

don't have a work ethic,

but Ginger worked this corner
rain, sleet, snow,

her old knees hitting
that hard pavement

again and again.

Bertie Giddelman is the only one
that's outlasted her.

Look, you all knew Ginger,
so I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

She was a mean old bitch.

But even a mean old bitch
deserves a send off.

Here, here.

So this is us, Ginger,

sending you off,
right where you belong.

It's touching.

I'm tearing up.

Okay, kids, let's go.

Patrick.

So Ginger had a will
that we didn't know about,

and you just had it sitting
in a drawer?

Yep.

And even though
she hated your guts,

she left our house to you?

It was never your house.

It's weird, you know,

how she signed the will
only a year ago,

you know, her being
an invalid and all.

Signed and notarized.

I don't remember you
coming by with a lawyer.

I gotta get back
to my family.

Six kids
with nowhere else to go.

Why don't
we talk about this

when the sting of losing Ginger
has worn off, hmm?

Tomorrow, maybe?

You want to tell them
or should I?

V, your mom's here.

Ooh.
You look really nice, Carol.

- Thank you, honey.
- You do look nice.

- Where'd you get that dress?
- Madison's.

And those shoes.

You doing something
at church later?

I'm ovulating again.

Ovulating?

No, it's not until next week.
I got the calendar.

High body temperature,
sore breasts,

increased cervical mucus.

We believe you, mama.

Well, if you all want
to try again,

we have a four-day window.

Guess no need to waste
an opportunity, right, baby?

What, you wanna do this
right now?

Like, right now?

Well, I can come back.

No, no need.

I'm like a stud bull.

You open the barn door,
slap me on the ass.

You know, I mean, when I say,
"open the barn door,"

I don't mean your, um--

uh, do you guys
want a drink?

I'll get three glasses.

Are you sure you just want
to jump into this?

You don't want a minute
to think?

Waiting isn't gonna
make it easier.

All right, I'm gonna
block everything out,

and I'm just gonna picture
your beautiful face.

- I picture Denzel Washington.
- Oh, for real?

When I open my eyes a little
and I see it's a white guy,

eh, then I go
with Johnny Depp.

Oh?

You appreciate the irony,
right?

Senseless arguments about
who gets what bedroom,

refusing to allow me to stay.

- Now, nobody gets to stay.
- Why is Frank here again?

There's a small chance
he'll be able to help

since he's known Patrick
longer than any of us.

Patrick wants
to steal our house?

He's a contractor.
He's gonna flip it.

Slap a coat of paint on it,

call it
"a cozy, authentic pre-war,"

and offload it to yuppies.

Not gonna happen.

- So let's go over our options.
- I'll write them down.

All right, look, we know
the will is bullshit.

It was signed a year ago,

and Ginger's
been dead for what, 10?

More like 15.

Option one.
Prove will is a forgery.

We can't call the cops
because we faked Ginger's death

and forged a will of our own.

Plus Frank's been cashing
Ginger's social security checks.

Oh, like you didn't share
in that bounty?

What we could do,
we could argue

that Ginger wasn't of
sound mind when she signed it.

I mean, she was
never of sound mind anyway.

Option two.
Say Ginger was crazy.

Or convince Patrick
to back off somehow.

Yeah, that's three.

Good luck with that!

His nickname
used to be Pit Bull.

It was partly an odor thing,

but also because once he gets
ahold of you, he doesn't let go.

You gotta kill him first.

Option four. Kill Patrick.

It's time to face reality.

Patrick out-Gallaghered us,

and there's no point
in fighting it.

Easy for you to say,
you're at Sheila's.

So before you're out
on the streets

like so many Somalian refugees,
ask yourselves,

"if Patrick
is taking the house,

what are we taking?"

Copper pipes.

You're not taking the pipes,
Frank.

You really think there's
a way to challenge the will?

Why not? You know,
if I can bone up on probate law.

All in favor.

Unanimous.

Well, like hell it is.

Lip will handle the will.

The rest of you,

get ready for the first day
of school tomorrow.

Debbie and Carl,
pick out something to wear

that doesn't have holes.

Wouldn't it just be easier
to kill him?

Clothes, now.

We better work fast.

Winter's coming, and it'll
be cold sleeping in the park.

This is why democracy
does not work.

Time to get out
the "help wanted" ads.

- How you holding up?
- You know what I want?

Not to win the lottery or
go on vacation to the Caribbean.

I want normal people problems.

Like,
am I getting enough fiber?

Why did my friend
say that insensitive thing

about my weight?

Well, it'll work out,
it always does.

You realize only rich people
say shit like that.

What's that
supposed to mean?

That we have no backup plan.

There's no running
to mom and dad.

And that's what I do?

I'm saying neither one of us
has a job.

One week with me
as their guardian, one,

they're about to be homeless.

Then we'll get jobs.

I mean, the Gallaghers
are survivors, right?

We can do this.

We?

You, me, we.

Since when
are you a lawyer?

Since never,

which is why I have to read up
on this shit.

How 'bout
I give you a hummer,

help you relax?

I don't think that's
gonna help my productivity.

You can multitask.

 Said I find it hard



Would you, uh...

would you be offended
if I kept working?

Knock at door

Lip, can we talk?

Yeah, if you can talk
from out there.

It's private.

This better be good.



 sometimes we know

 but sometimes

 oh baby sometimes

 you gotta get
what you need



I rang the doorbell,

but Ian had me wait out here.

I don't think
he likes me anymore.

I don't think
he ever liked you.

I got your message.

Right, the one where I told
you to go fuck yourself?

It was nice
to hear your voice.

Eiffel Tower?

Yeah, this guy said
he'd take me to Paris,

so I had this done.

But he took all my money

and tried to sell me
to a sheikh from Yemen.

So, yeah, things got bad
for a little while.

But anyways,

I'm-- I'm home now.

That sounds shitty.

Is Mandy inside?

Yeah.

So that's why Ian
had me wait out here?

That'd be my guess.

Are you happy?

Sure.

Well, good, because
I want you to be happy.

You deserve it.

Well, I--

I better get back.

You look good.

Welcome back.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- You have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.

Well, here's a good one.

Barista at the coffee beanery.

Shelly Espinosa works there,
makes like 20 grand.

A month?
A year?

Shit.
How do people live on that?

So the cleaning posse guys
called back.

An effluent tank overflowed
at the slaughterhouse.

They can use us both.
$14.50 an hour.

- A what tank?
- Effluent.

See, I told you
it would work out.

It's so exciting having you
back in your old room.

I just wish I had seen
Hymie in his crib.

Well, Mrs. Wong
can bring Hymie by anytime.

How is he?

He's wonderful.

Oh my gosh,
he is such a sweet boy.

And now that you're home,
I'm sure the Wongs

will let us spend more time
with him.

I'm not sure I'm ready
for that yet.

I know you want to be
involved in Hymie's life.

In fact, I found a flyer
for a support group.

Support for what?

For families affected
with Down's Syndrome.

I thought it might be a way
for us to educate ourselves

about Hymie's needs.

Be grateful
the kid's not here.

Butt out, Frank!

Children in the Cambodian
killing fields

turned their parents
over for execution.

A lifetime of devotion,
that's the loyalty it buys you.

Who wants lasagna?

Oh, Karen,
please put your pants on.

What?
It's not like I'm naked.

I'm in recovery.
I'm hypersensitive.

That's a good idea.

Jody, there's only three
plates here.

You might want to get one
for Karen.

Mouthing silently

I'm gonna go make a salad.

Oh, great.

Um...

Frank.

Uh-huh?

Honey, we've been through
a lot together.

That we have, Sheils,
that we have.

Um, but Hymie's gone,

and with Karen and Jody here,
it's kind of a full house.

What?

No.
No, no, no, don't say that.

Frank, I'm just asking you
to go home to your family.

My family threw me out with
no regard for my well-being.

Do you want me homeless?

Do you want me
wandering the streets

just as old man winter
winds his way down

from the frozen north?

Don't you have someone you can
stay with, like a friend?

Just as I'm getting
my life together.

I'm going to AA.

You go because
a judge ordered you to go.

Sheila.

Frank, you're a good man,

but you've got to find
another place to stay.

Jesus, Carl,
there's enough to go around.

Would you grab the paper bags?

If we have to move,
where do we go?

We're not moving.

How's it going
with Ginger's will?

Working on it.

V, thanks for
taking Liam today.

I pretend he's
my little black baby,

and when he's cranky and smelly,
I get to bring him back.

Where is Liam?

Trying out
the big boy toilet.

And you left him there?

Debbie, that is not
the outfit that we picked out

for your first day, and you are
so not leaving here in that.

- I borrowed it from Mandy.
- Clearly.

You do realize that
I'm in middle school now, right?

Yeah, not stripper school.
Go change.

Knocking at door
Somebody get that.

Mandy, she's 13.

She's not working the bedroom
at the Mustang Ranch.

Yeah, like you never wore
a short skirt

when you were her age.

Jeez, Fi,
she's just trying to help.

Knocking at door
I'll get it.

Can you take
Liam tomorrow too?

Not sure yet.

Those fruits of Islam people
on 4th have a free daycare.

If I say I hate whitey,

I bet they'll watch him
for a few hours.

So is Lip getting serious
about Mandy "Skankovich"?

Nice.

Oh, shit, Mandy, I'm sorry.

You know I would have never
said that to your face.

Should I apologize or leave?

I'm gonna leave.

You and I both know you're not
legally entitled to shit.

Patrick?

You remember my sons,
Desmond and Warren.

What are you doing here?

Oh, just a quick walkthrough
to assess repairs,

shouldn't take too long.

It'd be quicker
if you just left.

You're the ones
that are gonna be leaving.

Assuming your bullshit will
stands up in court.

Probate hearing
is on Thursday.

This Thursday?

Uh-huh.
Why prolong the inevitable?

I'm gonna need you
out on Saturday

so I can spray the place
with insecticide,

rip up this piss carpet,

and, you know,
make it livable.

Boys, start upstairs.

We've got kids
living here,

and you're just gonna
throw us out?

How do you sleep at night?

Don't blame your miserable
goddamn lives on me.

Indistinct chatter

Okay, listen up.

Some of you have inquired
about our petition.

We have demanded that
Lincoln Grove high school

offer programs
for special students

to help them fit in
with their classmates.

Applause

- Aren't you glad we came?
- Yeah.

Great, also concerning
the "R" word,

we have demanded
a school policy

forbidding students and faculty
from using that word.

- Retard.
- Excuse me.

Retard.
You can't even say it.

So how do we talk about it?

We all know your opinion
on this, Jeremy.

But right now
I'm the one speaking.

Brothers and sisters,

words only have power
if we give them power.

We must take back
the word "retard."

Make it ours.

Sweetheart, the rest of us
find the word offensive.

I'm not your sweetheart,
bitch.

All gasp

Mrs. Kandage,
I know you mean well,

but many of us here
think it's time

that we reclaim
and redefine the word.

And since normies
don't get called "retard,"

they don't have
a say in this.

Normies do not get a say.

What's a "normie?"

I think it's slang
for non-retards.

- Hey, Fabio, do you mind?
- Sorry.

I don't care how it's used.

I don't want anybody calling
my son that word ever.

It's incredibly hurtful.

Even if we did get rid of it,

someone will just think up
another way of saying it.

That's right.
The queers took back their word.

- It's different.
- How is it different?

It's not like
race issues disappear

if people stop saying nigger.

Shut the fuck up!

I can say it, you can't.

Retards,
we must ban together.

The way to get respect
is to take respect,

and normies can help us
get that message out.

Raise your hand
if you're with us!

Yeah.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation.

All: Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,

retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation!

You digging that smell?

Did something die in here?

A couple thousand somethings.

- It gets better after awhile.
- How?

Your brain
sort of short-circuits,

shuts off your sense of smell.

Tape everything up,
gloves and boots.

We got solids in there today.

Solids?

Maggots, roaches,
rats, flies.

You got roaches
inside your suit

going crazy, running all over
your short hairs,

hard to focus on work.

Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God.

Keep your mouth shut,
and I don't mean shut up.

I mean, don't let anything
splash in your mouth.

Your girlfriend
gonna be okay?

Thank you, everyone,
for sharing.

Have a good day.

Groans

Great meeting.

I just need to get
my slip signed for the court.

Okay.

Let's see.

I guess we'll see you twice
a week for at least six months.

Keep coming back, Frank.

As if I had a fucking choice.

- Congratulations.
- What?

I said congratulations.

During group share you said
you're two years sober,

unless I misunderstood.

No, that's right.
Two years today.

Oh, only six weeks for me.

It hasn't been easy.

I was downing
cleaning products, mouthwash.

- You ever try Sterno?
- Love Sterno.

It's ridiculous
what passes for alcoholism

with this group.

Her two-hour blackout?

I mean, come on.

I blacked out a year.

Am I whining about it?

Or the guy that lost his job
and banged his sister-in-law?

Where I come from,
that's Friday night.

Both chuckle

But you've been sober
two years.

That's amazing.

But it's because
you don't need booze

to fill the gaping hole
in your life.

It's about being
in the moment.

A meatball sub.

A Bears game
on the television.

Simple pleasures.

Simple pleasures, right.

Frank,
I'm Chris or Christopher.

I hope you don't mind
if I ask.

Would you be my sponsor?

- Would I--
- Sponsor me in the program.

My previous sponsor moved out
and went to Leesburg.

That's in Florida.

Right, right.
But here's the thing.

Much as I'd love to help,

and inspiring
as I would no doubt be,

your best sponsor
is yourself.

I understand.

Take care.

Wait.

You said your last sponsor
moved out.

What, he--
what, he lived with you?

- Yeah.
- In a house?

You live in a house,
an apartment, what?

A house.

I'm sorry, let me
introduce myself properly.

I'm Frank Gallagher.

Tell me your name again.

It's Chris or Christopher.

Christopher, right.

Gags

I'm getting out.

I'm getting out.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry, but no one speaking
English as a first language

should be doing this job.

The money's good.

Not that good.

So much for
"you, me, we."

I can feel cockroaches
under my suit.

On my back!
Hit me on my back!

Hit me on my-- fuck.

Oh.

Oh, hey, these candles
are a nice idea.

- Mom brought 'em.
- Oh, she did?

Just look at me.

That's it.

Oh, shit.

You're a stud bull,
aren't you, baby?

Oh, yeah.

Hold that thought.
Mom!

Jump in between us.
Hurry up.

Wasn't sure
when to bring this up,

but maybe I could use
a little warm-up this time.

Warming up,
like a jog around the block?

'Cause if you're asking Kev
to go down on you,

I can tell you right now
that is not happening.

Women are more likely to
conceive if they have an orgasm.

I read it in Cosmo.

It pulls the sperm up into--

The conversation is
not happening on this end,

just saying.

- Hey, sorry I bailed.
- Don't be sorry.

I'm sure tons of guys would
leave their girlfriends alone

to shovel blood and shit.

I went down to the coffee
beanery and got a job.

How much per hour?

I mean, you know, not
as much as the cleaning posse,

but all the coffee
you can drink.

- Full-time?
- Close.

- How close?
- Part-time.

There are opportunities
for advancement.

The manager was saying--

We've reconvened
the Cousin Patrick war council.

No luck on the legal front?

No, it turns out
it's pretty hard to prove

that someone had dementia
when they signed a will.

In our case,
very fucking hard.

Because she was already dead.

- What was option two again?
- We're on three now.

Convince Patrick to back off.

Or option four,
kill Patrick.

Back to three.
Convince him how?

We get my brothers to go
around and scare him a little.

No way.

Enough with
the brothers Milkovich.

Nothing fatal.

Hit him with a bat
a couple of times,

a little pistol whipping.

They'll want $500 for it,

but if I help Mickey
move some meth next week,

they'll settle for $200.

That's a discount beating.

What do you say?

Guys, we can't--

We need a house.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll be scraping blood and shit

from under my fingernails,

and then I'll be at V's
getting drunk,

pretending I didn't just
order a hit on a relative.

All right.

Frank, what are you doing?

Sheila, this is Christopher.

As his AA sponsor,

I'm helping him to walk
the straight and narrow.

Well, that's nice, but how can
you be his sponsor when you--

- I said to him, "if you're
serious about recovery,

you're gonna need
24-hour-a-day oversight.

I'm just gonna have
to move in with you."

Really?

That Frank would do this,
disrupt his own life...

All I ask in return
is your sobriety.

Here, take this down
to your van.

Oh!

Nice meeting you.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Thank you, Frank.
Great job.

Never let it be said
that Frank Gallagher

outstays his welcome.

Karen, look what they gave me
when I offered to volunteer.

Pamphlets and buttons
and a banner and t-shirts.

Why don't you
come with me tomorrow?

I'm gonna have a table
outside the market.

- No thanks, mom.
- Can I ask why not?

Because they call themselves
retard nation.

It's offensive.

No, we're-- we're--

we're challenging society's
preconceptions.

This is genius.
"I am a retard."

Yeah, but read the back.

"And proud."
I'm gonna need five of these.

A lot of retards
at the Alibi.

Frank, I'm not comfortable
with how you're using that word.

Retard?
You're saying it.

Yeah, but you don't
have Down's Syndrome.

Neither do you.

I know, but my intent
is to defend free speech

and to further public
awareness and end hate.

And your intent
is simply to be rude.

Hello?

V?

Oh!

Uh, oh, sorry.

Oh.

Ahh.

Ugh, ah.

That threw me off.
Periscope down.

Hey.

Look, you need to back off
the Gallagher house.

If you don't,
you'll be sorry.

Groans

Fuck sake.

A .22?

You sure it'll stop me?

You want to find out?

What the fuck are you doing?

Get up and
knock him on his ass.

I got him covered.

I'd like you to meet the wife,
Ellen.

They're removing
the toilets.

I'll get some buckets.

I guess it didn't work out
with your brother.

Mandy, are we getting
our money back?

Minus $100.
He took a chain off Mickey.

Over there.
By the couch.

Yeah, just leave it.

Bye, honey, off to work.

Why is he leaving
a toilet in our living room?

Bye, honey!
I'm off to work!

We are so losing the house.

- I told you we are going--
- To be fine, I know.

But will we be fine here
or somewhere else?

The probate hearing
is tomorrow.

Maybe we'll get lucky.

If not, I will find us
a place to live, okay?

Please drop Liam at V's
on your way to school.

Everyone else,
grab a lunch and head out.

No truant Gallaghers today.

Hammers banging

You know, being guardian
doesn't make you super-mom.

You noticed.

I'm just saying,
it's not all on you.

Thanks.

Drill whirring

How are you this morning?

Never better.

Replacing the toilet
with a low-flow model,

much more efficient.

I bet it lowers
the water bill.

Oh, without question.

Patrick, we got off
on the wrong foot.

Sending Mickey Milkovich over
with a baseball bat, hmm?

Is that the foot you mean?

If we let you take the house,
will you rent it to us?

Sure.

Call it $1,800 a month,

first, last, and deposit.

You know we don't have
that kind of--

No?

I thought living in squalor
was a lifestyle choice.

It's just that when we first
started this with mom,

we approached it
like a medical procedure,

but these last few times,
is it me

or was she acting
like she was on a date?

She always dresses nice.

Musk perfume,
gold tips.

When has she ever worn gold tips
to our house, Kev?

Like I'd notice.

So you have no idea
what I'm talking about?

Baby, maybe she made
an extra effort.

Aha!

What's wrong with that?

Low-cut dress,
"fuck-me" pumps.

Maybe she's excited
to have a grandchild,

wants me to be
properly motivated.

And that doesn't
freak you out?

This whole thing
freaks me out,

and I'm trying
not to think about it.

I'm like
a professional athlete.

If I think, it affects
my performance.

My job is to not think.

Fuck! Fuck!

If you're gonna
follow me to work,

how about giving me a ride?

Not your chauffeur, bro.

Don't burn the milk.

It's not good
when you burn it.

Jim!

Andy from med school.

I'm at County General
down the street.

No kidding.

Good to see you.

I love this place.
Great coffee.

You're a working man now, huh?

Oh, management trainee.

You know, they won't let you
buy a franchise

till you run
one of their stores.

Nice.

I hear these places
are a gold mine.

What can I get you, man?

Hey, you know Adam britt,
Nick Stathis, Mark?

They're all doing
residencies in Chicago.

Nick's ortho,
Mark's a surgeon.

We're grabbing dinner
tomorrow night.

You should join us.

Yeah, sounds fun.

But I'm not sure if I can.

They would love to see you.
You gotta come.

Um, double cappuccino
with non-fat.

I was gonna wait
for the landlord,

but somebody already
kicked the door in for us.

That's considerate.

At least
it's in our price range.

Barely.

Well, it's not like we live
in the Gold Coast now.

Place just needs some paint,
a case of roach motels.

Down the road,
maybe we save some money

and find a house
back in our old hood.

Need a crack pipe?

Better not touch that.

Touch it?
I'm ready to smoke out of it.

I guess I'll call the landlord
and tell him we'll take it.

Retches

I need you to watch
your baby brother.

And who's that puking
on his Timberlands?

Cousin Patrick.

He's got nausea,
shortness of breath,

blood in urine,
severe illness, and death.

What the hell
are you reading?

Rat poison.

Hi! Hi!

We are Retard Nation.

Yeah, we're
a local organization,

but as the name suggests,
we are going national.

We're promoting the idea
that people with Down's Syndrome

need to reclaim
their own identities

in order to define themselves.

So if you'd like to,
you can make a donation

or if you'd like to buy
a t-shirt or just get signed--

What the hell is this?

Well, we're a local
organization, Retard Nation--

Take it down now.

Sir, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

Lady, you're not gonna stand
in front of my market

with this goddamn sign.

Pack it up now or I'll do it,
all right?

Sir, we will not
be intimidated by normies.

- By what?
- By normies.

Goddamn it,
get this crap out of here.

- Don't!
- All of it.

- Ma'am, I'm very sorry--
- Don't!

Do not touch me
in front of my market.

This is hate speech.
Get your hands off of me.

Me-tard, you-tard,
retard nation.

So this is it.

It's only a one-bedroom,
but I'm at work a lot.

- Christopher.
- Yeah, Frank?

In order
for the healing to begin,

it's important
that you be honest

and tell me
where you hide your booze.

Under the cushions?
Back of the closet?

I know all the tricks.

I threw it out.

Do you mind if I look around
in case you missed a bottle?

Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

Where do you work?

I'm a vet tech for the city.

I deal with
stray cats and dogs.

Meaning you kill them?

In veterinary parlance,
it's called "control."

Sometimes I rescue
a beauty like Bessie there.

It makes me feel better
about it all.

Hey, I've got
a surprise for you.

Why don't I grab it?

- What sort of surprise?
- You'll see!

Hey.

You know your dog is dead,
right?

Taxidermy
is a hobby of mine.

Sighs

So when you say rescue,

you mean bring them home
and stuff them,

because most people
when they used that word--

Meatball subs!

Like you said, remember?

Simple pleasures.

Living in the moment.

Sounds like something
I would say.

You mentioned
you're a Bears fan.

There's no game on, but I've got
last season's highlights.

You eat, I'll cue it up.

You want a blanket?

It's kind of chilly.

I have a new respect
for baristas.

It turns out it's
a highly demanding craft.

Who knew?

You keep burning the shit
out of your--

what's up?

Tell him.

I killed Patrick.

What?

Option four. Kill Patrick.

Why skip an option?

The whole life in prison
thing, sweetheart.

I realize you've had sketchy
parental role models, okay?

But as your
newly appointed guardian,

can we agree that
offing people is not cool?

Can we get on
the same page with that?

Yeah.

If this comes back to us,

if we get charged
with homicide,

do you realize
how serious that is?

What?

Liam.

Oh, Liam.

Oh, got him in time.

We need to come up
with an explanation

in case the cops
tie this to us.

Like we have rats and
Carl threw poison everywhere.

- That works.
- It does?

Anyone who knows you
will know it's not far-fetched.

Debbie, go get everyone so
we can get our story straight.

Okay.

I'm raising a sociopath.

I'm sure that your cousin
went to the hospital,

so he'll probably live.
Hopefully.

Mandy,
I thought that was you.

What the fuck you doing here?

Re-enrolling.

So I know you're seeing Lip,

but like I told him,
I think it's great.

You talked to Lip?

I came by last Tuesday
to say hi.

I didn't come inside.

Lip didn't want me inside,

because, you know,
he didn't want to upset you.

Why would I be upset?

Oh, you wouldn't.

Forget it.

I just meant
I'm happy for you guys.

Latte.

Wait till you try
these pancakes.

Organic blueberries.

You're adjusting very well
for an addict.

Thanks to you, sponsor.

If it weren't for you,

this place would be littered
with whiskey bottles.

What was
your drink of choice?

Terry's.

Never heard of that.

Terry's, uh,
malted whiskey.

You mean malt whiskey?
Like single malt?

Well, all kinds of malt.

Get up in the morning
and drink a full keg of beer.

Man, was that bad.

A keg is 15 gallons.

I didn't know better,

I would think
you're making stuff up.

Our relationship is based
on honesty, Christopher.

I tried to drink alcohol.

I just don't like the taste.

Jesus Christ!
You're not an alcoholic?

Forgive me.

Well, then why go to AA?
Why have me as your sponsor?

Please, Frank,
please, don't move out.

Everything is going
so good with us.

I won't lie to you again.

I promise.

I'll make us prime rib.

Groans

Last night of mom's
ovulation cycle, thank God.

She just needs to screw Kev
and not enjoy it.

That's not unreasonable.

That's what every daughter
wants from her mother.

What time is it?

3:15 and still no Patrick.

We don't want him to come,
do we?

It's kind of a toss-up.

If he does show,
the judge gives our house away.

If he doesn't,
he's probably dead,

so we get to keep the house
until we all go to prison.

The estate
of Ginger Gallagher.

Here we go.

Guys.

Cough

What now?
Start packing?

Fiona said that you guys
found a place to rent.

Did you take any photos?

You're kidding.

You're serious.

You knew Karen was in town,
didn't you?

I heard that, yeah.

You heard it.

I saw her.

Saw her or fucked her?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I don't want to be
somewhere that I'm not wanted,

so man up, tell me.

I have a problem
with you being here.

You act like
we had a conversation,

never happened.

That I said that it was okay
for you to leave your stuff here

and show up uninvited, do my
laundry, and act like my wife.

But we-- we never
had that conversation,

did we?

I never asked you to be here.

I don't fucking
deserve this.

You found
a new house for rent?

That's great.

Landlord says
it's ours if we want it.

New school?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I never should
have let this happen.

I'm so sorry.

I'm kind of sick
of this place anyway.

Nice to have a change.

Techno music

Speaking portuguese

Hey.

Going out tonight with
some medical school friends.

Totally upstanding citizens.
You wanna give me a ride?

- I'm not your chauffeur.
- "Not your chauffeur," right.

So you'd rather me
take the El train,

make you get out of your car
to follow me.



Chicago and La Salle.



Don't you look nice.

Yes, she does.

I brought some rose

and some more candles
and some CDs.

You like D'Angelo, Kevie?

You know, a little music
to set the mood.

It's great you want
to set the mood, mama.

It's just Kev and I want
to keep this straight forward,

more like a procedure.

As opposed to what?

- A date.
- Excuse me?

I'm not some whore who comes
over in a raggedy t-shirt,

has relations with
your boyfriend, and leaves.

If we gonna do this,

we might as well
get some ambiance up in here.

Otherwise,
get some trashy thing

won't mind if you bend her
over the kitchen table.

She didn't mean it
like that, mama.

Is this happening or not?

I want to hear my CD.

Knocking at door

Come in.

Oh.

Not who I was expecting.

That guy in New York, he, uh,
he really take your money?

Think I would lie
about that?

Well, why not?

It'll make everyone feel bad
for you, lower their guard.

Poor Karen, back home
with her tail between her legs.

That's right.

It's all an act.

You talk to Mandy?

Who?

Oh, Mandy, right.

Yeah, at school.

Kind of a skank,
don't you think?

So you dropped napalm
on my relationship

without even getting
your hands dirty.

Well, it's not like
you lost your touch.

What do you want?

Take your clothes off.

Horns honking

Hey!

Hey!

You think
that t-shirt's funny?

No.
No, it's-- it's political.

It's actually pro-tard.

Yeah?
Well, tell that to my sister.

Oh, shit.

Nice.

Ooh, that's it, baby,
that's it.

Ooh, ooh, yeah.

Ooh.

Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

Ooh, that's it.

Ooh, bring it home.

Bring it home, baby.

Ooh, yeah.

Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

Stop!

Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

You people want to have
a baby, beautiful.

Find another way to do it.

I can't be working
under these conditions.

All right,
we'll call you.

Moaning

Karen, honey,
can you come down?

- Don't stop.
- I wasn't planning on it.

Karen,
Mrs. Wong is here.

Oh, come on in.

Timmy saw you
at the supermarket.

Oh, oh, that's just my
volunteer work for Hymie's sake.

- You have to stop that shit.
- Gasps Excuse me?

Timmy saw you fight
with that man.

He's embarrassed for you.

Well, I don't know
if it's a cultural thing

and you're not aware,
but you're being rude right now.

Jody, can you help Mrs. Wong
with the crib?

You act crazy.

I can't leave
the baby with you.

What about you trying to cure
him with your Chinese herbs?

I mean, you need to accept him
for who he is.

No more baby.

Let me know which car's yours.
I'll load it up for you.

She's hoarding Hymie.

What?

Okay, I won't volunteer
anymore if that's what you want.

You promise?

I promise.

I bring the baby tomorrow,

but I stay to watch you.

Okay.

Blue Impala.

Okay.

Your Karen is right.

This is not a good place
for baby.

Karen? My--

when did you talk to Karen?

What kind of a creep
uses Alcoholics Anonymous

to cater
to his nefarious agenda?

It is a slap in the face

to everyone
who attends the program.

Nice shirt, Frank.

Not that we didn't know.

Laughter

So he doesn't need
a sponsor.

But he lets you live there
rent-free, and he's feeding you?

It doesn't add up,
does it?

Well, if I were you,
I'd make sure

that he's not a rapist
or a serial killer.

I mean,
you said he's a loner, right?

Super neat?
I bet he's got hardwood floors.

So?

Carpets get bloodstains.

What's he do for a living?

He kills animals,
occasionally stuffs them.

He what?

It's called "animal control"
in veterinary parlance.

It's called he's
Jeffrey fucking Dahmer, dude.

He finds a guy
no one will miss,

gets them to move in with him,
pumps them full of vet drugs.

He's gonna drill
a hole in your head

and turn you
into his zombie sex slave.

Before we get carried away,

Christopher
had a sponsor before me.

The guy moved to Florida.

Oh, he moved to Florida.

And who told you that,
Christopher?

Christopher.

Be careful, Frank.

You're gonna wake up

and find your dick
in a ziploc in his freezer.

 I wanna have
the world at my feet

 I need to know

 just how sweet
is sweet

 I'm gonna take my kicks
as they come

 yeah,
I'm gonna have some fun

 I want to be
high up on top

 I've got no choice

 I just can't stop

Fiona!

What's going on?

I've got Patrick Gallagher
outside with an eviction notice.

You're throwing us out?

This was supposed to take
a couple of weeks.

Normally.
The guy seems like an asshole.

I'm trying to chill him out,

but he's made
a couple accusations.

He said you tried to kill him.

That's ridiculous.

He has a toxicology report
from the hospital.

He says he won't press charges
if you move out tonight.

He can't be serious.

He seems to be serious.

But Patrick loves me.

Yeah, well,
is there a place you can go?

Tonight?
No.

Patrick gave me candy.

Debs, go get Lip and Ian,
please.

And then he got
in bed with me

and touched me
in my nice places.

What was that?

About candy
or Patrick touching me?

Patrick Gallagher?

Mm-hmm.

And when you say
"nice places"?

Uh, private places.

Frank?

Aw, fuck.

Frank?

Frank.
Frank.

Frank.

Frank.

Aghh!
Get away from me!

These people are witnesses.

Where have you been?

I've been looking
all over for you.

What do you want?

Are you all right?
Have you had a relapse?

Don't touch me.

I could be your sponsor.
I'm not a drinker,

but I've been to so many
meetings, I know the procedure.

No!
No, no, thank you.

I'm sorry
if I freaked you out.

I'm not real good with,
well, with people, really.

It was great
having someone to talk to.

Get a room, assholes.

I'm sorry, Frank.

See you around.

Wait, wait.

You're not gonna stuff me
or drill a hole in my head?

What?

Your interest in me is not
of a perverse or sexual nature?

No,
nothing like that.

I mean, if you're saying
you want to have sex with me,

I guess I'd do my best.

What happened
to your old sponsor?

Either he's in Florida,

or he's avoiding me,
thinks I'm creepy,

being clingy and all,
and lonely.

So basically
the problem is you're clingy.

What's for dinner
at your place?

Rib eyes.

But we stop at the liquor
store, and you're paying?

- Anything you want.
- Let's go.

Really?
You mean it?

Oh, clingy
is a walk in the park.

Here, have it.

- I really like her.
- Yeah?

She's a poet.

Karen.

Oh, mom,
you scared me.

You told me you
came home to be with Hymie,

but you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Why would you do that?

I missed you, mom.

So it's true.

Everything was better
before Hymie came along,

just you and me.

I wanted us back.

I love you.

You're shitting me.

Standard police procedure, sir.

We'll have to meet
the sex crimes detectives

- at the station, unless--
- Unless what?

- The charges are dropped.
- Charges are--?

400 a month rent,
no deposit.

Are you in on this?

I'm not in on anything, sir.

I am, however, gonna make
a radio call from the car.

You can take your 400
and shove it up your ass.

I remember your hands
touching me and--

- $1,200.

You said it was
our little secret.

I knew it was wrong.

Jesus, what--

900, final offer.

500, no deposit.

I need a 50-year lease,
and I want that in writing.

Groans

Hey, check it out.

Left a poison sandwich
in the crawl space.

- Don't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

Ugh, too late.

Why the outpouring
of affection?

We didn't lose the house.

I was molested.
It all worked out.

- What?
- We can stay.

I put your toothbrush
back in the cup.

Want an eye mask?

Curtains let
a lot of light in.

Thanks.

- Night, Frank.
- Good night, Christopher.

I'm going to bed, babe.

All right,
I'll be up in a second.

Text alert

Who's that?

- Carol.
- My mother?

My mother is texting you at 1:30
in the fucking morning?

Shit, that's not funny, is it?

I'm just playing.

It's Kate calling in sick
for her shift tomorrow.

I'm sorry, baby.

I-I don't really know what
happened on Shameless last week.

Call once you find out.

I'm home now.

Mandy, I know
you're seeing Lip.

But like I told him,
I think it's great.

You knew Karen
was in town, didn't you?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I have a problem
with you being here.

- What do you want?
- Take your clothes off.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- Do you have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.
Well, here's a good one.

Barista at the coffee beanery.

Jimmy.
Andy from med school.

You remember Adam Britt,
Nick Stathis, Mark.

We're grabbing dinner
tomorrow night.

You should join us.

She's gonna fuck the faggot
out of you, kid.

And you're goddamn gonna watch.

- Karen?
- Gasps

You told me you came home
to be with Hymie.

But you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Dead bolts, front and back.

Frank's not allowed in anymore.

Frank, I'm Chris.

Would you be my sponsor?

My previous sponsor moved out.

- What, he lived with you?
- Yeah.

I'm sorry. Let me introduce
myself properly.

Frank Gallagher.

Night, Frank.

Good night, Christopher.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends

they're not for naught

 You were willing

What do you think?

Great for a coke orgy,
not for an office job.

- This is my nicest dress.
- No, I know.

I didn't say
that it wasn't nice.

I just said you can't wear it
to an office.

You said "coke orgy."

- You okay?
- Uh, yeah, just tired.

- Didn't sleep well.
- Take a nap later.

Naps are for kids
and college students.

I gotta go to work.

- You sure I can't--
- 100% sure.

Baby squeals

Hey, you got an extra
one of those?

- You're gonna be late!
- Got nothing to wear.

Gonna see what V has.

Is your new job
at a strip club?

- Ha, ha.
- I wasn't kidding.

It's a temp office job,
so I don't know

how long the day's gonna be.

I expect all of you
to help Jimmy with dinner

and get your homework done
and generally avoid

setting the house on fire.

Overcompensating.

She feels guilty for
turning us into latchkey kids.

What's a latchkey kid?

Hey.

I left some stuff here
that I need.

Is it wrong if I just
leave for school?

Later.

Both laughing

Laughing

- What's funny?
- Garfield.

He's always so hungry.

Laughs

What are you reading about?

A bunch of uppity queers
claiming that

domestic partnership rights
are not good enough for them.

They get offended when
you call them queers, Frank.

Calling people
by their name is not,

nor should it ever,
be argued as offensive.

God almighty.

- You okay?
- No!

I'm a pauper, and somehow
I got the king's disease.

Gonorrhea?

Kings don't screw whores.

They screw virgins
or their nieces.

The king's disease is gout.

Big toe is throbbing
like blue balls

that no blowjob can ever fix.

You got any Percs or Vikes?

No, but I could call my doctor,

see if she can fit you in.

She's super nice.
Korean. Small fingers.

No, thank you.
Doctors are crooks,

especially the Korean ones.

Never trust a culture
that makes sausages from dogs.

Frank, I'm pretty sure
that's racist.

Accurate is not racist.

Write that down
in your AA journal.

Hold on.
You work for the city.

- Yeah.
- We live together.

You cook for me,
clean for me, shop for me.

That makes us family.

Oh, Frank, I'm touched.

We qualify for domestic
partnership rights.

I can use your insurance,
go to the lady doctor

with the small fingers
for free.

No. No, no.

Those laws do not apply to us.

Why not?

Why should our heterosexual
proclivities

prevent us
from collecting our due?

That is heterophobia,
and I won't stand for it.

You won't?

The squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

Write that down, Christopher.

You mean everything you said?

No.

Well, how much of it
did you mean?

I don't know-- I mean,
I meant a little bit of it.

You know, I think
there's some things that

we could stand to talk about,
but mostly, I just--

Was in douche land?

Not my choice of words, but--

Why does Karen Jackson
still have pictures of you

on her Facebook page?

I have no fucking idea.

Well, if there's nothing going
on between the two of you--

- Mandy, I don't go
on to Facebook, okay?

'Cause I don't give a shit
about whose pet just died

or who just checked in
at the fucking McDonald's.

She's a skanky,
manipulative bitch.

You should un-friend her.

Also, you have an appointment
this afternoon

with the alumni rep from MIT.

It's 3:30 here.

- What?
- It's a good thing.

It means you got past
the first round.

Yeah. No, no, no.
I know that.

But, um, I never applied
for MIT.

Yeah, you did.
Also Carnegie Mellon,

Northwestern, Columbia,
Stanford, and Penn.

Come on, I can't be late today.

Whoa, wait. Hang on.

You applied
to all those schools for me?

A few fallbacks, too,
just in case.

No, no. Wait.

This is perfect.
Where did you get this?

I used to do the sexy
librarian thing--

glasses, hair bun,
the whole bit.

But you need hose.
Those offices pump in the AC.

Oh, nah. I'm warm-blooded.
I'll be good.

Kev, do guys get PMS?

Are you asking me if I bleed
from my nuts once a month?

I'm asking if guys get their
own version of--

I don't know,
hormonal bullshit.

- Nope.
- Yes, he does.

- Do not.
- Remember when you broke

the TV remote last month
for no good reason?

It wouldn't fucking work.
That's a good reason.

We get weepy.
They get angry.

Jimmy doesn't
seem angry exactly.

- He seems quiet.
- Oh, God. Stop.

Would you stop right there?

We get quiet for one minute,
and you guys

think that we're obsessing
about the relationship.

And all we're thinking is,
"I wonder if

there's any more cheese."

You mean we make you smarter
than you are?

No, no, no.

You make us more interested
in you than we are.

Oh, don't mind him.

He's just mad 'cause somebody
cut off the tip of his penis

when he was too young
to defend himself.

V, don't start that shit!

What are we talking about?

Whether or not
to circumcise our baby.

- Are you-- wait. Is your mom--
- No, no one's pregnant.

And if somebody were pregnant,

it still may not even be a boy.

- But if it is a boy--
- If it is a boy,

you gotta circumcise.

I mean, have you ever
seen one that's uncut?

You don't know
what's going on up in there.

It does not make you
want to go downtown.

And you want your kid
to get his share of head, right?

Thank you!

Or not? Crap. Sorry.

Thanks for the suit.
Gotta go.

Bye. Love you. Okay.

Door shuts

Knock at door

- Morning.
- Morning, Jody.

Fiona said you guys
were gonna watch Liam today?

Uh, I gotta work.

But it'll be good
for Sheila to watch him.

Sheila, Debbie's here.

I gotta go, babe. Sit up.

Sitting up's a real good start.

I, uh-- I gotta go.

Sheila, are you okay?

I'm fine.

Of course, I'm-- I'm fine.

Fiona said you were gonna
watch Liam today.

Yes, that's fine.

It'll be nice to have a baby.

Good morning, mom.

Sighs

- Hi, Karen.
- Hey.

Have you had any breakfast?

Sobbing

- Snaps fingers
- Yo, chief.

I asked for
a bone-dry cappuccino.

This isn't bone-dry.

Oh, so you're talking about,
like,

the kind of bone that's been
left out in the sun?

'Cause living bones
are 35% water,

and they bleed
when you break them.

Are you freaking kidding me?

No, not you, man. Sorry.

Coffee shop boy
is giving me lip. Hang on.

Dude, when I spend as much
for a cup of coffee

as a gallon of gas,
I get it how I want it.

Remake it bone-dry, dirt-dry,
fucking desert-dry, okay?

- Do it now!
- Very sorry, sir.

We'll take care of that
right away.

Just do it.

I don't understand.
You really don't get

- why I have a problem with this?
- No.

- Really?
- No!

Ian, do you get
why I have a problem with this?

Not getting in the middle.

Why are you being
such a dick about this?

Those applications
are 90 pages long.

It took me forever
to fill them out.

Walk the fuck away.

- Wow. You're--
- What? I'm what?

You're not my mother.

You're not in charge
of who I talk to

or who has a picture of me
on Facebook.

And you're sure as shit
not in charge

of if I go to college!

You think he's right?

Men are never right.

That's why women were invented,

to think for you assholes.

I mean, look at Mickey, marrying
some whore he knocked up.

What?

Men are weak and stupid,
even the good ones.

I mean, especially
the good ones.

And I'm not gonna
watch Lip fuck up his life

the way that Mickey's
fucking up his.

School bell chimes

Hey, Sheila, I made you some
cinnamon toast and coffee.

Cinnamon toast and coffee
always makes me

feel a little better
when I'm down.

It's just, you have to sit up
to eat it.

- Sobs
- Come on, Sheila.

Sit up.
You'll feel better, I promise.

Sobs

You the temp?

Yeah, hi. Yes.
Fiona Gallagher.

Nice to meet you, Fiona.
I'm Connie.

We're all
on a first-name basis here.

It's a family-run company,
real friendly place.

- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Follow me.

You'll be covering for Maria.

She's a cold caller
in our marketing department.

And last week, Friday,
she was having cramps,

but it wasn't
her time of the month.

And I told her not to ignore it,
but did she listen?

Appendicitis. She barely
made it there in time.

Honest, it was about to burst.
And then who knows?

- Wow, that's--
- Yeah, so, if you're

having cramps
on your left side,

and it's not
your time of the month,

you shouldn't ignore it,
or you could very well die.

- That's good to know.
- Isn't it?

You can drop your bag there,
and I'll show you around.

- Okay.
- That's the copy room,

the warehouse, the kitchen,
treadmill, water cooler.

That's the fridge.
Anything with a label on it

belongs to somebody else,
except for the yogurts.

Margie never labels them
because everyone

just knows she's always
on a diet.

So if you know
what's good for you--

Stay away from the yogurt.
Got it.

But the donuts on the table
are fair game.

Fair game as in free?

We all take turns buying a box.

But you're a temp,
so you can just have one.

That's the bathroom,
women's room.

Once you get settled in,

you'll be making calls
from this list.

And you'll read
from this script.

It's real simple.
You'll start here.

And if they say this,
you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

You get the idea?

You're calling customers
who haven't

placed an order for a while.

So if you get a bite,
you transfer them

straight away to sales
by pressing this button.

They'll close the deal.

So, uh, I'm the fluffer
and they're the happy ending?

I'm sorry, uh--

I have a lot of brothers.

All right.

I'll be over there,
if you have any questions.

Sighs

What do you mean,
living together for a year?

What kind of a rule is that?

We call that rule a law.

Well, it just so happens,
I was mistaken.

Christopher and I have been
living together

for a year, well over a year.

Sir, if you just
let me explain--

And just because my name
isn't on the utility bill,

that is no reason to deny me
my basic civil rights.

Sir, I'm just trying
to explain to you what we have--

My partner has been
working hard killing dogs

for this city
for close to a decade.

- You kill dogs?
- Animal control.

I know my rights.

Sir, I cannot award you
domestic partnership status

unless you have proof
that you are and have been

financially and emotionally
interdependent partners

for over a year.

Joint tenancy documents
verifying--

- I know my rights.

Do you not understand
that I get 150 of you people

in here a day spouting
this same shit at me?

"You people"? What can
that mean, "you people"?

- Oh, no, we're not like that.
- You're not like what?

We are not the kind of people
you can push around

with your homophobic rhetoric.

Where are you going?
I'm still talking!

I'm going on break.

That's my civil right!

Fucking-- let's go.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

We've noticed that you haven't
renewed your order in a while.

And I was wondering
if I could transfer you

to our sales dep--

Oh, no? Huh.

Well, that's really shitty.

Yeah, no, I get it.

I had a mailman at home
like that, a real seedy dude.

It looked like he was
casing the joint

every time he dropped off
a package.

I got so fed up,
that I called the post office

and, you know, I had them
take him off my route.

Now we have this great lady,
Josephine, really nice.

I bet if you call and complain,
they'll switch him out for you.

But either way,
they'll want to hear about it.

Great. Yes,
I will transfer you now.

Good luck.

Clears throat

Hey. They had a rude
delivery guy, so I--

I heard. It's just--
if they say this, you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

- You stick to the script.
- I got it.

Sorry. It won't happen again.

Okay.

Cell phone ringing

Hello?

What?

Oh, yes, Debbie is home sick
from school today.

Thank you.

Sighs

Are you ready?

Yeah, I'm just not into
this setup.

- I look weak.
- It's gimp porn, babe.

You're supposed to look weak.

Am I also supposed to look fat?

Jeez, you sound like a woman.

Maybe it's because someone
cut off part of your manhood

when you were too young
to defend yourself.

I just don't want to do
the gimp thing.

Do you know how expensive
a kid is, Kev?

Sack it up.

Phone ringing

Hey, Fi.

Hey, can you pop over
to the house

and see if Debbie's there?

I don't know
if she's really sick

or if she's skipping or what.

All right,
I'll go check on her.

But you have to go
to www.dontcutitoff.org

- What?
- I'm serious, Fiona.

Go to that website
and see if you stand by your

"I want my son to get
his share of head" argument.

Do not do it, Fiona.

dontcutitoff.org, promise.
Promise!

- Okay. Okay, okay. I'll do it.
- All right, bye.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

Vote Paul Lashmet
for a better Chicago.

Hope I can count on your vote.

Nice to meet you.

Baby cries

Can't you shut the baby up?

I could shove her up your ass
and see if that does it.

You need to learn respect
for your elders.

You need to learn
to not be a total dickwad.

I have a plan to put Chicago
back to work.

Hey. Hey. Over here.

I know you can hear me,
Mr. Give-Me-Your-Vote!

You want to know
what's wrong with this city?

You want
to know what doesn't work?

My wife and I got married
after three weeks of dating,

and she turned out to be
a bipolar drug addict-- easy--

who left me alone
with six kids to raise,

while my domestic partner,

Mr. Christopher Collier,
is a clean and sober,

hardworking citizen
of this country.

I think he deserves
the same rights

as a woman who would
abandon her children.

Thank you, sir. And I will
consider your situation.

Don't you turn your back on me.

- Oh, don't you worry.
- I'm a citizen of this country.

I live in this city.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits.

Which means for me,
it's stand in the line

at the free clinic or suffer.

That's not only unfair
and unchristian,

it's flat out un-American.

I'm a citizen.

Where are my equal rights?

Fix that,
Mr. I-Want-To-Be-Mayor.

Fuck.

Thank you so much.

I'll transfer you now.

Cell phone chimes

Sighs _

I like this color.

Kind of cheers you up
just looking at it, right?

It does.

Sometimes when
you're feeling really bad,

if you make yourself
look better on the outside,

it can start to make you
feel better on the inside.

My mom calls it,
"taking it from the outside in."

Jackson residence.

Debbie, you were just supposed
to drop Liam there.

Why aren't you at school?
Are you sick?

Uh, code pink.

- Monica's home?
- No, no, no.

Code pink at Sheila's.

- I'll explain later, okay?
- Fine, explain later.

But you're in big trouble.

Sighs

What's a code pink?

It's nothing.

I was just trying
to explain to Fiona

why I'm not at school.

It's like a code word we have.

Oh, no. What time is it?

Are you skipping school
because of me?

I didn't want to go anyway.

All anyone ever does
is try to copy off me.

But no one wants
to sit with me at lunch.

Everybody's mean.
Middle school's stupid.

Mean girls suck.

My daughter's a mean girl.

I don't know how it happened.

It's not your fault.

But I'm her mother.

If how we turn out
is all about how our mother is,

then I'm pretty screwed, right?

Both moaning

Laughing

- What's funny?
- It's just--

she applied to colleges for you.

Wow, I'm so glad my cock
thrust up inside of you

is holding your attention
so well.

That's really nice for me.

Sorry, I just--
I don't get it.

Why don't you just dump her?

Less talking, more riding.

Both moaning

Is Mickey seriously
getting married?

Yeah. Like,
in a couple of weeks.

Jesus. To who?

I-I didn't even know
he was seeing anyone.

Well, I don't think
he was seeing her

so much as he was doing her.

- So why's he marrying her?
- She's knocked up.

So? I don't get it.

What, is your dad making him?

I don't know.

Why do you give a shit?

Indistinct chatter

Sighs

Don't you turn your back on me.

- It's flat out un-American.

- Frank?
- You know him?

Where are my equal rights?

You could say that.
He's my dad.

I-- wow, that speech.

Your father-- I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.

Oh, my God, I wish
I could turn back time.

Turn back time? Why?

Some of the office bitches
may have narc-ed on you

about the porn at your desk
and the personal phone calls.

And by office bitches,
I might mean myself.

Porn at my desk?

Oh, shit.

Fiona. Hi.

So Mr. Pratt is asking
for a word with you.

- Let me guess. He's the boss?
- No, no.

He's one of the cousins.

Not the big boss,
but he is a supervisor, yes.

Really, very sorry.

Knock at door Yes?

Hi. Fiona Gallagher.

The temp?

Oh, Fiona, yeah.

Um, go ahead and have a seat.

Go ahead, sorry.

So I've had some complaints
about your language,

a few personal calls
on company time--

- I have five kids.

They're my siblings,
but I raise them.

And one of them skipped school.

So I'm sorry
about the personal calls,

but it was really
only a couple minutes.

And I'm happy to clock out early
and work late.

Oh, no.
You don't have to do that.

There were some photos.

Yeah, the porn at my desk?

It wasn't really porn.

It was pictures of penises,

but it was
from a circumcision website.

See, friends of mine
are trying for a baby.

And I had said a thing about
how they should

circumcise the baby so that
girls will be more likely

to want to--
uh, with their mouths.

Not on the baby, of course.

I mean once he's a grown-up.

Shit.

Am I fired?

No, you're-- Clears throat
Sorry.

My silence here is not
so much about disapproval

as it is trying to find a way

to participate
in this conversation

that won't leave me vulnerable
to a lawsuit,

'cause I would like to say that
I am a little shocked

to learn that, um, circumcision,
or a lack thereof,

would affect a woman's
willingness to--

Clears throat

I can't say that.

I can't say anything, really.

I've said too much already.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't sue me.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't fire me.

Deal. But, hey,
I'm putting my foot down.

No more naked body parts
at your desk for any reason.

Both laugh
Shit. Sorry.

And watch your language,
like you're in church.

- Got it.
- And also,

you're doing a great job.

Scoffs I'm what?

I got a call from
one of our sales reps.

You apparently convinced
a high-volume customer

that we thought
we'd lost to re-up.

Something about a delivery man?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Well, anyway, great work.
And keep it up.

Do me a favor.
Don't go out there smiling.

You'll help me maintain
that reputation as a hard-ass.

You have a reputation
as a hard-ass?

No.

I really want one, though.

Laughs
Hey. Mm-mm.

_

- What's this?
- Payday.

Oh, sweet!

It's $218.

I worked 40 hours
at $10 an hour.

That's $400.

Yeah, minus taxes.

Oh, and minus the free refills

you've been giving your
little boyfriend over there.

My what? No, that's my--
I barely know him.

He's here when you're here
and he's not when you're not.

And you give him free refills.

You think I don't see?
I see.

Phillip?

Scott Walker, MIT Alumni Rep.

We had an appointment at 3:30.
It's nearly 4:00.

Right, yeah. Look,
I'm sorry you came and waited,

but I'm not interested.

You're not interested in MIT?

- No.
- Oh, that's too bad.

I was really curious
to interview the kid

with the 4.6 GPA
who so blatantly

plagiarized
his application essay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
I didn't plagiarize anything.

She plagiarized Nelson Mandela.
Jesus.

She?

Yeah, my girlfriend
wrote this application.

I'm guessing she Googled
"good speeches" and

picked one that sounded
smartest to her.

I'm surprised she didn't
go with "I have a dream."

Well, you sure you
don't want to do the interview?

- I'm already here.
- No, thanks.

- I hate Boston. Red Sox suck.
- Okay.

It's unlikely you could have
gotten in anyway.

Laughs

What is that,
reverse psychology?

Let me guess,
you minored in psych,

thinking it would give you a leg
up in business negotiations.

You may have a 4.6,
but you also required

a three semester senior year
due to truancy.

And competition is pretty
intense if you require

a full scholarship,
which I'm guessing that you do.

Wow, why don't you
just go ahead

and call me white trash
while you're at it?

Competition's tougher
at this level, that's all.

At this level. Jesus.
Give me a fucking pen.

Frank.

Frank. Frank, why?

Why would you? Why?
Sighs

My coworkers teased me so much

I had to pretend
that I was sick.

Then my mother called.

She almost had a cardiac episode
she was so upset.

I only convinced her last year
that I'm not gay.

It took me years, Frank, years.

Why would you do this?

Why, Frank, why?

The fuck are you talking about?

You told the world we're gay!

It's all over Twitter.

It's all over Facebook.

It was on the 12:00 news.

What?

You're famous
for being gay, Frank.

Are you gay?
Are you, really?

Phone ringing

I am whatever I need to be
at the time I need to be it.

Christ, write that down.

Mom.

Yes, mom, I'm talking to him.

No, mom, I am not-- mom.

Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

Dude, I'm telling you,
this is my car.

- It has a kid's seat in it.
- I don't give a shit.

Look at that chip
right there, man.

That diamond-shaped scratch,
I did that the night

we had too many Jaeger bombs.
Remember?

Hell, I still
got the keys, man.

Both laugh

I found my stolen car, bitch.

Well, what are you waiting
for? Call the cops.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you. Sorry.

Passing by,
couldn't help but overhear.

I'd just take it home.

Cops keep it in evidence for,
like, a year.

- You're right.
- Yeah.

He's right, man. Plus,
insurance already covered it,

so this is, like,
found money, bitch.

Why is that man
driving your car?

- Because it's stolen.
- You let him steal it?

No, Beto. I stole it,

back when life was fun
and the world had meaning.

You gonna punish me for it?

You want to break
another finger?

How about a toe?

Maybe cut off
a couple earlobes?

Stick a fork in my eye?

Rock music



Cheers and applause

Saw you on the news, Frank.

- About time you came out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Have your fun.
Just pour me a goddamn drink.

Don't do it, Kate.
We don't need

- his AIDS germs in here.
- Screw you, Tommy.

- You wish.
- Are you really gay now, Frank?

What is gay, Kermit?
Gay is a state of mind.

It is a mood.

Gay is when you part
the ass cheeks of another man

and use your dick
as a divining rod.

Well, by that definition, no,
then I'm not gay.

Then what are you doing
going on the news,

talking about gay rights?

I was trying to get
insurance coverage.

Hey, Frank, how do you fit
three homos on a barstool?

You turn it upside down!

Laughter

Kate, I leave it to you
to rise above

this homophobic rhetoric

and offer me recompense
in the form of whiskey.

It's only homophobia
when they're afraid of you.

I'm pretty sure
they just don't like you.

Come on, just give me
a drink anyway--

- You maxed out your tab, Frank.
- Hey.

What does one gay say to another
one going on vacation?

"Can I help you
pack your shit?"

Laughter

Kermit, that joke is so
hackneyed, you owe me a drink.

What's the difference between
a refrigerator and a fag?

The fridge doesn't fart
when you pull the meat out!

Laughter

All: Oh, no.

Clears throat

Your insipid essay question
asks me to tell you

in 250 words about my most
significant challenge in life.

Honestly,
it's hard to pick one.

My guess is that
you want to hear about

my alcoholic father and
my runaway mom or maybe about--

You would eat that shit up.

But those aren't
my greatest challenges in life.

An education system that
pretends to be a meritocracy--

What would you want to study
at MIT?

Provided you could get past
my well-meaning oblivion

and the proximity
of the Red Sox.

Robotics.

But none of that undergrad
filler bullshit.

No 200-seat lectures
taught by TAS.

I just want the shit
out in front of me.

The shit?

Yeah, the tools, you know,
the toys,

the stuff I can't get access
to in my ghetto high school.

Why?

Because I'd like to hang out
with C-3PO in my lifetime.

And at the rate you're going,
that shit's not gonna happen.

I'm not following.

You don't want
to go to classes,

you just want to play in a lab?

I don't want to sit in
a lecture that teaches me

how to modify algorithms
instead of think for myself.

And?

Okay, the people working
the weaving machines

in the 17th century, you know,

they didn't see
the steam engine coming.

One invention.
Industrial revolution.

I mean, Encyclopedia Britannica
didn't see Wikipedia coming.

Great things don't happen
in tiny little increments.

You know, they happen when

someone thinks completely
differently.

And all you geniuses,
you just--

you're just
modifying algorithms.

C-3PO, huh?

That dude's a badass.

You know, he's fluent in over

6 million
forms of communication.

Give me the money.

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

Give me your money.

Is that a toy gun?

- What's with him?
- No idea.

He's been weird all day.

You, um-- you plagiarized
Nelson Mandela.

Who?

The MIT application essay.

Oh, you think I should have
wrote it myself?

No. I think
you shouldn't have

applied to colleges for me
without asking me.

I did ask you.

I asked you, like, 100 times
to get the applications in,

- and you ignored me.
- For a reason.

What reason,
that you're an idiot?

That you want
to waste your life laying around

in this shit-hole neighborhood
forever?

You have any idea
how much stuff

I had to steal and sell
to pay those application fees?

It was a huge pain in the ass,
and I did it for you.

So you could be a little bit
nicer about it.

You know, you might even
want to say thank you.

Thank you.

Both moaning

Thank you. Thank you!

Both grunting

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

May I transfer you to sales?

Thank you so much.

And you have a Worldwide day.

Hey, Fiona. You okay?

Huh? Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Mike's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

Maria got an infection
in the hospital.

She's gonna be out for at least
a couple more weeks.

I-I was thinking of requesting
you, if you're available.

Easier than training
a new girl every day.

That'd be great.

Only thing is,
Mr. Pratt, Sr.

Uncle Matt, we call him,
he's kind of conservative.

He's a deacon at First Baptist.

I'm sure that outfit
would have been great

at your last office, but--

Shit, really? Gasps Shit.

Oh, fuck-- mm. Sorry.

It's okay.
Just button up a little bit

and it'll all be all right.

Rock music

Please tell your father
I'm a big fan.



- It's truth, you see?
- What's truth?

That you are no good for Fiona.

What the hell do you know?

I know you
are not meant for this life.

You are a rich boy,
born with a silver spoon, eh?

It's okay not to be ashamed.

I am from the favela.
Okay?

And now I have silver spoon.
You can go that way.

But the other way?
Scoffs

That way is just misery.

Bitter. Resent. Miseria.

It's better you should go now,
before Fiona and

the kids get more, uh,
what's the--

- Attached.
- Attached, yes.

Or before you and Fiona
make a baby together.

'Cause after a baby,

then it's misery, bitter,
resent forever.

Men, we need space to think.

So walk, think.

This time,
I will not follow you.

Thanks, man.

Hey, but if you break any laws,

I will chop off
both your hands, eh?

I got it.

You use that Mandela speech
in all the applications?

No, mixed it up a little bit.

Couple of dead presidents
and some guy called "Gandy."

Gandhi?

I don't get why
you'd want me to go to MIT.

You know,
Boston's pretty far away.

I thought maybe you'd take me
with you, but--

But what?

No one's ever been
as good to me as you have.

You're better than this
neighborhood.

You're better
than anyone I've ever met.

And you deserve to get out--

even if you
don't take me with you,

which I never really
thought you would anyway.

So is it true?

You're getting married?

So who is it?
Is it Angie Zahgo

or some other piece of trash
you screw so you can pretend

I don't matter to you?

Hey, what the fuck, Gallagher?
Glass shatters

Oh, he speaks!

So that's it. We're over.

Your dad beats the shit
out of us,

and you're just gonna
get married, no conversation?

Nothing?

Get the fuck off me.

Oh, you want to fag bash?

That make you feel like a man?

Come on. Go ahead!
Do it!

Grunts

Fuck.

Oh, just the man
I was hoping to run into.

I can't see you anymore.

I'm with Mandy now.

Sorry, I, uh...

I shouldn't have started up
with you again.

You're not serious.

She's good for me,
and you're not.

And, uh...

yeah, that's all.

What about boys?

What about them?

- Well, do you like any?
- None that like me.

I'm not pretty like Fiona.

My teeth are messed up,
and my chest is flat.

You know, they have
special bras for that.

Door slams shut

- Hey.
- Hey, Karen.

Um, is there anything to eat?

Mom?

Jesus. What-fucking-ever!

Clatter Hey!

Stomping upstairs

What did she do that's so bad
that you won't talk to her?

She wrote the Wongs and
told them to take Hymie away.

She told them I was crazy and

that I had Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder

and that
I was bad for the baby.

I do have
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,

but I-I've been working
really hard to treat it.

And my meds have been
really working.

And I am a little crazy,

but I'm not bad for that baby.

That part's just not true.

Sheila?

Yeah, honey?

I've seen crazy,
and I've seen bad for kids.

You aren't
either of those things.

You're super nice.

I've made a lot of mistakes.

Then say you're sorry.

Because if Monica came back,
said she was sorry,

and stayed...
I'd forgive her.

I would forgive her
for everything,

because she's my mom.

I'm so...

sorry your mom left you.

But you-- you know
it's not your fault, right?

Do you know that?
It's not your fault.

It's Karen Jackson.
I just wanted to call

and say thank you for
applying to colleges for Lip.

- What?
- My mom kind of sucks

these days, so it'll be awesome
to have somewhere new to go.

And all I have to do
is poke one hole in a condom,

and he'll do
whatever I say forever.

I mean, we learned that
from last time.

Fuck you.

Oh, you mean, like,
all three of us?

Yeah, I could be down for that.

Do you want me to ask Lip
next time we do it?

 Aren't you the one
who tried to hurt me

 when you said good-bye?

 Did you think I'd crumble?

 Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

 Oh, no, not I

 I will survive  Oh, yeah.

All:  Oh, as long
as I know how to love

 I know I'll stay alive

 I've got
all my life to live

 I've got
all my love to give

 I will survive
I will survive

or a rock.
Do you have a rock?

I give really good blowjobs.

Are you sure you don't want one?

Do you know how many
nerve endings

are in the foreskin of a penis?

I don't think there's
a single guy who wishes

he had more nerves down there.

Well, what if our son
wants to be a transsexual?

They will need that skin
to make him a proper vagina.

Why is that even a question?

The gays brought
the gift baskets, Kevin.

Look at all the gift baskets.

I'm saying, it's a possibility.

What's all this?

Frank told the world he's gay.

And the gay world responded
with chocolate and cheese.

- And good wine.
- Wow.

Debs, school,
why didn't you go?

Sheila was depressed,
like, bad depressed.

- Monica depressed.
- Code pink.

I'm sorry
you had to deal with that.

- Is Frank really gay?
- No. Laughs

Carl, it's a scam.
It's always some kind of scam.

This scam tastes awesome.

Is this dinner?

- Where's Jimmy?
- I don't know.

Think he's still wondering
if there's any more cheese?

- Laughs
- Try the moldy one.

- I like the one with the holes.
- Hey, put that down.

- Wipe your mouth afterwards.

And I'm sorry
that I missed so many

of your school events because
I couldn't leave the house.

And I--

I'm sorry that I-I took up
with your husband,

even if you didn't want him.

It's just a-- well, just
a terrible thing

for a mother to do.

There-- there are so many ways
I wish I--

I could have been

and have a chat.

What'd you hit?

Girl at school.

Don't forget to check for hair
behind the grill.

Call Manny
about the windshield.

We've looked into
your records, Frank.

You're an alcoholic,
a derelict.

Not the kind of man
we usually want on our side.

But you, my friend, have
stumbled ass over Teakettle

into the most
significant moment

in the history
of the gay rights movement.

We both know that
we're not second-class citizens,

but there are a lot of people
in this country

who still need convincing.

And you are the missing piece
in our puzzle.

You blue-collar, working-class,
Irish-Catholic.

You have the ears of the people

whose minds most need changing.

You also have dog shit on
your face and no place to live,

but we can fix that
if you agree to work with us.

You've got my attention, Mr.--

Paige. Abraham Paige.

We'll clean you up.
We'll house you.

We'll coach you.

Do you remember
"Joe The Plumber"?

Heard of him?
He's a personal hero of mine.

Well, you are gay Joe.

- Frank the plumber?
- No.

Frank, the father.

Frank, the son.
Frank, the neighbor.

Frank, the face
of the gay-rights movement.

Oh, jeez.

- Oh.
- Take it.

- Ow.
- Take it. This shit. Yeah.

- Ow.
- Take it, you little gimp.

Turn over.
Mama's gonna give you an exam.

Groans

- Take it.
- Ow.

- Take it.
- Ow.

Don't you shit on my hand.
You hear me?

- Yeah. Ooh. Take it.
- Ow.

Yeah.

Ah!

Both moaning





I-I don't really know what
happened on Shameless last week.

Call once you find out.

I'm home now.

Mandy, I know
you're seeing Lip.

But like I told him,
I think it's great.

You knew Karen
was in town, didn't you?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I have a problem
with you being here.

- What do you want?
- Take your clothes off.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- Do you have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.
Well, here's a good one.

You remember Adam Britt,

We're grabbing dinner

You should join us.

She's gonna fuck the faggot
out of you, kid.

And you're goddamn gonna watch.

- Karen?
- Gasps

You told me you came home
to be with Hymie.

But you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Kings don't screw whores.

They screw virgins
or their nieces.

The king's disease is gout.

Big toe is throbbing
like blue balls

that no blowjob can ever fix.

You got any Percs or Vikes?

No, but I could call my doctor,

see if she can fit you in.

She's super nice.
Korean. Small fingers.

No, thank you.
Doctors are crooks,

especially the Korean ones.

Never trust a culture
that makes sausages from dogs.

Frank, I'm pretty sure
that's racist.

Accurate is not racist.

Write that down
in your AA journal.

Hold on.
You work for the city.

- Yeah.
- We live together.

You cook for me,
clean for me, shop for me.

That makes us family.

Oh, Frank, I'm touched.

We qualify for domestic
partnership rights.

I can use your insurance,
go to the lady doctor

with the small fingers
for free.

No. No, no.

Those laws do not apply to us.

Why not?

Why should our heterosexual
proclivities

prevent us
from collecting our due?

That is heterophobia,
and I won't stand for it.

You won't?

The squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

Write that down, Christopher.

You mean everything you said?

No.

Well, how much of it
did you mean?

I don't know-- I mean,
I meant a little bit of it.

You know, I think
there's some things that

we could stand to talk about,
but mostly, I just--

Was in douche land?

Not my choice of words, but--

Why does Karen Jackson
still have pictures of you

on her Facebook page?

I have no fucking idea.

Well, if there's nothing going
on between the two of you--

- Mandy, I don't go
on to Facebook, okay?

'Cause I don't give a shit
about whose pet just died

or who just checked in
at the fucking McDonald's.

She's a skanky,
manipulative bitch.

You should un-friend her.

Also, you have an appointment
this afternoon

with the alumni rep from MIT.

It's 3:30 here.

- What?
- It's a good thing.

It means you got past
the first round.

Yeah. No, no, no.
I know that.

But, um, I never applied
for MIT.

Yeah, you did.
Also Carnegie Mellon,

Northwestern, Columbia,
Stanford, and Penn.

Come on, I can't be late today.

Whoa, wait. Hang on.

You applied
to all those schools for me?

A few fallbacks, too,
just in case.

No, no. Wait.

This is perfect.
Where did you get this?

I used to do the sexy
librarian thing--

glasses, hair bun,
the whole bit.

But you need hose.
Those offices pump in the AC.

Oh, nah. I'm warm-blooded.
I'll be good.

Kev, do guys get PMS?

Are you asking me if I bleed
from my nuts once a month?

I'm asking if guys get their
own version of--

I don't know,
hormonal bullshit.

- Nope.
- Yes, he does.

- Do not.
- Remember when you broke

the TV remote last month
for no good reason?

It wouldn't fucking work.
That's a good reason.

We get weepy.
They get angry.

Jimmy doesn't
seem angry exactly.

- He seems quiet.
- Oh, God. Stop.

Would you stop right there?

We get quiet for one minute,
and you guys

think that we're obsessing
about the relationship.

And all we're thinking is,
"I wonder if

there's any more cheese."

You mean we make you smarter
than you are?

No, no, no.

You make us more interested
in you than we are.

Oh, don't mind him.

He's just mad 'cause somebody
cut off the tip of his penis

when he was too young
to defend himself.

V, don't start that shit!

What are we talking about?

Whether or not
to circumcise our baby.

- Are you-- wait. Is your mom--
- No, no one's pregnant.

And if somebody were pregnant,

it still may not even be a boy.

- But if it is a boy--
- If it is a boy,

you gotta circumcise.

I mean, have you ever
seen one that's uncut?

You don't know
what's going on up in there.

It does not make you
want to go downtown.

And you want your kid
to get his share of head, right?

Thank you!

Or not? Crap. Sorry.

Thanks for the suit.
Gotta go.

Bye. Love you. Okay.

Door shuts

Knock at door

- Morning.
- Morning, Jody.

Fiona said you guys
were gonna watch Liam today?

Uh, I gotta work.

But it'll be good
for Sheila to watch him.

Sheila, Debbie's here.

I gotta go, babe. Sit up.

Sitting up's a real good start.

I, uh-- I gotta go.

Sheila, are you okay?

I'm fine.

Of course, I'm-- I'm fine.

Fiona said you were gonna
watch Liam today.

Yes, that's fine.

It'll be nice to have a baby.

Good morning, mom.

Sighs

- Hi, Karen.
- Hey.

Have you had any breakfast?

Sobbing

- Snaps fingers
- Yo, chief.

I asked for
a bone-dry cappuccino.

This isn't bone-dry.

Oh, so you're talking about,
like,

the kind of bone that's been
left out in the sun?

'Cause living bones
are 35% water,

and they bleed
when you break them.

Are you freaking kidding me?

No, not you, man. Sorry.

Coffee shop boy
is giving me lip. Hang on.

Dude, when I spend as much
for a cup of coffee

as a gallon of gas,
I get it how I want it.

Remake it bone-dry, dirt-dry,
fucking desert-dry, okay?

- Do it now!
- Very sorry, sir.

We'll take care of that
right away.

Just do it.

I don't understand.
You really don't get

- why I have a problem with this?
- No.

- Really?
- No!

Ian, do you get
why I have a problem with this?

Not getting in the middle.

Why are you being
such a dick about this?

Those applications
are 90 pages long.

It took me forever
to fill them out.

Walk the fuck away.

- Wow. You're--
- What? I'm what?

You're not my mother.

You're not in charge
of who I talk to

or who has a picture of me
on Facebook.

And you're sure as shit
not in charge

of if I go to college!

You think he's right?

Men are never right.

That's why women were invented,

to think for you assholes.

I mean, look at Mickey, marrying
some whore he knocked up.

What?

Men are weak and stupid,
even the good ones.

I mean, especially
the good ones.

And I'm not gonna
watch Lip fuck up his life

the way that Mickey's
fucking up his.

School bell chimes

Hey, Sheila, I made you some
cinnamon toast and coffee.

Cinnamon toast and coffee
always makes me

feel a little better
when I'm down.

It's just, you have to sit up
to eat it.

- Sobs
- Come on, Sheila.

Sit up.
You'll feel better, I promise.

Sobs

You the temp?

Yeah, hi. Yes.
Fiona Gallagher.

Nice to meet you, Fiona.
I'm Connie.

We're all
on a first-name basis here.

It's a family-run company,
real friendly place.

- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Follow me.

You'll be covering for Maria.

She's a cold caller
in our marketing department.

And last week, Friday,
she was having cramps,

but it wasn't
her time of the month.

And I told her not to ignore it,
but did she listen?

Appendicitis. She barely
made it there in time.

Honest, it was about to burst.
And then who knows?

- Wow, that's--
- Yeah, so, if you're

having cramps
on your left side,

and it's not
your time of the month,

you shouldn't ignore it,
or you could very well die.

- That's good to know.
- Isn't it?

You can drop your bag there,
and I'll show you around.

- Okay.
- That's the copy room,

the warehouse, the kitchen,
treadmill, water cooler.

That's the fridge.
Anything with a label on it

belongs to somebody else,
except for the yogurts.

Margie never labels them
because everyone

just knows she's always
on a diet.

So if you know
what's good for you--

Stay away from the yogurt.
Got it.

But the donuts on the table
are fair game.

Fair game as in free?

We all take turns buying a box.

But you're a temp,
so you can just have one.

That's the bathroom,
women's room.

Once you get settled in,

you'll be making calls
from this list.

And you'll read
from this script.

It's real simple.
You'll start here.

And if they say this,
you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

You get the idea?

You're calling customers
who haven't

placed an order for a while.

So if you get a bite,
you transfer them

straight away to sales
by pressing this button.

They'll close the deal.

So, uh, I'm the fluffer
and they're the happy ending?

I'm sorry, uh--

I have a lot of brothers.

All right.

I'll be over there,
if you have any questions.

Sighs

What do you mean,
living together for a year?

What kind of a rule is that?

We call that rule a law.

Well, it just so happens,
I was mistaken.

Christopher and I have been
living together

for a year, well over a year.

Sir, if you just
let me explain--

And just because my name
isn't on the utility bill,

that is no reason to deny me
my basic civil rights.

Sir, I'm just trying
to explain to you what we have--

My partner has been
working hard killing dogs

for this city
for close to a decade.

- You kill dogs?
- Animal control.

I know my rights.

Sir, I cannot award you
domestic partnership status

unless you have proof
that you are and have been

financially and emotionally
interdependent partners

for over a year.

Joint tenancy documents
verifying--

- I know my rights.

Do you not understand
that I get 150 of you people

in here a day spouting
this same shit at me?

"You people"? What can
that mean, "you people"?

- Oh, no, we're not like that.
- You're not like what?

We are not the kind of people
you can push around

with your homophobic rhetoric.

Where are you going?
I'm still talking!

I'm going on break.

That's my civil right!

Fucking-- let's go.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

We've noticed that you haven't
renewed your order in a while.

And I was wondering
if I could transfer you

to our sales dep--

Oh, no? Huh.

Well, that's really shitty.

Yeah, no, I get it.

I had a mailman at home
like that, a real seedy dude.

It looked like he was
casing the joint

every time he dropped off
a package.

I got so fed up,
that I called the post office

and, you know, I had them
take him off my route.

Now we have this great lady,
Josephine, really nice.

I bet if you call and complain,
they'll switch him out for you.

But either way,
they'll want to hear about it.

Great. Yes,
I will transfer you now.

Good luck.

Clears throat

Hey. They had a rude
delivery guy, so I--

I heard. It's just--
if they say this, you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

- You stick to the script.
- I got it.

Sorry. It won't happen again.

Okay.

Cell phone ringing

Hello?

What?

Oh, yes, Debbie is home sick
from school today.

Thank you.

Sighs

Are you ready?

Yeah, I'm just not into
this setup.

- I look weak.
- It's gimp porn, babe.

You're supposed to look weak.

Am I also supposed to look fat?

Jeez, you sound like a woman.

Maybe it's because someone
cut off part of your manhood

when you were too young
to defend yourself.

I just don't want to do
the gimp thing.

Do you know how expensive
a kid is, Kev?

Sack it up.

Phone ringing

Hey, Fi.

Hey, can you pop over
to the house

and see if Debbie's there?

I don't know
if she's really sick

or if she's skipping or what.

All right,
I'll go check on her.

But you have to go
to www.dontcutitoff.org

- What?
- I'm serious, Fiona.

Go to that website
and see if you stand by your

"I want my son to get
his share of head" argument.

Do not do it, Fiona.

dontcutitoff.org, promise.
Promise!

- Okay. Okay, okay. I'll do it.
- All right, bye.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

Vote Paul Lashmet
for a better Chicago.

Hope I can count on your vote.

Nice to meet you.

Baby cries

Can't you shut the baby up?

I could shove her up your ass
and see if that does it.

You need to learn respect
for your elders.

You need to learn
to not be a total dickwad.

I have a plan to put Chicago
back to work.

Hey. Hey. Over here.

I know you can hear me,
Mr. Give-Me-Your-Vote!

You want to know
what's wrong with this city?

You want
to know what doesn't work?

My wife and I got married
after three weeks of dating,

and she turned out to be
a bipolar drug addict-- easy--

who left me alone
with six kids to raise,

while my domestic partner,

Mr. Christopher Collier,
is a clean and sober,

hardworking citizen
of this country.

I think he deserves
the same rights

as a woman who would
abandon her children.

Thank you, sir. And I will
consider your situation.

Don't you turn your back on me.

- Oh, don't you worry.
- I'm a citizen of this country.

I live in this city.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits.

Which means for me,
it's stand in the line

at the free clinic or suffer.

That's not only unfair
and unchristian,

it's flat out un-American.

I'm a citizen.

Where are my equal rights?

Fix that,
Mr. I-Want-To-Be-Mayor.

Fuck.

Thank you so much.

I'll transfer you now.

Cell phone chimes

Sighs _

I like this color.

Kind of cheers you up
just looking at it, right?

It does.

Sometimes when
you're feeling really bad,

if you make yourself
look better on the outside,

it can start to make you
feel better on the inside.

My mom calls it,
"taking it from the outside in."

Phone ringing

Mumbles

Phone ringing

Jackson residence.

Debbie, you were just supposed
to drop Liam there.

Why aren't you at school?
Are you sick?

Uh, code pink.

- Monica's home?
- No, no, no.

Code pink at Sheila's.

- I'll explain later, okay?
- Fine, explain later.

But you're in big trouble.

Sighs

What's a code pink?

It's nothing.

I was just trying
to explain to Fiona

why I'm not at school.

It's like a code word we have.

Oh, no. What time is it?

Are you skipping school
because of me?

I didn't want to go anyway.

All anyone ever does
is try to copy off me.

But no one wants
to sit with me at lunch.

Everybody's mean.
Middle school's stupid.

Mean girls suck.

My daughter's a mean girl.

I don't know how it happened.

It's not your fault.

But I'm her mother.

If how we turn out
is all about how our mother is,

then I'm pretty screwed, right?

Both moaning

Laughing

- What's funny?
- It's just--

she applied to colleges for you.

Wow, I'm so glad my cock
thrust up inside of you

is holding your attention
so well.

That's really nice for me.

Sorry, I just--
I don't get it.

Why don't you just dump her?

Less talking, more riding.

Both moaning

Is Mickey seriously
getting married?

Yeah. Like,
in a couple of weeks.

Jesus. To who?

I-I didn't even know
he was seeing anyone.

Well, I don't think
he was seeing her

so much as he was doing her.

- So why's he marrying her?
- She's knocked up.

So? I don't get it.

What, is your dad making him?

I don't know.

Why do you give a shit?

Indistinct chatter

Sighs

Don't you turn your back on me.

I'm a citizen of this country.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits,

which means for me,
it's stand in line

That's not only unfair

- Holy shit.
- It's flat out un-American.

- Frank?
- You know him?

Where are my equal rights?

You could say that.
He's my dad.

I-- wow, that speech.

Your father-- I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.

Oh, my God, I wish
I could turn back time.

Turn back time? Why?

Some of the office bitches
may have narc-ed on you

about the porn at your desk
and the personal phone calls.

And by office bitches,
I might mean myself.

Porn at my desk?

Oh, shit.

Fiona. Hi.

So Mr. Pratt is asking
for a word with you.

- Let me guess. He's the boss?
- No, no.

He's one of the cousins.

Not the big boss,
but he is a supervisor, yes.

Really, very sorry.

Knock at door Yes?

Hi. Fiona Gallagher.

The temp?

Oh, Fiona, yeah.

Um, go ahead and have a seat.

Go ahead, sorry.

So I've had some complaints
about your language,

a few personal calls
on company time--

- I have five kids.

They're my siblings,
but I raise them.

And one of them skipped school.

So I'm sorry
about the personal calls,

but it was really
only a couple minutes.

And I'm happy to clock out early
and work late.

Oh, no.
You don't have to do that.

There were some photos.

Yeah, the porn at my desk?

It wasn't really porn.

It was pictures of penises,

but it was
from a circumcision website.

See, friends of mine
are trying for a baby.

And I had said a thing about
how they should

circumcise the baby so that
girls will be more likely

to want to--
uh, with their mouths.

Not on the baby, of course.

I mean once he's a grown-up.

Shit.

Am I fired?

No, you're-- Clears throat
Sorry.

My silence here is not
so much about disapproval

as it is trying to find a way

to participate
in this conversation

that won't leave me vulnerable
to a lawsuit,

'cause I would like to say that
I am a little shocked

to learn that, um, circumcision,
or a lack thereof,

would affect a woman's
willingness to--

Clears throat

I can't say that.

I can't say anything, really.

I've said too much already.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't sue me.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't fire me.

Deal. But, hey,
I'm putting my foot down.

No more naked body parts
at your desk for any reason.

Both laugh
Shit. Sorry.

And watch your language,
like you're in church.

- Got it.
- And also,

you're doing a great job.

Scoffs I'm what?

I got a call from
one of our sales reps.

You apparently convinced
a high-volume customer

that we thought
we'd lost to re-up.

Something about a delivery man?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Well, anyway, great work.
And keep it up.

Do me a favor.
Don't go out there smiling.

You'll help me maintain
that reputation as a hard-ass.

You have a reputation
as a hard-ass?

No.

I really want one, though.

Laughs
Hey. Mm-mm.

_

- What's this?
- Payday.

Oh, sweet!

It's $218.

I worked 40 hours
at $10 an hour.

That's $400.

Yeah, minus taxes.

Oh, and minus the free refills

you've been giving your
little boyfriend over there.

My what? No, that's my--
I barely know him.

He's here when you're here
and he's not when you're not.

And you give him free refills.

You think I don't see?
I see.

Phillip?

Scott Walker, MIT Alumni Rep.

We had an appointment at 3:30.
It's nearly 4:00.

Right, yeah. Look,
I'm sorry you came and waited,

but I'm not interested.

You're not interested in MIT?

- No.
- Oh, that's too bad.

I was really curious
to interview the kid

with the 4.6 GPA
who so blatantly

plagiarized
his application essay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
I didn't plagiarize anything.

She plagiarized Nelson Mandela.
Jesus.

She?

Yeah, my girlfriend
wrote this application.

I'm guessing she Googled
"good speeches" and

picked one that sounded
smartest to her.

I'm surprised she didn't
go with "I have a dream."

Well, you sure you
don't want to do the interview?

- I'm already here.
- No, thanks.

- I hate Boston. Red Sox suck.
- Okay.

It's unlikely you could have
gotten in anyway.

Laughs

What is that,
reverse psychology?

Let me guess,
you minored in psych,

thinking it would give you a leg
up in business negotiations.

You may have a 4.6,
but you also required

a three semester senior year
due to truancy.

And competition is pretty
intense if you require

a full scholarship,
which I'm guessing that you do.

Wow, why don't you
just go ahead

and call me white trash
while you're at it?

Competition's tougher
at this level, that's all.

At this level. Jesus.
Give me a fucking pen.

Frank.

Frank. Frank, why?

Why would you? Why?
Sighs

My coworkers teased me so much

I had to pretend
that I was sick.

Then my mother called.

She almost had a cardiac episode
she was so upset.

I only convinced her last year
that I'm not gay.

It took me years, Frank, years.

Why would you do this?

Why, Frank, why?

The fuck are you talking about?

You told the world we're gay!

It's all over Twitter.

It's all over Facebook.

It was on the 12:00 news.

What?

You're famous
for being gay, Frank.

Are you gay?
Are you, really?

Phone ringing

I am whatever I need to be
at the time I need to be it.

Yes, mom, I'm talking to him.

No, mom, I am not-- mom.

Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

Dude, I'm telling you,
this is my car.

- It has a kid's seat in it.
- I don't give a shit.

Look at that chip
right there, man.

That diamond-shaped scratch,
I did that the night

we had too many Jaeger bombs.
Remember?

Hell, I still
got the keys, man.

Both laugh

I found my stolen car, bitch.

Well, what are you waiting
for? Call the cops.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you. Sorry.

Passing by,
couldn't help but overhear.

I'd just take it home.

Cops keep it in evidence for,
like, a year.

- You're right.
- Yeah.

He's right, man. Plus,
insurance already covered it,

so this is, like,
found money, bitch.

Why is that man
driving your car?

- Because it's stolen.
- You let him steal it?

No, Beto. I stole it,

back when life was fun
and the world had meaning.

You gonna punish me for it?

You want to break
another finger?

How about a toe?

Maybe cut off
a couple earlobes?

Stick a fork in my eye?

Cheers and applause

Saw you on the news, Frank.

- About time you came out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Have your fun.
Just pour me a goddamn drink.

Don't do it, Kate.
We don't need

- his AIDS germs in here.
- Screw you, Tommy.

- You wish.
- Are you really gay now, Frank?

What is gay, Kermit?
Gay is a state of mind.

It is a mood.

Gay is when you part
the ass cheeks of another man

and use your dick
as a divining rod.

Well, by that definition, no,
then I'm not gay.

Then what are you doing
going on the news,

talking about gay rights?

I was trying to get
insurance coverage.

Hey, Frank, how do you fit
three homos on a barstool?

You turn it upside down!

Laughter

Kate, I leave it to you
to rise above

this homophobic rhetoric

and offer me recompense
in the form of whiskey.

It's only homophobia
when they're afraid of you.

I'm pretty sure
they just don't like you.

Come on, just give me
a drink anyway--

- You maxed out your tab, Frank.
- Hey.

What does one gay say to another
one going on vacation?

"Can I help you
pack your shit?"

Laughter

Kermit, that joke is so
hackneyed, you owe me a drink.

What's the difference between
a refrigerator and a fag?

The fridge doesn't fart
when you pull the meat out!

Laughter

All: Oh, no.

Clears throat

Your insipid essay question
asks me to tell you

in 250 words about my most
significant challenge in life.

Honestly,
it's hard to pick one.

My guess is that
you want to hear about

my alcoholic father and
my runaway mom or maybe about--

You would eat that shit up.

But those aren't
my greatest challenges in life.

An education system that
pretends to be a meritocracy--

What would you want to study
at MIT?

Provided you could get past
my well-meaning oblivion

and the proximity
of the Red Sox.

Robotics.

But none of that undergrad
filler bullshit.

No 200-seat lectures
taught by TAS.

I just want the shit
out in front of me.

The shit?

Yeah, the tools, you know,
the toys,

the stuff I can't get access
to in my ghetto high school.

Why?

Because I'd like to hang out
with C-3PO in my lifetime.

And at the rate you're going,
that shit's not gonna happen.

I'm not following.

You don't want
to go to classes,

you just want to play in a lab?

I don't want to sit in
a lecture that teaches me

how to modify algorithms
instead of think for myself.

And?

Okay, the people working
the weaving machines

in the 17th century, you know,

they didn't see
the steam engine coming.

One invention.
Industrial revolution.

I mean, Encyclopedia Britannica
didn't see Wikipedia coming.

Great things don't happen
in tiny little increments.

You know, they happen when

someone thinks completely
differently.

And all you geniuses,
you just--

you're just
modifying algorithms.

C-3PO, huh?

That dude's a badass.

You know, he's fluent in over

6 million
forms of communication.

Give me the money.

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

Give me your money.

Is that a toy gun?

Shot fires

Aah! Fuck!

Rock music

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Aah!

Horn honks Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Aah!

Get in. We drink.

Fuck-- oh, God damn it!

Speaking portuguese _

Hey, faggot.

I am not a faggot.

And I could sue you
for the use of the word.

Whoa, Nellie.
I'm on your side.

Come on in.
Let us buy you a drink.

Come on.
I'm not gonna bite--

unless you ask me to.

 Bottoms up

 bottoms up bottoms up

 bottoms up don't stop

- What's with him?
- No idea.

He's been weird all day.

You, um-- you plagiarized
Nelson Mandela.

Who?

The MIT application essay.

Oh, you think I should have
wrote it myself?

No. I think
you shouldn't have

applied to colleges for me
without asking me.

I did ask you.

I asked you, like, 100 times
to get the applications in,

- and you ignored me.
- For a reason.

What reason,
that you're an idiot?

That you want
to waste your life laying around

in this shit-hole neighborhood
forever?

You have any idea
how much stuff

I had to steal and sell
to pay those application fees?

It was a huge pain in the ass,
and I did it for you.

So you could be a little bit
nicer about it.

You know, you might even
want to say thank you.

Thank you.

Both moaning

Thank you. Thank you!

Both grunting

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

May I transfer you to sales?

Thank you so much.

And you have a Worldwide day.

Hey, Fiona. You okay?

Huh? Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Mike's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

Maria got an infection
in the hospital.

She's gonna be out for at least
a couple more weeks.

I-I was thinking of requesting
you, if you're available.

Easier than training
a new girl every day.

That'd be great.

Only thing is,
Mr. Pratt, Sr.

Uncle Matt, we call him,
he's kind of conservative.

He's a deacon at First Baptist.

I'm sure that outfit
would have been great

at your last office, but--

Shit, really? Gasps Shit.

Oh, fuck-- mm. Sorry.

It's okay.
Just button up a little bit

and it'll all be all right.

Rock music

Please tell your father
I'm a big fan.



- It's truth, you see?
- What's truth?

That you are no good for Fiona.

What the hell do you know?

I know you
are not meant for this life.

You are a rich boy,
born with a silver spoon, eh?

It's okay not to be ashamed.

I am from the favela.
Okay?

And now I have silver spoon.
You can go that way.

But the other way?
Scoffs

That way is just misery.

Bitter. Resent. Miseria.

It's better you should go now,
before Fiona and

the kids get more, uh,
what's the--

- Attached.
- Attached, yes.

Or before you and Fiona
make a baby together.

'Cause after a baby,

then it's misery, bitter,
resent forever.

Men, we need space to think.

So walk, think.

This time,
I will not follow you.

Thanks, man.

Hey, but if you break any laws,

I will chop off
both your hands, eh?

I got it.

You use that Mandela speech
in all the applications?

No, mixed it up a little bit.

Couple of dead presidents
and some guy called "Gandy."

Gandhi?

I don't get why
you'd want me to go to MIT.

You know,
Boston's pretty far away.

I thought maybe you'd take me
with you, but--

But what?

No one's ever been
as good to me as you have.

You're better than this
neighborhood.

You're better
than anyone I've ever met.

And you deserve to get out--

even if you
don't take me with you,

which I never really
thought you would anyway.

So is it true?

You're getting married?

So who is it?
Is it Angie Zahgo

or some other piece of trash
you screw so you can pretend

I don't matter to you?

Hey, what the fuck, Gallagher?
Glass shatters

Oh, he speaks!

So that's it. We're over.

Your dad beats the shit
out of us,

and you're just gonna
get married, no conversation?

Nothing?

Get the fuck off me.

Oh, you want to fag bash?

That make you feel like a man?

Come on. Go ahead!
Do it!

Grunts

Fuck.

Gasping

You love me, and you're gay.

Just admit it, just this once.

Just fucking admit it.
Grunts

Coughs

You feel better now?

You feel like a man?

Groans

Grunts

I feel better now.

Oh, just the man
I was hoping to run into.

I can't see you anymore.

I'm with Mandy now.

Sorry, I, uh...

I shouldn't have started up
with you again.

You're not serious.

She's good for me,
and you're not.

And, uh...

yeah, that's all.

What about boys?

What about them?

- Well, do you like any?
- None that like me.

I'm not pretty like Fiona.

My teeth are messed up,
and my chest is flat.

You know, they have
special bras for that.

Door slams shut

- Hey.
- Hey, Karen.

Um, is there anything to eat?

Mom?

Jesus. What-fucking-ever!

Clatter Hey!

Stomping upstairs

What did she do that's so bad
that you won't talk to her?

She wrote the Wongs and
told them to take Hymie away.

She told them I was crazy and

that I had Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder

and that
I was bad for the baby.

I do have
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,

but I-I've been working
really hard to treat it.

And my meds have been
really working.

And I am a little crazy,

but I'm not bad for that baby.

That part's just not true.

Sheila?

Yeah, honey?

I've seen crazy,
and I've seen bad for kids.

You aren't
either of those things.

You're super nice.

I've made a lot of mistakes.

Then say you're sorry.

Because if Monica came back,
said she was sorry,

and stayed...
I'd forgive her.

I would forgive her
for everything,

because she's my mom.

I'm so...

sorry your mom left you.

But you-- you know
it's not your fault, right?

Do you know that?
It's not your fault.

Crying

Lighter sparks

Cell phone ringing

- Who's this?
- Hey, Mandy.

It's Karen Jackson.
I just wanted to call

and say thank you for
applying to colleges for Lip.

- What?
- My mom kind of sucks

these days, so it'll be awesome
to have somewhere new to go.

And all I have to do
is poke one hole in a condom,

and he'll do
whatever I say forever.

I mean, we learned that
from last time.

Fuck you.

Oh, you mean, like,
all three of us?

Yeah, I could be down for that.

Do you want me to ask Lip
next time we do it?

 Aren't you the one
who tried to hurt me

 when you said good-bye?

 Did you think I'd crumble?

 Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

 Oh, no, not I

 I will survive  Oh, yeah.

All:  Oh, as long
as I know how to love

 I know I'll stay alive

 I've got
all my life to live

 I've got
all my love to give

 I will survive
I will survive

Cheers and applause

Yeah!

Yeah!

Jesus. Oh. Whoa.

What's an Adam's apple matter

if you can blow like that?

Laid-back music



Hey. Hi.
You want a blowjob?

I'll give you
a blowjob for $10--

or a rock.
Do you have a rock?

I give really good blowjobs.

Siren blaring

Are you sure you don't want one?

Do you know how many
nerve endings

are in the foreskin of a penis?

I don't think there's
a single guy who wishes

he had more nerves down there.

Well, what if our son
wants to be a transsexual?

They will need that skin
to make him a proper vagina.

Why is that even a question?

The gays brought
the gift baskets, Kevin.

Look at all the gift baskets.

I'm saying, it's a possibility.

What's all this?

Frank told the world he's gay.

And the gay world responded
with chocolate and cheese.

- And good wine.
- Wow.

Debs, school,
why didn't you go?

Sheila was depressed,
like, bad depressed.

- Monica depressed.
- Code pink.

I'm sorry
you had to deal with that.

- Is Frank really gay?
- No. Laughs

Carl, it's a scam.
It's always some kind of scam.

This scam tastes awesome.

Is this dinner?

- Where's Jimmy?
- I don't know.

Think he's still wondering
if there's any more cheese?

- Laughs
- Try the moldy one.

- I like the one with the holes.
- Hey, put that down.

- Wipe your mouth afterwards.
- Laughs

What did Kevin say?

Laughter

Indistinct chatter downstairs

Knock at door

Come in.

Hi. Honey, hi.

Mom, I am not
in the mood right now.

I'm sorry I was so crazy
when you were little.

I-I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to get my meds balanced.

And I'm sorry
that I missed so many

of your school events because
I couldn't leave the house.

And I--

I'm sorry that I-I took up
with your husband,

even if you didn't want him.

It's just a-- well, just
a terrible thing

for a mother to do.

There-- there are so many ways
I wish I--

I could have been
a better mother to you.

I-I hope you can forgive me,
Karen.

I hope we can start over,
because I--

Sobs

I love you so very much.

I love you so much.

I--
Text alert

_

Okay, I'm sorry, mom.
It's-- it's Lip.

He wants to meet at the park.

Oh.

Oh. Are you--
are you seeing Lip again?

I hope so.

Okay.

Giggles

Horn honks

Fuck you too.
Stupid bitch.

Knock at door

Christopher!

Christopher!

Go away, Frank.
You're drunk.

You need a meeting.
Go away.

Christopher, why?

It was so good between us.

I'm sorry, Frank.

Mom says
this is how it has to be.

No, Chris, wait. Wait, Chris! Ohh!

Dogs barking

Rock music



So you like emergency
medicine, right?

Hours suck.
But, yeah, I love it.

And it's a shorter track
than surgery, right?

- Barely.
- Incoming ambulance.

Serious head trauma,
two minutes out.

All right.

- How's the money?
- The money's good.

And the saving people's lives
is pretty great, too.

You mean, like,
the adrenaline rush?

What's going on, man?

You thinking about
going back to school?

You know, thought I hated
med school, but U of M's

looking pretty damn great
right now.

Oh, hey. Bright.
Chuckles

Mr. Gallagher,
when you're ready to rise,

we'd like to buy you a meal
and have a chat.

What'd you hit?

Girl at school.

Don't forget to check for hair
behind the grill.

Call Manny
about the windshield.

We've looked into
your records, Frank.

You're an alcoholic,
a derelict.

Not the kind of man
we usually want on our side.

But you, my friend, have
stumbled ass over Teakettle

into the most
significant moment

in the history
of the gay rights movement.

We both know that
we're not second-class citizens,

but there are a lot of people
in this country

who still need convincing.

And you are the missing piece
in our puzzle.

You blue-collar, working-class,
Irish-Catholic.

You have the ears of the people

whose minds most need changing.

You also have dog shit on
your face and no place to live,

but we can fix that
if you agree to work with us.

You've got my attention, Mr.--

Paige. Abraham Paige.

We'll clean you up.
We'll house you.

We'll coach you.

Do you remember
"Joe The Plumber"?

Heard of him?
He's a personal hero of mine.

Well, you are gay Joe.

- Frank the plumber?
- No.

Frank, the father.

Frank, the son.
Frank, the neighbor.

Frank, the face
of the gay-rights movement.

Oh, jeez.

- Oh.
- Take it.

- Ow.
- Take it. This shit. Yeah.

- Ow.
- Take it, you little gimp.

Turn over.
Mama's gonna give you an exam.

Groans

- Take it.
- Ow.

- Take it.
- Ow.

Don't you shit on my hand.
You hear me?

- Yeah. Ooh. Take it.
- Ow.

Yeah.

Ah!

Both moaning





I-I don't really know what
happened on Shameless last week.

Call once you find out.

I'm home now.

Mandy, I know
you're seeing Lip.

But like I told him,
I think it's great.

You knew Karen
was in town, didn't you?

If you've got a problem with me
being here, just say so.

I have a problem
with you being here.

- What do you want?
- Take your clothes off.

Plumber's apprentice.
I can do that.

- Do you have experience?
- I fixed our toilet.

You shook the handle.
Well, here's a good one.

Barista at the coffee beanery.

Jimmy.
Andy from med school.

You remember Adam Britt,
Nick Stathis, Mark.

We're grabbing dinner
tomorrow night.

You should join us.

She's gonna fuck the faggot
out of you, kid.

And you're goddamn gonna watch.

- Karen?
- Gasps

You told me you came home
to be with Hymie.

But you told the Wongs
to come take Hymie.

Dead bolts, front and back.

Frank's not allowed in anymore.

Frank, I'm Chris.

Would you be my sponsor?

My previous sponsor moved out.

- What, he lived with you?
- Yeah.

I'm sorry. Let me introduce
myself properly.

Frank Gallagher.

Night, Frank.

Good night, Christopher.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Rock music



What do you think?

Great for a coke orgy,
not for an office job.

- This is my nicest dress.
- No, I know.

I didn't say
that it wasn't nice.

I just said you can't wear it
to an office.

You said "coke orgy."

- You okay?
- Uh, yeah, just tired.

- Didn't sleep well.
- Take a nap later.

Naps are for kids
and college students.

I gotta go to work.

- You sure I can't--
- 100% sure.

Baby squeals

Hey, you got an extra
one of those?

- You're gonna be late!
- Got nothing to wear.

Gonna see what V has.

Is your new job
at a strip club?

- Ha, ha.
- I wasn't kidding.

It's a temp office job,
so I don't know

how long the day's gonna be.

I expect all of you
to help Jimmy with dinner

and get your homework done
and generally avoid

setting the house on fire.

Overcompensating.

She feels guilty for
turning us into latchkey kids.

What's a latchkey kid?

Hey.

I left some stuff here
that I need.

Is it wrong if I just
leave for school?

Later.

Baby babbles

- All right.
- Squeals

Grunts

Upbeat music

Laughs



Both laughing

Laughing

- What's funny?
- Garfield.

He's always so hungry.

Laughs

What are you reading about?

A bunch of uppity queers
claiming that

domestic partnership rights
are not good enough for them.

They get offended when
you call them queers, Frank.

Calling people
by their name is not,

nor should it ever,
be argued as offensive.

God almighty.

- You okay?
- No!

I'm a pauper, and somehow
I got the king's disease.

Gonorrhea?

Kings don't screw whores.

They screw virgins
or their nieces.

The king's disease is gout.

Big toe is throbbing
like blue balls

that no blowjob can ever fix.

You got any Percs or Vikes?

No, but I could call my doctor,

see if she can fit you in.

She's super nice.
Korean. Small fingers.

No, thank you.
Doctors are crooks,

especially the Korean ones.

Never trust a culture
that makes sausages from dogs.

Frank, I'm pretty sure
that's racist.

Accurate is not racist.

Write that down
in your AA journal.

Hold on.
You work for the city.

- Yeah.
- We live together.

You cook for me,
clean for me, shop for me.

That makes us family.

Oh, Frank, I'm touched.

We qualify for domestic
partnership rights.

I can use your insurance,
go to the lady doctor

with the small fingers
for free.

No. No, no.

Those laws do not apply to us.

Why not?

Why should our heterosexual
proclivities

prevent us
from collecting our due?

That is heterophobia,
and I won't stand for it.

You won't?

The squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

Write that down, Christopher.

You mean everything you said?

No.

Well, how much of it
did you mean?

I don't know-- I mean,
I meant a little bit of it.

You know, I think
there's some things that

we could stand to talk about,
but mostly, I just--

Was in douche land?

Not my choice of words, but--

Why does Karen Jackson
still have pictures of you

on her Facebook page?

I have no fucking idea.

Well, if there's nothing going
on between the two of you--

- Mandy, I don't go
on to Facebook, okay?

'Cause I don't give a shit
about whose pet just died

or who just checked in
at the fucking McDonald's.

She's a skanky,
manipulative bitch.

You should un-friend her.

Also, you have an appointment
this afternoon

with the alumni rep from MIT.

It's 3:30 here.

- What?
- It's a good thing.

It means you got past
the first round.

Yeah. No, no, no.
I know that.

But, um, I never applied
for MIT.

Yeah, you did.
Also Carnegie Mellon,

Northwestern, Columbia,
Stanford, and Penn.

Come on, I can't be late today.

Whoa, wait. Hang on.

You applied
to all those schools for me?

A few fallbacks, too,
just in case.

No, no. Wait.

This is perfect.
Where did you get this?

I used to do the sexy
librarian thing--

glasses, hair bun,
the whole bit.

But you need hose.
Those offices pump in the AC.

Oh, nah. I'm warm-blooded.
I'll be good.

Kev, do guys get PMS?

Are you asking me if I bleed
from my nuts once a month?

I'm asking if guys get their
own version of--

I don't know,
hormonal bullshit.

- Nope.
- Yes, he does.

- Do not.
- Remember when you broke

the TV remote last month
for no good reason?

It wouldn't fucking work.
That's a good reason.

We get weepy.
They get angry.

Jimmy doesn't
seem angry exactly.

- He seems quiet.
- Oh, God. Stop.

Would you stop right there?

We get quiet for one minute,
and you guys

think that we're obsessing
about the relationship.

And all we're thinking is,
"I wonder if

there's any more cheese."

You mean we make you smarter
than you are?

No, no, no.

You make us more interested
in you than we are.

Oh, don't mind him.

He's just mad 'cause somebody
cut off the tip of his penis

when he was too young
to defend himself.

V, don't start that shit!

What are we talking about?

Whether or not
to circumcise our baby.

- Are you-- wait. Is your mom--
- No, no one's pregnant.

And if somebody were pregnant,

it still may not even be a boy.

- But if it is a boy--
- If it is a boy,

you gotta circumcise.

I mean, have you ever
seen one that's uncut?

You don't know
what's going on up in there.

It does not make you
want to go downtown.

And you want your kid
to get his share of head, right?

Thank you!

Or not? Crap. Sorry.

Thanks for the suit.
Gotta go.

Bye. Love you. Okay.

Door shuts

Knock at door

- Morning.
- Morning, Jody.

Fiona said you guys
were gonna watch Liam today?

Uh, I gotta work.

But it'll be good
for Sheila to watch him.

Sheila, Debbie's here.

I gotta go, babe. Sit up.

Sitting up's a real good start.

I, uh-- I gotta go.

Sheila, are you okay?

I'm fine.

Of course, I'm-- I'm fine.

Fiona said you were gonna
watch Liam today.

Yes, that's fine.

It'll be nice to have a baby.

Good morning, mom.

Sighs

- Hi, Karen.
- Hey.

Have you had any breakfast?

Sobbing

- Snaps fingers
- Yo, chief.

I asked for
a bone-dry cappuccino.

This isn't bone-dry.

Oh, so you're talking about,
like,

the kind of bone that's been
left out in the sun?

'Cause living bones
are 35% water,

and they bleed
when you break them.

Are you freaking kidding me?

No, not you, man. Sorry.

Coffee shop boy
is giving me lip. Hang on.

Dude, when I spend as much
for a cup of coffee

as a gallon of gas,
I get it how I want it.

Remake it bone-dry, dirt-dry,
fucking desert-dry, okay?

- Do it now!
- Very sorry, sir.

We'll take care of that
right away.

Just do it.

I don't understand.
You really don't get

- why I have a problem with this?
- No.

- Really?
- No!

Ian, do you get
why I have a problem with this?

Not getting in the middle.

Why are you being
such a dick about this?

Those applications
are 90 pages long.

It took me forever
to fill them out.

Walk the fuck away.

- Wow. You're--
- What? I'm what?

You're not my mother.

You're not in charge
of who I talk to

or who has a picture of me
on Facebook.

And you're sure as shit
not in charge

of if I go to college!

You think he's right?

Men are never right.

That's why women were invented,

to think for you assholes.

I mean, look at Mickey, marrying
some whore he knocked up.

What?

Men are weak and stupid,
even the good ones.

I mean, especially
the good ones.

And I'm not gonna
watch Lip fuck up his life

the way that Mickey's
fucking up his.

School bell chimes

Hey, Sheila, I made you some
cinnamon toast and coffee.

Cinnamon toast and coffee
always makes me

feel a little better
when I'm down.

It's just, you have to sit up
to eat it.

- Sobs
- Come on, Sheila.

Sit up.
You'll feel better, I promise.

Sobs

You the temp?

Yeah, hi. Yes.
Fiona Gallagher.

Nice to meet you, Fiona.
I'm Connie.

We're all
on a first-name basis here.

It's a family-run company,
real friendly place.

- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Follow me.

You'll be covering for Maria.

She's a cold caller
in our marketing department.

And last week, Friday,
she was having cramps,

but it wasn't
her time of the month.

And I told her not to ignore it,
but did she listen?

Appendicitis. She barely
made it there in time.

Honest, it was about to burst.
And then who knows?

- Wow, that's--
- Yeah, so, if you're

having cramps
on your left side,

and it's not
your time of the month,

you shouldn't ignore it,
or you could very well die.

- That's good to know.
- Isn't it?

You can drop your bag there,
and I'll show you around.

- Okay.
- That's the copy room,

the warehouse, the kitchen,
treadmill, water cooler.

That's the fridge.
Anything with a label on it

belongs to somebody else,
except for the yogurts.

Margie never labels them
because everyone

just knows she's always
on a diet.

So if you know
what's good for you--

Stay away from the yogurt.
Got it.

But the donuts on the table
are fair game.

Fair game as in free?

We all take turns buying a box.

But you're a temp,
so you can just have one.

That's the bathroom,
women's room.

Once you get settled in,

you'll be making calls
from this list.

And you'll read
from this script.

It's real simple.
You'll start here.

And if they say this,
you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

You get the idea?

You're calling customers
who haven't

placed an order for a while.

So if you get a bite,
you transfer them

straight away to sales
by pressing this button.

They'll close the deal.

So, uh, I'm the fluffer
and they're the happy ending?

I'm sorry, uh--

I have a lot of brothers.

All right.

I'll be over there,
if you have any questions.

Sighs

What do you mean,
living together for a year?

What kind of a rule is that?

We call that rule a law.

Well, it just so happens,
I was mistaken.

Christopher and I have been
living together

for a year, well over a year.

Sir, if you just
let me explain--

And just because my name
isn't on the utility bill,

that is no reason to deny me
my basic civil rights.

Sir, I'm just trying
to explain to you what we have--

My partner has been
working hard killing dogs

for this city
for close to a decade.

- You kill dogs?
- Animal control.

I know my rights.

Sir, I cannot award you
domestic partnership status

unless you have proof
that you are and have been

financially and emotionally
interdependent partners

for over a year.

Joint tenancy documents
verifying--

- I know my rights.

Do you not understand
that I get 150 of you people

in here a day spouting
this same shit at me?

"You people"? What can
that mean, "you people"?

- Oh, no, we're not like that.
- You're not like what?

We are not the kind of people
you can push around

with your homophobic rhetoric.

Where are you going?
I'm still talking!

I'm going on break.

That's my civil right!

Fucking-- let's go.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

We've noticed that you haven't
renewed your order in a while.

And I was wondering
if I could transfer you

to our sales dep--

Oh, no? Huh.

Well, that's really shitty.

Yeah, no, I get it.

I had a mailman at home
like that, a real seedy dude.

It looked like he was
casing the joint

every time he dropped off
a package.

I got so fed up,
that I called the post office

and, you know, I had them
take him off my route.

Now we have this great lady,
Josephine, really nice.

I bet if you call and complain,
they'll switch him out for you.

But either way,
they'll want to hear about it.

Great. Yes,
I will transfer you now.

Good luck.

Clears throat

Hey. They had a rude
delivery guy, so I--

I heard. It's just--
if they say this, you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

- You stick to the script.
- I got it.

Sorry. It won't happen again.

Okay.

Cell phone ringing

Hello?

What?

Oh, yes, Debbie is home sick
from school today.

Thank you.

Sighs

Are you ready?

Yeah, I'm just not into
this setup.

- I look weak.
- It's gimp porn, babe.

You're supposed to look weak.

Am I also supposed to look fat?

Jeez, you sound like a woman.

Maybe it's because someone
cut off part of your manhood

when you were too young
to defend yourself.

I just don't want to do
the gimp thing.

Do you know how expensive
a kid is, Kev?

Sack it up.

Phone ringing

Hey, Fi.

Hey, can you pop over
to the house

and see if Debbie's there?

I don't know
if she's really sick

or if she's skipping or what.

All right,
I'll go check on her.

But you have to go
to www.dontcutitoff.org

- What?
- I'm serious, Fiona.

Go to that website
and see if you stand by your

"I want my son to get
his share of head" argument.

Do not do it, Fiona.

dontcutitoff.org, promise.
Promise!

- Okay. Okay, okay. I'll do it.
- All right, bye.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

Vote Paul Lashmet
for a better Chicago.

Hope I can count on your vote.

Nice to meet you.

Baby cries

Can't you shut the baby up?

I could shove her up your ass
and see if that does it.

You need to learn respect
for your elders.

You need to learn
to not be a total dickwad.

I have a plan to put Chicago
back to work.

Hey. Hey. Over here.

I know you can hear me,
Mr. Give-Me-Your-Vote!

You want to know
what's wrong with this city?

You want
to know what doesn't work?

My wife and I got married
after three weeks of dating,

and she turned out to be
a bipolar drug addict-- easy--

who left me alone
with six kids to raise,

while my domestic partner,

Mr. Christopher Collier,
is a clean and sober,

hardworking citizen
of this country.

I think he deserves
the same rights

as a woman who would
abandon her children.

Thank you, sir. And I will
consider your situation.

Don't you turn your back on me.

- Oh, don't you worry.
- I'm a citizen of this country.

I live in this city.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits.

Which means for me,
it's stand in the line

at the free clinic or suffer.

That's not only unfair
and unchristian,

it's flat out un-American.

I'm a citizen.

Where are my equal rights?

Fix that,
Mr. I-Want-To-Be-Mayor.

Fuck.

Thank you so much.

I'll transfer you now.

Cell phone chimes

Sighs _

I like this color.

Kind of cheers you up
just looking at it, right?

It does.

Sometimes when
you're feeling really bad,

if you make yourself
look better on the outside,

it can start to make you
feel better on the inside.

My mom calls it,
"taking it from the outside in."

Phone ringing

Jackson residence.

Debbie, you were just supposed
to drop Liam there.

Why aren't you at school?
Are you sick?

Uh, code pink.

- Monica's home?
- No, no, no.

Code pink at Sheila's.

- I'll explain later, okay?
- Fine, explain later.

But you're in big trouble.

Sighs

What's a code pink?

It's nothing.

I was just trying
to explain to Fiona

why I'm not at school.

It's like a code word we have.

Oh, no. What time is it?

Are you skipping school
because of me?

I didn't want to go anyway.

All anyone ever does
is try to copy off me.

But no one wants
to sit with me at lunch.

Everybody's mean.
Middle school's stupid.

Mean girls suck.

My daughter's a mean girl.

I don't know how it happened.

It's not your fault.

But I'm her mother.

If how we turn out
is all about how our mother is,

then I'm pretty screwed, right?

Both moaning

Laughing

- What's funny?
- It's just--

she applied to colleges for you.

Wow, I'm so glad my cock
thrust up inside of you

is holding your attention
so well.

That's really nice for me.

Sorry, I just--
I don't get it.

Why don't you just dump her?

Less talking, more riding.

Both moaning

Is Mickey seriously
getting married?

Yeah. Like,
in a couple of weeks.

Jesus. To who?

I-I didn't even know
he was seeing anyone.

Well, I don't think
he was seeing her

so much as he was doing her.

- So why's he marrying her?
- She's knocked up.

So? I don't get it.

What, is your dad making him?

I don't know.

Why do you give a shit?

Indistinct chatter

Sighs

Don't you turn your back on me.

I'm a citizen of this country.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits,

which means for me,
it's stand in line

That's not only unfair
and unchristian...

- Holy shit.
- It's flat out un-American.

- Frank?
- You know him?

Where are my equal rights?

You could say that.
He's my dad.

I-- wow, that speech.

Your father-- I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.

Oh, my God, I wish
I could turn back time.

Turn back time? Why?

Some of the office bitches
may have narc-ed on you

about the porn at your desk
and the personal phone calls.

And by office bitches,
I might mean myself.

Porn at my desk?

Oh, shit.

Fiona. Hi.

So Mr. Pratt is asking
for a word with you.

- Let me guess. He's the boss?
- No, no.

He's one of the cousins.

Not the big boss,
but he is a supervisor, yes.

Really, very sorry.

Knock at door Yes?

Hi. Fiona Gallagher.

The temp?

Oh, Fiona, yeah.

Um, go ahead and have a seat.

Go ahead, sorry.

So I've had some complaints
about your language,

a few personal calls
on company time--

- I have five kids.

They're my siblings,
but I raise them.

And one of them skipped school.

So I'm sorry
about the personal calls,

but it was really
only a couple minutes.

And I'm happy to clock out early
and work late.

Oh, no.
You don't have to do that.

There were some photos.

Yeah, the porn at my desk?

It wasn't really porn.

It was pictures of penises,

but it was
from a circumcision website.

See, friends of mine
are trying for a baby.

And I had said a thing about
how they should

circumcise the baby so that
girls will be more likely

to want to--
uh, with their mouths.

Not on the baby, of course.

I mean once he's a grown-up.

Shit.

Am I fired?

No, you're-- Clears throat
Sorry.

My silence here is not
so much about disapproval

as it is trying to find a way

to participate
in this conversation

that won't leave me vulnerable
to a lawsuit,

'cause I would like to say that
I am a little shocked

to learn that, um, circumcision,
or a lack thereof,

would affect a woman's
willingness to--

Clears throat

I can't say that.

I can't say anything, really.

I've said too much already.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't sue me.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't fire me.

Deal. But, hey,
I'm putting my foot down.

No more naked body parts
at your desk for any reason.

Both laugh
Shit. Sorry.

And watch your language,
like you're in church.

- Got it.
- And also,

you're doing a great job.

Scoffs I'm what?

I got a call from
one of our sales reps.

You apparently convinced
a high-volume customer

that we thought
we'd lost to re-up.

Something about a delivery man?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Well, anyway, great work.
And keep it up.

Do me a favor.
Don't go out there smiling.

You'll help me maintain
that reputation as a hard-ass.

You have a reputation
as a hard-ass?

No.

I really want one, though.

Laughs
Hey. Mm-mm.

_

- What's this?
- Payday.

Oh, sweet!

It's $218.

I worked 40 hours
at $10 an hour.

That's $400.

Yeah, minus taxes.

Oh, and minus the free refills

you've been giving your
little boyfriend over there.

My what? No, that's my--
I barely know him.

He's here when you're here
and he's not when you're not.

And you give him free refills.

You think I don't see?
I see.

Phillip?

Scott Walker, MIT Alumni Rep.

We had an appointment at 3:30.
It's nearly 4:00.

Right, yeah. Look,
I'm sorry you came and waited,

but I'm not interested.

You're not interested in MIT?

- No.
- Oh, that's too bad.

I was really curious
to interview the kid

with the 4.6 GPA
who so blatantly

plagiarized
his application essay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
I didn't plagiarize anything.

She plagiarized Nelson Mandela.
Jesus.

She?

Yeah, my girlfriend
wrote this application.

I'm guessing she Googled
"good speeches" and

picked one that sounded
smartest to her.

I'm surprised she didn't
go with "I have a dream."

Well, you sure you
don't want to do the interview?

- I'm already here.
- No, thanks.

- I hate Boston. Red Sox suck.
- Okay.

It's unlikely you could have
gotten in anyway.

Laughs

What is that,
reverse psychology?

Let me guess,
you minored in psych,

thinking it would give you a leg
up in business negotiations.

You may have a 4.6,
but you also required

a three semester senior year
due to truancy.

And competition is pretty
intense if you require

a full scholarship,
which I'm guessing that you do.

Wow, why don't you
just go ahead

and call me white trash
while you're at it?

Competition's tougher
at this level, that's all.

At this level. Jesus.
Give me a fucking pen.

Frank.

Frank. Frank, why?

Why would you? Why?
Sighs

My coworkers teased me so much

I had to pretend
that I was sick.

Then my mother called.

She almost had a cardiac episode
she was so upset.

I only convinced her last year
that I'm not gay.

It took me years, Frank, years.

Why would you do this?

Why, Frank, why?

The fuck are you talking about?

You told the world we're gay!

It's all over Twitter.

It's all over Facebook.

It was on the 12:00 news.

What?

You're famous
for being gay, Frank.

Are you gay?
Are you, really?

Phone ringing

I am whatever I need to be
at the time I need to be it.

Christ, write that down.

Yes, mom, I'm talking to him.

No, mom, I am not-- mom.

Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

Dude, I'm telling you,
this is my car.

- It has a kid's seat in it.
- I don't give a shit.

Look at that chip
right there, man.

That diamond-shaped scratch,
I did that the night

we had too many Jaeger bombs.
Remember?

Hell, I still
got the keys, man.

Both laugh

I found my stolen car, bitch.

Well, what are you waiting
for? Call the cops.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you. Sorry.

Passing by,
couldn't help but overhear.

I'd just take it home.

Cops keep it in evidence for,
like, a year.

- You're right.
- Yeah.

He's right, man. Plus,
insurance already covered it,

so this is, like,
found money, bitch.

Why is that man
driving your car?

- Because it's stolen.
- You let him steal it?

No, Beto. I stole it,

back when life was fun
and the world had meaning.

You gonna punish me for it?

You want to break
another finger?

How about a toe?

Maybe cut off
a couple earlobes?

Stick a fork in my eye?

Cheers and applause

Saw you on the news, Frank.

- About time you came out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Have your fun.
Just pour me a goddamn drink.

Don't do it, Kate.
We don't need

- his AIDS germs in here.
- Screw you, Tommy.

- You wish.
- Are you really gay now, Frank?

What is gay, Kermit?
Gay is a state of mind.

It is a mood.

Gay is when you part
the ass cheeks of another man

and use your dick
as a divining rod.

Well, by that definition, no,
then I'm not gay.

Then what are you doing
going on the news,

talking about gay rights?

I was trying to get
insurance coverage.

Hey, Frank, how do you fit
three homos on a barstool?

You turn it upside down!

Laughter

Kate, I leave it to you
to rise above

this homophobic rhetoric

and offer me recompense
in the form of whiskey.

It's only homophobia
when they're afraid of you.

I'm pretty sure
they just don't like you.

Come on, just give me
a drink anyway--

- You maxed out your tab, Frank.
- Hey.

What does one gay say to another
one going on vacation?

"Can I help you
pack your shit?"

Laughter

Kermit, that joke is so
hackneyed, you owe me a drink.

What's the difference between
a refrigerator and a fag?

The fridge doesn't fart
when you pull the meat out!

Laughter

All: Oh, no.

Clears throat

Your insipid essay question
asks me to tell you

in 250 words about my most
significant challenge in life.

Honestly,
it's hard to pick one.

My guess is that
you want to hear about

my alcoholic father and
my runaway mom or maybe about--

You would eat that shit up.

But those aren't
my greatest challenges in life.

An education system that
pretends to be a meritocracy--

What would you want to study
at MIT?

Provided you could get past
my well-meaning oblivion

and the proximity
of the Red Sox.

Robotics.

But none of that undergrad
filler bullshit.

No 200-seat lectures
taught by TAS.

I just want the shit
out in front of me.

The shit?

Yeah, the tools, you know,
the toys,

the stuff I can't get access
to in my ghetto high school.

Why?

Because I'd like to hang out
with C-3PO in my lifetime.

And at the rate you're going,
that shit's not gonna happen.

I'm not following.

You don't want
to go to classes,

you just want to play in a lab?

I don't want to sit in
a lecture that teaches me

how to modify algorithms
instead of think for myself.

And?

Okay, the people working
the weaving machines

in the 17th century, you know,

they didn't see
the steam engine coming.

One invention.
Industrial revolution.

I mean, Encyclopedia Britannica
didn't see Wikipedia coming.

Great things don't happen
in tiny little increments.

You know, they happen when

someone thinks completely
differently.

And all you geniuses,
you just--

you're just
modifying algorithms.

C-3PO, huh?

That dude's a badass.

You know, he's fluent in over

6 million
forms of communication.

Give me the money.

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

He's been weird all day.

You, um-- you plagiarized
Nelson Mandela.

Who?

The MIT application essay.

Oh, you think I should have
wrote it myself?

No. I think
you shouldn't have

applied to colleges for me
without asking me.

I did ask you.

I asked you, like, 100 times
to get the applications in,

- and you ignored me.
- For a reason.

What reason,
that you're an idiot?

That you want
to waste your life laying around

in this shit-hole neighborhood
forever?

You have any idea
how much stuff

I had to steal and sell
to pay those application fees?

It was a huge pain in the ass,
and I did it for you.

So you could be a little bit
nicer about it.

You know, you might even
want to say thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you!

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

May I transfer you to sales?

Thank you so much.

Hey, Fiona. You okay?

Huh? Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Mike's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

Maria got an infection
in the hospital.

She's gonna be out for at least
a couple more weeks.

I-I was thinking of requesting
you, if you're available.

Easier than training
a new girl every day.

That'd be great.

Only thing is,
Mr. Pratt, Sr.

Uncle Matt, we call him,
he's kind of conservative.

He's a deacon at First Baptist.

I'm sure that outfit
would have been great

at your last office, but--

Shit, really? Gasps Shit.

Oh, fuck-- mm. Sorry.

It's okay.
Just button up a little bit

and it'll all be all right.

Please tell your father
I'm a big fan.



- It's truth, you see?
- What's truth?

That you are no good for Fiona.

What the hell do you know?

I know you
are not meant for this life.

You are a rich boy,
born with a silver spoon, eh?

It's okay not to be ashamed.

I am from the favela.
Okay?

And now I have silver spoon.
You can go that way.

But the other way?
Scoffs

That way is just misery.

Bitter. Resent. Miseria.

It's better you should go now,
before Fiona and

the kids get more, uh,
what's the--

- Attached.
- Attached, yes.

Or before you and Fiona
make a baby together.

'Cause after a baby,

then it's misery, bitter,
resent forever.

Men, we need space to think.

So walk, think.

This time,
I will not follow you.

Thanks, man.

Hey, but if you break any laws,

I will chop off
both your hands, eh?

I got it.

You use that Mandela speech
in all the applications?

No, mixed it up a little bit.

Couple of dead presidents
and some guy called "Gandy."

Gandhi?

I don't get why
you'd want me to go to MIT.

You know,
Boston's pretty far away.

I thought maybe you'd take me
with you, but--

But what?

No one's ever been
as good to me as you have.

You're better than this
neighborhood.

You're better
than anyone I've ever met.

And you deserve to get out--

even if you
don't take me with you,

which I never really
thought you would anyway.

So is it true?

You're getting married?

So who is it?
Is it Angie Zahgo

or some other piece of trash
you screw so you can pretend

I don't matter to you?

Hey, what the fuck, Gallagher?
Glass shatters

Oh, he speaks!

So that's it. We're over.

Your dad beats the shit
out of us,

and you're just gonna
get married, no conversation?

Nothing?

Get the fuck off me.

That make you feel like a man?

Come on. Go ahead!

She's good for me,

What about boys?

What about them?

- None that like me.

I'm not pretty like Fiona.

Um, is there anything to eat?

Mom?

Jesus. What-fucking-ever!

Clatter Hey!

Stomping upstairs

What did she do that's so bad
that you won't talk to her?

She wrote the Wongs and
told them to take Hymie away.

She told them I was crazy and

that I had Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder

and that
I was bad for the baby.

I do have
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,

but I-I've been working
really hard to treat it.

And my meds have been
really working.

And I am a little crazy,

but I'm not bad for that baby.

That part's just not true.

Sheila?

Yeah, honey?

I've seen crazy,
and I've seen bad for kids.

You aren't
either of those things.

You're super nice.

I've made a lot of mistakes.

Then say you're sorry.

Because if Monica came back,
said she was sorry,

and stayed...
I'd forgive her.

I would forgive her
for everything,

because she's my mom.

I'm so...

sorry your mom left you.

But you-- you know
it's not your fault, right?

Do you know that?
It's not your fault.

these days, so it'll be awesome
to have somewhere new to go.

And all I have to do
is poke one hole in a condom,

and he'll do
whatever I say forever.

I mean, we learned that
from last time.

Fuck you.

Oh, you mean, like,
all three of us?

Yeah, I could be down for that.

Do you want me to ask Lip
next time we do it?

 Aren't you the one
who tried to hurt me

 when you said good-bye?

 Did you think I'd crumble?

 Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

 Oh, no, not I

 I will survive  Oh, yeah.

All:  Oh, as long
as I know how to love

 I know I'll stay alive

 I've got

or a rock.
Do you have a rock?

I give really good blowjobs.

Siren blaring

Are you sure you don't want one?

Do you know how many
nerve endings

are in the foreskin of a penis?

I don't think there's
a single guy who wishes

he had more nerves down there.

Well, what if our son
wants to be a transsexual?

They will need that skin
to make him a proper vagina.

Why is that even a question?

The gays brought
the gift baskets, Kevin.

Look at all the gift baskets.

I'm saying, it's a possibility.

What's all this?

Frank told the world he's gay.

And the gay world responded
with chocolate and cheese.

- And good wine.
- Wow.

Debs, school,
why didn't you go?

Sheila was depressed,

- Monica depressed.
- Code pink.

I'm sorry
you had to deal with that.

- Is Frank really gay?
- No. Laughs

Carl, it's a scam.
It's always some kind of scam.

This scam tastes awesome.

Indistinct chatter downstairs

Knock at door

Come in.

Hi. Honey, hi.

Mom, I am not
in the mood right now.

I'm sorry I was so crazy
when you were little.

I-I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to get my meds balanced.

And I'm sorry
that I missed so many

of your school events because
I couldn't leave the house.

And I--

I'm sorry that I-I took up
with your husband,

even if you didn't want him.

It's just a-- well, just
a terrible thing

for a mother to do.

There-- there are so many ways
I wish I--

I could have been
a better mother to you.

I-I hope you can forgive me,
Karen.

I hope we can start over,
because I--

Sobs

I love you so very much.

I love you so much.

I--

are you seeing Lip again?

I hope so.

Okay.

Fuck you too.
Stupid bitch.

Christopher!

Go away, Frank.
You're drunk.

You need a meeting.
Go away.

Christopher, why?

It was so good between us.

I'm sorry, Frank.

Mom says
this is how it has to be.

No, Chris, wait. Wait, Chris! Ohh!

So you like emergency
medicine, right?

Hours suck.
But, yeah, I love it.

And it's a shorter track
than surgery, right?

- Barely.
- Incoming ambulance.

Serious head trauma,
two minutes out.

All right.

- How's the money?
- The money's good.

And the saving people's lives
is pretty great, too.

You mean, like,
the adrenaline rush?

What's going on, man?

You thinking about
going back to school?

You know, thought I hated
med school, but U of M's

looking pretty damn great
right now.

Mr. Gallagher,
when you're ready to rise,

we'd like to buy you a meal
and have a chat.

What'd you hit?

Girl at school.

Don't forget to check for hair
behind the grill.

Call Manny
about the windshield.

We've looked into
your records, Frank.

You're an alcoholic,
a derelict.

Not the kind of man
we usually want on our side.

But you, my friend, have
stumbled ass over Teakettle

into the most
significant moment

in the history
of the gay rights movement.

We both know that
we're not second-class citizens,

but there are a lot of people
in this country

who still need convincing.

And you are the missing piece
in our puzzle.

You blue-collar, working-class,
Irish-Catholic.

You have the ears of the people

whose minds most need changing.

You also have dog shit on
your face and no place to live,

but we can fix that
if you agree to work with us.

You've got my attention, Mr.--

Paige. Abraham Paige.

We'll clean you up.
We'll house you.

We'll coach you.

Do you remember
"Joe The Plumber"?

Heard of him?
He's a personal hero of mine.

Well, you are gay Joe.

- Frank the plumber?
- No.

Frank, the father.

Frank, the son.
Frank, the neighbor.

Frank, the face
of the gay-rights movement.

Oh, jeez.

- Oh.
- Take it.

- Ow.
- Take it. This shit. Yeah.

- Ow.
- Take it, you little gimp.

Turn over.
Mama's gonna give you an exam.

Groans

- Take it.
- Ow.

- Take it.
- Ow.

Don't you shit on my hand.
You hear me?

- Yeah. Ooh. Take it.
- Ow.

Yeah.

Ah!

Both moaning





For all of you who were
too fucking busy,

this is what happened
last week on Shameless.

Why is that man
driving your car?

You let him steal it?

No, Beto, I stole it,

back when life was fun
and the world had meaning.

My partner works for this city.

Because we're not married,

I'm not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits.

You told the world we're gay.

You, my friend,
have stumbled into

the most significant moment

in the history
of the gay rights movement.

You also have dog shit
on your face

and no place to live,

but we can fix that,
if you agree to work with us.

And look at Mickey, marrying
some whore he knocked up.

So is it true?
You're getting married?

You love me.

And you're gay.
Just admit it.

Just this once,
admit it. Ugh!

- You're the temp?
- Yeah, hi.

Yes.
Fiona Gallagher.

Some of the office bitches
may have narced on you

about the porn at your desk
and the personal phone calls.

Well, Mr. Pratt
is asking for a word with you.

- Am I fired?
- No, you're-- you're-- Clears throat

No more naked body parts
at your desk

for any reason.

- Got it.
- And also,

you're doing a great job.

Just the man
I was hoping to run into.

I can't see you anymore.
I'm with Mandy now.

- Who's this?
- It's Karen Jackson.

- Fuck you.
- Oh, you mean, like,

all three of us?

Do you want me to ask Lip
next time we do it?

Okay, I'm sorry, mom.

It's-- it's Lip.
He wants to meet at the park.

Still asleep.

Karen or Lip?

Both.

Having a job does that to me.

You good with Liam duty

Me and Liam
are deeply bonded bros.

Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

Uh, yeah, cool.
Can you walk with me?

Yeah.

- Mwa. Bye, see you later.
- Bye.

- Bye!
- Be good for Jimmy.

Hey, here.
Thanks.

How 'bout
I just give you the headline?

Sure, newsboy.
Headline away.

Okay.

"Helping the world
be a better place."

Laughing Yeah, how's that?

I'm thinking about
going back to medical school.

What?

I already finished two years,
only have one to go.

I'm just thinking it might be
the right thing to do for us.

Future and all.
Stability.

Isn't med school really hard?
And expensive?

Yes, but the payoff's great.

Six figures,
and I'll take out loans.

Doesn't work out,
I'll just default.

Chuckles "Doctor Jimmy," huh?

Yeah, spit-balling.

Okay. Well,
I'm off to sell cups

to people that use them.

Not as exciting
as medical school,

but exciting nonetheless.

Laughter Hey.

Okay, let's get started.

You all know why you're here.

You've seen his story
on the news,

on Twitter feeds,
on your Facebook walls.

His is a tale
of a lifetime in the closet,

of a brave midlife embrace
of his true nature,

and an acknowledgment
that he is a lightning rod

for a vital civil rights issue.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Frank Gallagher.

Frank?

Cheers and applause

Um...

We're at a--
we are at a crucial time

in our nation's history.

Where, as a nation, we'll either
pivot toward what's right...

or, um... stay stuck
in what's wrong,

and make no mistake, right now,
it's a horrible time to be gay.

And I, like all of you,
have experienced it firsthand.

Apparently,
I've caused a ruckus

because I said that gay folks
deserve certain civil rights--

rights that the breeders
don't want to bestow upon me.

Laughter
Ha, ha, ha. Upon we. Laughs

Those breeders,
all they wanna do is stop us

from having the sex
that they wish they were having.

Laughs

Cheers and applause

If... if--

if the kind of sex we're having
is what offends them most,

they should let us get married,

'cause anybody
who's been married

knows that the sex
is downhill from there.

Laughter and applause

Now, we have long-- thank you.
We have long been wronged,

and it's time for legislation

that allows our private parts
to be aroused

by the people God intended
to arouse them.

Laughs Cheers and applause

And--

and it's time for that arousal
to happen within marriage!

So get out your wallets,
or your-- your man purses,

or whatever, and give now,

'cause I hope never to be
up again this early,

unless it's rolling over
with a couple of you in bed.

Cheers and applause

Thank you.
I love you. Laughs

Shit, you're good!
How did you get so good?

My whole life, I've been
trying to convince people

to do what they really
don't want to do.

Laughs
The-- the envelope, kind sir?

Thank you, thank you.

Now, we gotta talk about
upgrading my room.

Uh, you can tip the front desk

with some of my recently
departed hard-earned cash.

The front desk
at the Merchant Motor Inn

is behind bulletproof glass.

It's plexiglass.

You have a queen bed
and premium channels.

You saw what I did here.
I'm your new rainmaker.

I can get these rump-swappers
to cough up cash night and day.

"Rump-swappers"?

There's a slur
I've never heard before.

Okay, we'll see how
the high school speech goes,

but until then,
you're still on the clock,

so go shake some hands,
ya little rump-swapper.

Gasps

You saucy tart, you.

Grunts

Sighs

Sorry about that.

It happens.

Look, it's not you.
I just, I...

I can't get Karen getting hit
by that car out of my mind.

Hey.

Hey, wait a minute.
I can focus.

I'm late for school.
We can give each other head

in the shed behind
the football field at lunch.

It is hard to turn down
head in the shed,

but I might not
make it there by lunch.

Gotta stop by the hospital,
see if Karen's okay.

She's in a coma.

No, I know, I just...
wanna show some support.

She won't even know
that you're there.

Still,
it's the right thing to do.

Well, you want me to come with?

No, I'm cool.

_

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Your brow is furrowed.

Oh, that's its natural state.

- Laughs
- Actually, my boyfriend

just kinda sprung some news
on me as I was leaving.

What's your guy want,
a night out with the boys?

New pickup truck?

Actually, he's thinking about
going back to medical school.

Wow, you're dating a doctor.

New K-cups came in!

Whoo! Whoo!
Cheers

I need me
my French vanilla supreme!

Hells, yeah! And a black tiger
for the con-woman!

- Whoo!
- We got to celebrate.

Fiona's fiance
is gonna be a doctor.

He's not my fiance.

- Yet.
- Put your hooks in him, girl.

Doctors are rich.

All right, K-cups are in.
Fantastic.

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

I-- no, not really.

Well, what flavor's
your "K" cup poison?

- Never had one.
- Gasps What?

Well, let us usher you across
the workplace coffee frontier.

She ain't gonna need
a workplace much longer.

Yeah, soon, she'll have
her servants

bringing her coffee
out of a silver chalice.

Laughter
Okay, come on now, stop.

- Oh.
- No, seriously, keep going.

Laughter

Overlapping chatter

Morning, Mandy.

Why does Lip give a fuck
whether that bitch Karen

is alive or dead?

It's a mystery.

What was all that about?

You, Karen,
the unfathomable male soul.

Laughs
Why aren't you in school?

Skipping.

Debs, we need at least
one person in this family

to not turn cynical,
and my money's been on you.

I made soup for Sheila.

That's nice.
I'm gonna drop by the hospital.

I'll take it for you.

And take the credit
for doing something nice

when you actually did nothing?

Well, to be fair,
at that point,

I will have carried it
all the way over there, so--

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

Why?
What'd she tell you?

She's kind, she's devoted,

she's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore,

so stop being a dope,

and put her feelings first
every once in a while.

School is a time to experiment
with your minds

and with your genitalia.

Now, the human genitalia, to me,
is like a homing device--

God's compass.
Huh?

And each of us has it,

and it guides us
to our destined homes.

Now, our devices don't work
if we try to point 'em

in a direction that they
don't want to go in. Laughs

He needs to tone it down,
please.

But, you know,
I laugh for a point,

because let people chow down

on the nether region
of their choice--

male, female,
consenting animal.

Stop-- uh...

what are you "killing"?

The swelling appears to have
gone down in her brain,

so I'm killing the meds
that induce the coma.

Oh, okay.
Excuse me.

I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

I'm removing some of her meds.

- Okay. N-- I'm sorry--
- Hey!

- Yes?
- I'm a nice guy.

Patient, not usually
a violent dude,

but if you try to leave here
one more time

without telling us
what's going on

in words we can understand,

I will your lift
your tiny body over my head

and throw you out the window.

Your wife has sustained
serious trauma to her brain.

So you said
that you're removing

the meds that induce the coma.

Does that mean
she's gonna wake up soon?

That is one possibility.

What are
the other possibilities?

That she won't wake up soon,

or that she won't wake up ever.

But if she does wake up,
will she be okay?

We won't know how much damage
there is until she wakes.

Well, can we help her wake up?

Is she-- can she hear us
in there?

Nobody knows,

and I don't want to get myself
thrown out the window.

Mouthing words

Sweetie?

Time to wake up.

- Oh.
- You didn't know that?

Ah, come on, V, I only got
so much in the hard drive.

Remembering
your mom's menstrual cycle

is not a top priority.

Want me to go to Walgreen's,
get a pee stick?

- Honestly?
- No, no, lie to me.

I hear
it makes marriages thrive.

Eat.

I'll get a pee stick,
we'll call your mom,

and we'll watch her take a piss.
It'll be fun.

Mickey getting married,
does that make sense to you?

What sense needs to be made?

Someone's pregnant,
someone got them pregnant,

and that's...
why marriage was invented.

They been going out long?

Who knows, I wasn't in
on the courting, or the fucking.

So where did they meet?

No time soon.
Listen,

I'm thinking about taking
a little vacation to Michigan.

I hope it's not to commandeer

Laughs In Michigan?

I quit before I could finish,
and I only have

a couple of semesters left
to get my degree,

- so--
- So not a vacation?

Not exactly, no.

So why the step-stutter?
Why not tell me that

- from the beginning?
- It's "stutter-step," okay?

I was testing the waters first.

It's good for me, and for you.

I'll be keeping out of trouble,
keeping my nose clean.

In Michigan?

Yes.

I work for
"Return To Paradise Project."

We're a transformational
ministry

specializing
in conversion therapy.

We return homosexuals to healthy
heterosexual lifestyles.

Why would you go do that?

We believe that homosexuality
is curable.

Though some find pleasure in it,
homosexuality is an addiction,

an addiction
that tears families apart.

I have a gay son.
Never have to worry

about him impregnating
some skanky neighborhood slut

and bringing home
her unplanned-for half-breed.

I wish I'd known I was gay
back then.

dominated by gays.
Entertainment, politics,

broadcasting.

Tennis.

Helping the oppressed.

They're addicted,
not oppressed,

and we can pay you more.

How much more?

Stipend, room, board,

and substantial speaking fees
upon completion of therapy.

Laughs
I draw the line at therapy.

But Frank, see, without
the therapy, there's no cure.

I want to be able to say
we cured you.

Gay is who I am now.
Gay is who I shall be.

Frank, you once walked
the true path

of heterosexual love.

If I were to redirect you
back onto that path,

you'll be a much more compelling
speaker for our cause,

because you'll have been singed
by the fires of hell,

but lived to tell.

Our therapy works.

It starts
with aversion techniques,

conditioning you to avoid
certain gay-sex triggers.

Clinical fornication
would start

once you've practiced
some of those techniques.

Sorry, clinical fornication?

We house you
in the Delacroix Hotel,

and deliver women to you
to have sex with

until you're cured.

I-I-I'm sorry,
I interrupted you. What--?

We feel this is
a lesser sin than sodomy.

I grant that this seems
unconventional,

but new ideas are necessary
to counter unwavering plagues.

We're paving a road
back to God,

and the devil
has erected obstacles

that call for rule-bending
in service of a greater good.

Throw in
some walking around money,

and I'll give it a shot.

Well, did it work?

once or twice,

Went to her house, her work.

She's avoiding me.
Must be bad news.

- Think positive.
- I've done that

for the past two months,

and every time
she pees on the stick,

it's bad news,
and then I get depressed

thinking about
my husband banging my mom,

'cause we selfishly want to have
a baby with some of our DNA--

and maybe my mom
can't get pregnant anymore,

and we've crossed this line
for no reason,

and every time I'm reminded
it's not me banging my husband,

and it's not me
peeing on the stick,

and it's not me
that gets to have the baby!

V, your mom wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't for you.

Kev's only doing this
because he loves you.

There'd be no baby without you.

They all love you so much.
This is all about you.

So you're gonna get some wine,
get the stick,

get your mom in the bathroom,
and if you get bad news,

get drunk,

and we'll figure out
what comes next.

Debs, Carl, bedtime!

See these?

Can you buy me braces
like you paid for Carl's?

Aw, Debbie,
they don't look so bad.

- Ee!
- Shut up!

Yeah, if "not that bad"
means one going this way

and one going that way.
Then yeah.

Well, they add character.

I have red hair, freckles,
and crooked teeth.

Don't need any more character.

Okay, listen, things are
a little tight right now,

but I'll make it happen, soon.
I promise, okay?

So...

medical school, huh?

I... I mean,
I put in a ton of work,

and I just got thinking
that maybe I should go back

and finish
what I started. I--

- I think it's great.
- Really?

Yeah.

You're smart,
you care about people,

- you're a good person.
- Mmm.

Getting Carl braces,
Debbie braces,

taking care of Liam.

Mmm. Mmm.

Look how much
you cared for all of us,

without getting much in return.

Hey, I get plenty in return.

I'm behind you
all the way. Mwa!

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

'Cause I'm gonna need it.

Plenty of work.
Plenty of hours.

So where would you go?

University of Chicago?
Northwestern?

Northwestern could work.

Yeah, just gotta
check into it, but...

plenty of options.

These mini-bottles
are a little too mini.

I need to get
some of the big boys up here.

Will do.

I brought you some media
that needs to be viewed

before we can begin
the conversion process.

Okey-dokey. I'll get started
on this one pronto.

You have been married before?

Still am, but she never
really floated my boat.

I did my husbandly duty
to keep her happy,

but it was always
without pleasure

or joy.
Groaning on the TV

- Kids?
- A few.

So you have committed
the loving act

of heterosexual copulation?

It was always
under the influence, frankly.

Had to
to get the plumbing to work.

No, we think
you just got sidetracked.

With your history
of female contact,

we can begin the clinical
fornication stage immediately.

I doubt it'll work,
but I'll give it my best efforts

if you think it might help.

Would you tell him
that Abraham is looking for him,

and that he can reach me
at that number?

Uh, I remember best
when I'm tipped to do so.

Mr. Abraham, I will see to it
that he gets your message.

Thank you.

- Frank, this is Scotty.
- Hi, Frank.

Could you excuse us
just one second? I--

I am not gonna stop fucking men

to start fucking women
who look like men.

This is a ministry,
not a brothel.

The volunteers who are ready

are teamed with others
who are ready.

Thanks for being here
and doing this with me.

Scotty's been with us for
six months of hard, devoted work

trying to overcome
her lesbian tendencies.

You're going to help
each other.

It's been a long road,
but I want to be right with God.

As does Frank.
Don't you, Frank?

It's always good
to have God in your corner.

The goal of this stage
is to stimulate one another,

and see if stimulation can
lead to copulation and orgasm.

Okay, uh, you're anxious to go.

I'm gonna slip out before
you slip off anything else.

Is this really happening?

God willing.

birth control,

but as an extra precaution
against STDs,

please use the condoms

I provided for you
in the bathroom.

Be like Adam and Eve,

for the first time
in the Garden of Eden--

naked, discovering each other,
bringing to each other

the pleasure
that God intended for them.

No shame, no guilt,
no knowledge of things

that distract us
from God's love.

could use some updating.

No, uh,
I'm sorry, I--

I wasn't very nice to Karen...

the last time I saw her.

Actually, I, uh...
I kind of ended it,

and I didn't do it very well,

and I don't want that to be
the last she heard from me.

It won't be.

We're thinking positive.
Makes a difference.

She's gonna wake up,

and you didn't
make her sad, Lip.

She was so happy when she got
that text from you.

She knew
you were texting to make up.

You should've seen her
light up.

- Text?
- The night of the accident,

when she came to meet you.

that she was so excited,

she just forgot

I can apply for schools here,

have to start over, and lose
all the work I've already done.

It's only for a year.

that you're her prince.

a little girl,

I would read to her from this
old, old book of fairy tales.

They're dark, the old ones.
They're twisted and scary,

and she would hold my hand
and squeeze it really tight

when the witches
and the poisoned apples--

and wait for the kiss
of true love, and when it came,

she would smile and say
"mama, read it again."

She grew up,
and I took her prince.

You're hers.

that he is a lightning rod

for a vital civil rights issue.

Um...

We're at a--
we are at a crucial time

in our nation's history.

Where, as a nation, we'll either
pivot toward what's right...

or, um... stay stuck
in what's wrong,

and make no mistake, right now,
it's a horrible time to be gay.

And I, like all of you,
have experienced it firsthand.

Apparently,
I've caused a ruckus

because I said that gay folks
deserve certain civil rights--

rights that the breeders
don't want to bestow upon me.

Laughter
Ha, ha, ha. Upon we. Laughs

Those breeders,
all they wanna do is stop us

from having the sex
that they wish they were having.

Laughs

Cheers and applause

If... if--

if the kind of sex we're having
is what offends them most,

they should let us get married,

'cause anybody
who's been married

knows that the sex
is downhill from there.

Laughter and applause

Now, we have long-- thank you.
We have long been wronged,

and it's time for legislation

that allows our private parts
to be aroused

by the people God intended
to arouse them.

Laughs Cheers and applause

And--

and it's time for that arousal
to happen within marriage!

So get out your wallets,
or your-- your man purses,

or whatever, and give now,

'cause I hope never to be
up again this early,

unless it's rolling over
with a couple of you in bed.

Cheers and applause

Thank you.
I love you. Laughs

Hells, yeah! And a black tiger
for the con-woman!

- Whoo!
- We got to celebrate.

Fiona's fiance
is gonna be a doctor.

He's not my fiance.

- Yet.
- Put your hooks in him, girl.

Doctors are rich.

All right, K-cups are in.
Fantastic.

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

I-- no, not really.

Well, what flavor's
your "K" cup poison?

- Never had one.
- Gasps What?

Well, let us usher you across
the workplace coffee frontier.

She ain't gonna need
a workplace much longer.

Yeah, soon, she'll have
her servants

bringing her coffee
out of a silver chalice.

Okay, come on now, stop.

- Oh.
- No, seriously, keep going.

Overlapping chatter

Morning, Mandy.

Why does Lip give a fuck
whether that bitch Karen

is alive or dead?

It's a mystery.

What was all that about?

You, Karen,
the unfathomable male soul.

Laughs
Why aren't you in school?

Skipping.

Debs, we need at least
one person in this family

to not turn cynical,
and my money's been on you.

I made soup for Sheila.

That's nice.
I'm gonna drop by the hospital.

I'll take it for you.

And take the credit
for doing something nice

when you actually did nothing?

Well, to be fair,
at that point,

I will have carried it
all the way over there, so--

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

Why?
What'd she tell you?

She's kind, she's devoted,

she's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore,

so stop being a dope,

and put her feelings first
every once in a while.

School is a time to experiment
with your minds

and with your genitalia.

Now, the human genitalia, to me,
is like a homing device--

God's compass.
Huh?

And each of us has it,

and it guides us
to our destined homes.

Now, our devices don't work
if we try to point 'em

in a direction that they
don't want to go in. Laughs

He needs to tone it down,

what are you "killing"?

The swelling appears to have
gone down in her brain,

so I'm killing the meds
that induce the coma.

Oh, okay.
Excuse me.

I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

I'm removing some of her meds.

- Okay. N-- I'm sorry--
- Hey!

Your wife has sustained
serious trauma to her brain.

So you said
that you're removing

the meds that induce the coma.

Does that mean
she's gonna wake up soon?

That is one possibility.

What are
the other possibilities?

That she won't wake up soon,

or that she won't wake up ever.

But if she does wake up,
will she be okay?

We won't know how much damage
there is until she wakes.

Well, can we help her wake up?

Is she-- can she hear us
in there?

Nobody knows,

and I don't want to get myself
thrown out the window.

your mom's menstrual cycle

Want me to go to Walgreen's,

Eat.

I'll get a pee stick,
we'll call your mom,

It'll be fun.

Mickey getting married,
does that make sense to you?

What sense needs to be made?

Someone's pregnant,
someone got them pregnant,

and that's...
why marriage was invented.

They been going out long?

Who knows, I wasn't in

Not exactly, no.

- It's "stutter-step," okay?

I was testing the waters first.

It's good for me, and for you.

I'll be keeping out of trouble,
keeping my nose clean.

Alistair Huddleston.

To men.

I work for
"Return To Paradise Project."

We're a transformational
ministry

specializing
in conversion therapy.

We return homosexuals to healthy
heterosexual lifestyles.

Why would you go do that?

We believe that homosexuality
is curable.

Though some find pleasure in it,
homosexuality is an addiction,

an addiction
that tears families apart.

I have a gay son.
Never have to worry

about him impregnating
some skanky neighborhood slut

and bringing home
her unplanned-for half-breed.

I wish I'd known I was gay
back then.

I could've risen high
in any one of the many fields

dominated by gays.
Entertainment, politics,

broadcasting.

Tennis.

You're working
for Abraham Paige's agenda?

I'm cleaning up.
Helping the oppressed.

They're addicted,
not oppressed,

and we can pay you more.

How much more?

Stipend, room, board,

and substantial speaking fees
upon completion of therapy.

Laughs
I draw the line at therapy.

But Frank, see, without
the therapy, there's no cure.

I want to be able to say
we cured you.

Gay is who I am now.
Gay is who I shall be.

Frank, you once walked
the true path

of heterosexual love.

If I were to redirect you
back onto that path,

you'll be a much more compelling
speaker for our cause,

because you'll have been singed
by the fires of hell,

but lived to tell.

Our therapy works.

It starts
with aversion techniques,

conditioning you to avoid
certain gay-sex triggers.

Clinical fornication
would start

once you've practiced
some of those techniques.

Sorry, clinical fornication?

We house you
in the Delacroix Hotel,

and deliver women to you
to have sex with

until you're cured.

I-I-I'm sorry,
I interrupted you. What--?

We feel this is
a lesser sin than sodomy.

I grant that this seems
unconventional,

but new ideas are necessary
to counter unwavering plagues.

We're paving a road
back to God,

and the devil
has erected obstacles

that call for rule-bending
in service of a greater good.

Throw in
some walking around money,

and I'll give it a shot.

That whore
that Mickey's marrying

Dude, how did I not
know this shit?

I didn't tell you.

Well, did it work?

I mean, he might've faked it
once or twice,

but he wants to be with me.

I know what he felt with me.
You can't fake that.

And now,
this chick is pregnant.

Ian, my brother,
you need to get out there

and fuck someone new, okay?

And someone in his early 20s,

not some old dude
like Kash or Ned.

Is your mom not pregnant again?

Can't find her.
Went to her house, her work.

She's avoiding me.
Must be bad news.

- Think positive.
- I've done that

for the past two months,

and every time
she pees on the stick,

it's bad news,
and then I get depressed

thinking about
my husband banging my mom,

'cause we selfishly want to have
a baby with some of our DNA--

and maybe my mom
can't get pregnant anymore,

and we've crossed this line
for no reason,

and every time I'm reminded
it's not me banging my husband,

and it's not me
peeing on the stick,

and it's not me
that gets to have the baby!

V, your mom wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't for you.

Kev's only doing this
because he loves you.

There'd be no baby without you.

They all love you so much.
This is all about you.

So you're gonna get some wine,
get the stick,

get your mom in the bathroom,
and if you get bad news,

get drunk,

and we'll figure out
what comes next.

Who needs

Can you buy me braces

Aw, Debbie,
they don't look so bad.

- Ee!
- Shut up!

Yeah, if "not that bad"
means one going this way

and one going that way.
Then yeah.

Well, they add character.

I have red hair, freckles,
and crooked teeth.

Don't need any more character.

Okay, listen, things are
a little tight right now,

but I'll make it happen, soon.
I promise, okay?

So...

Don't you, Frank?

It's always good
to have God in your corner.

The goal of this stage

and see if stimulation can
lead to copulation and orgasm.

- Hey.
- I can't believe you texted me

for a second go around.

Maybe I made a mistake
coming back.

- No, no, no, no. Come on.
- Mmm.

in the demonic obsession

of same-sex sin.

We must
rid ourselves of the gay.

We just
have to keep practicing.

you should go home tonight,

Sheila,

I think we need to start
taking turns

getting some shut-eye
in a real bed.

- I think--
- Please don't say that.

- Please.
- I'm not saying

- she's not gonna wake up...
- Jody--

- I'm just saying
it's a marathon, not a sprint.

We gotta start taking care
of ourselves, for Karen.

You're a prince, Jody.

Chuckles Stop.

- You're like a prince.
- Chuckles

And I-- I think
that you're her prince.

When-- when she was
a little girl,

I would read to her from this
old, old book of fairy tales.

They're dark, the old ones.
They're twisted and scary,

and she would hold my hand
and squeeze it really tight

when the witches
and the poisoned apples--

and wait for the kiss
of true love, and when it came,

she would smile and say
"mama, read it again."

She grew up,
and I took her prince.

You're hers.

All right, cuppers, good game,
guys. Thanks for having me.

What? No, you-- what?
You've had, like,

- a half of a beer.
- Pound the rest of it, girl!

Actually, that would be
"half pounding" it. Laughs

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
hey, Uncle Matt's rules.

All cuppers get to come in
two hours late

the day after
a softball victory.

drunkenness. Laughs

- Stop it. Laughs
- Yeah, please, drink with us.

I told my brother
I'd only stay for a second.

Those little ones gotta be
in bed before midnight.

How many of those kids
are yours?

I birthed none,
yet I'm responsible for all.

Wait until you marry

you'll have your own
Irish brood.

All: Go cuppers!

Oh, thank you. Bye!
All right.

That must be the doctor.

Mm-hmm.

- Yup. Laughs
- All right, guys,

come on, come on, stop staring.

- Why?
- Amateurs.

Were we staring?

How was the game?

Walk-off win.
I scored.

You knew, didn't you?

- Knew what?
- Michigan.

You knew you were gonna have to
move back from the beginning.

What? No.

Please don't be
the guy who lies!

Please, don't be that guy.

Yes... probably.
N-not for sure, but yes.

- I'm tired, dude.
- Fiona.

- Fiona!
- Laughing What?

I need a change.

From me?

You know
that's not what I meant.

what you want to tell me

when you decide
you want to tell it to me.

I love you.

Great.

For all of you who were
too fucking busy,

this is what happened
last week on Shameless.

Why is that man
driving your car?

You let him steal it?

No, Beto, I stole it,

back when life was fun
and the world had meaning.

My partner works for this city.

Because we're not married,

I'm not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits.

You told the world we're gay.

You, my friend,
have stumbled into

the most significant moment

in the history
of the gay rights movement.

You also have dog shit
on your face

and no place to live,

but we can fix that,
if you agree to work with us.

And look at Mickey, marrying
some whore he knocked up.

So is it true?
You're getting married?

You love me.

And you're gay.
Just admit it.

Just this once,
admit it. Ugh!

- You're the temp?
- Yeah, hi.

Yes.

Okay.

"Helping the world
be a better place."

Laughing Yeah, how's that?

I'm thinking about
going back to medical school.

What?

I already finished two years,
only have one to go.

I'm just thinking it might be
the right thing to do for us.

Future and all.
Stability.

Isn't med school really hard?
And expensive?

Yes, but the payoff's great.

Six figures,
and I'll take out loans.

Doesn't work out,
I'll just default.

Chuckles "Doctor Jimmy," huh?

Yeah, spit-balling.

Okay. Well,
I'm off to sell cups

to people that use them.

Not as exciting
as medical school,

but exciting nonetheless.

Laughter Hey.

Okay, let's get started.

You all know why you're here.

You've seen his story
on the news,

on Twitter feeds,
on your Facebook walls.

His is a tale
of a lifetime in the closet,

of a brave midlife embrace
of his true nature,

and an acknowledgment
that he is a lightning rod

for a vital civil rights issue.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Frank Gallagher.

Frank?

Cheers and applause

Um...

We're at a--
we are at a crucial time

in our nation's history.

Where, as a nation, we'll either
pivot toward what's right...

or, um... stay stuck
in what's wrong,

and make no mistake, right now,
it's a horrible time to be gay.

And I, like all of you,
have experienced it firsthand.

Apparently,
I've caused a ruckus

because I said that gay folks
deserve certain civil rights--

rights that the breeders
don't want to bestow upon me.

Laughter
Ha, ha, ha. Upon we. Laughs

Those breeders,
all they wanna do is stop us

from having the sex
that they wish they were having.

Laughs

Cheers and applause

If... if--

if the kind of sex we're having
is what offends them most,

they should let us get married,

'cause anybody
who's been married

knows that the sex
is downhill from there.

Laughter and applause

Now, we have long-- thank you.
We have long been wronged,

and it's time for legislation

that allows our private parts
to be aroused

by the people God intended
to arouse them.

Laughs Cheers and applause

And--

and it's time for that arousal
to happen within marriage!

So get out your wallets,
or your-- your man purses,

or whatever, and give now,

'cause I hope never to be
up again this early,

unless it's rolling over
with a couple of you in bed.

Cheers and applause

Thank you.
I love you. Laughs

Shit, you're good!
How did you get so good?

My whole life, I've been
trying to convince people

to do what they really
don't want to do.

Laughs
The-- the envelope, kind sir?

Thank you, thank you.

Now, we gotta talk about
upgrading my room.

Uh, you can tip the front desk

with some of my recently
departed hard-earned cash.

The front desk
at the Merchant Motor Inn

is behind bulletproof glass.

It's plexiglass.

You have a queen bed
and premium channels.

You saw what I did here.
I'm your new rainmaker.

I can get these rump-swappers
to cough up cash night and day.

"Rump-swappers"?

There's a slur
I've never heard before.

Okay, we'll see how
the high school speech goes,

but until then,
you're still on the clock,

so go shake some hands,
ya little rump-swapper.

Gasps

You saucy tart, you.

Grunts

Sighs

Sorry about that.

It happens.

Look, it's not you.
I just, I...

I can't get Karen getting hit
by that car out of my mind.

Hey.

Hey, wait a minute.
I can focus.

I'm late for school.
We can give each other head

in the shed behind
the football field at lunch.

It is hard to turn down
head in the shed,

but I might not
make it there by lunch.

Gotta stop by the hospital,
see if Karen's okay.

She's in a coma.

No, I know, I just...
wanna show some support.

She won't even know
that you're there.

Still,
it's the right thing to do.

Well, you want me to come with?

No, I'm cool.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Your brow is furrowed.

Oh, that's its natural state.

- Laughs
- Actually, my boyfriend

just kinda sprung some news
on me as I was leaving.

Actually, he's thinking about
going back to medical school.

Wow, you're dating a doctor.

New K-cups came in!

Whoo! Whoo!
Cheers

my French vanilla supreme!

Hells, yeah! And a black tiger
for the con-woman!

- Whoo!
- We got to celebrate.

Fiona's fiance
is gonna be a doctor.

He's not my fiance.

- Yet.
- Put your hooks in him, girl.

Doctors are rich.

All right, K-cups are in.
Fantastic.

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

I-- no, not really.

Well, what flavor's
your "K" cup poison?

- Never had one.
- Gasps What?

Well, let us usher you across
the workplace coffee frontier.

She ain't gonna need
a workplace much longer.

Yeah, soon, she'll have
her servants

bringing her coffee
out of a silver chalice.

Okay, come on now, stop.

- Oh.
- No, seriously, keep going.

Morning, Mandy.

Why does Lip give a fuck

is alive or dead?

the unfathomable male soul.

Why aren't you in school?

Skipping.

Debs, we need at least
one person in this family

to not turn cynical,
and my money's been on you.

I made soup for Sheila.

That's nice.
I'm gonna drop by the hospital.

I'll take it for you.

And take the credit
for doing something nice

when you actually did nothing?

Well, to be fair,
at that point,

I will have carried it
all the way over there, so--

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

Why?
What'd she tell you?

She's kind, she's devoted,

she's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore,

so stop being a dope,

and put her feelings first
every once in a while.

School is a time to experiment
with your minds

and with your genitalia.

Now, the human genitalia, to me,
is like a homing device--

God's compass.
Huh?

And each of us has it,

and it guides us
to our destined homes.

Now, our devices don't work
if we try to point 'em

in a direction that they
don't want to go in. Laughs

He needs to tone it down,

that induce the coma.

Oh, okay.

- Okay. N-- I'm sorry--
- Hey!

a violent dude,

but if you try to leave here
one more time

without telling us
what's going on

in words we can understand,

I will your lift
your tiny body over my head

and throw you out the window.

Your wife has sustained
serious trauma to her brain.

So you said
that you're removing

the meds that induce the coma.

Does that mean
she's gonna wake up soon?

That is one possibility.

What are
the other possibilities?

That she won't wake up soon,

or that she won't wake up ever.

But if she does wake up,
will she be okay?

We won't know how much damage
there is until she wakes.

Well, can we help her wake up?

Is she-- can she hear us
in there?

Nobody knows,

and I don't want to get myself
thrown out the window.

Eat.

I'll get a pee stick,
we'll call your mom,

To men.

I work for
"Return To Paradise Project."

We're a transformational
ministry

specializing
in conversion therapy.

We return homosexuals to healthy
heterosexual lifestyles.

Why would you go do that?

We believe that homosexuality
is curable.

Though some find pleasure in it,
homosexuality is an addiction,

an addiction
that tears families apart.

I have a gay son.
Never have to worry

about him impregnating
some skanky neighborhood slut

and bringing home
her unplanned-for half-breed.

I wish I'd known I was gay
back then.

I could've risen high

dominated by gays.
Entertainment, politics,

broadcasting.

Tennis.

You're working

Helping the oppressed.

They're addicted,
not oppressed,

and we can pay you more.

How much more?

Stipend, room, board,

and substantial speaking fees
upon completion of therapy.

Laughs
I draw the line at therapy.

But Frank, see, without
the therapy, there's no cure.

I want to be able to say
we cured you.

Gay is who I am now.
Gay is who I shall be.

Frank, you once walked
the true path

of heterosexual love.

If I were to redirect you
back onto that path,

you'll be a much more compelling
speaker for our cause,

because you'll have been singed
by the fires of hell,

but lived to tell.

Our therapy works.

It starts
with aversion techniques,

conditioning you to avoid
certain gay-sex triggers.

Clinical fornication
would start

once you've practiced
some of those techniques.

Sorry, clinical fornication?

We house you
in the Delacroix Hotel,

and deliver women to you
to have sex with

until you're cured.

I-I-I'm sorry,
I interrupted you. What--?

We feel this is
a lesser sin than sodomy.

I grant that this seems
unconventional,

but new ideas are necessary
to counter unwavering plagues.

We're paving a road
back to God,

and the devil
has erected obstacles

that call for rule-bending
in service of a greater good.

Throw in
some walking around money,

and I'll give it a shot.

That whore

from the Milkovich family?

Um...

- Bad parenting.
- Yeah.

Elevator bell dings

Prime rib for two?

Right there.
Yeah. Oh.

Phone ringing Oh, yeah.

And here you go,

and here you go.

Mr. Gallagher?
Please excuse my informality,

but I saw you on TV, and just,

on behalf
of the entire gay community,

I want to thank you
for putting yourself

in the crosshairs
of this political issue.

I mean, it's courageous
and inspiring.

Whatever you need
while you are here...

- Uh...
- ...please, just do not

- hesitate to ask.
- Ketchup.

- What?
- Ketchup.

Oh!
Absolutely, yes.

Um, my name is Jesus.

Do you need me to sign you up
for any spa treatments, or...

Well,
I'm wide-open tomorrow,

chockablock me some massages
from sunup to sundown.

Throw in a facial.

Okay-- will do.
Chuckles

Ketchup.

Oh, right!

Is it possible that my teeth

will spontaneously
straighten out on their own?

Uh, Jimmy's going
back to medical school.

We can ask him to help.

I need alcohol.

Is your mom not pregnant again?

Can't find her.
Went to her house, her work.

She's avoiding me.
Must be bad news.

- Think positive.
- I've done that

for the past two months,

and every time
she pees on the stick,

it's bad news,
and then I get depressed

thinking about
my husband banging my mom,

'cause we selfishly want to have
a baby with some of our DNA--

and maybe my mom
can't get pregnant anymore,

and we've crossed this line
for no reason,

and every time I'm reminded
it's not me banging my husband,

and it's not me
peeing on the stick,

and it's not me
that gets to have the baby!

V, your mom wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't for you.

Kev's only doing this
because he loves you.

There'd be no baby without you.

They all love you so much.
This is all about you.

So you're gonna get some wine,
get the stick,

get your mom in the bathroom,
and if you get bad news,

get drunk,

and we'll figure out
what comes next.

Who needs
root beer float coffee?

All of us.

I love you.

- Call me with the news.
- Thank you.

Debs, Carl, bedtime!

See these?

Can you buy me braces
like you paid for Carl's?

Aw, Debbie,
they don't look so bad.

- Ee!
- Shut up!

Yeah, if "not that bad"
means one going this way

and one going that way.
Then yeah.

Well, they add character.

I have red hair, freckles,
and crooked teeth.

Don't need any more character.

Okay, listen, things are
a little tight right now,

but I'll make it happen, soon.
I promise, okay?

So...

medical school, huh?

I... I mean,
I put in a ton of work,

and I just got thinking
that maybe I should go back

and finish
what I started. I--

- I think it's great.
- Really?

Yeah.

You're smart,
you care about people,

- you're a good person.
- Mmm.

Getting Carl braces,
Debbie braces,

taking care of Liam.

Mmm. Mmm.

Look how much
you cared for all of us,

without getting much in return.

Hey, I get plenty in return.

I'm behind you
all the way. Mwa!

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

'Cause I'm gonna need it.

Plenty of work.
Plenty of hours.

So where would you go?

University of Chicago?
Northwestern?

Northwestern could work.

Yeah, just gotta
check into it, but...

plenty of options.

These mini-bottles

I need to get
some of the big boys up here.

Will do.

I brought you some media
that needs to be viewed

before we can begin
the conversion process.

Okey-dokey. I'll get started
on this one pronto.

You have been married before?

Still am, but she never
really floated my boat.

I did my husbandly duty
to keep her happy,

but it was always
without pleasure

or joy.
Groaning on the TV

- Kids?
- A few.

So you have committed
the loving act

of heterosexual copulation?

It was always
under the influence, frankly.

Had to
to get the plumbing to work.

No, we think
you just got sidetracked.

With your history
of female contact,

we can begin the clinical
fornication stage immediately.

I doubt it'll work,
but I'll give it my best efforts

if you think it might help.

All right, I get it. I get it.
You're a doctor's wife.

You know, you gotta
keep up appearances.

Can't have fun
with your co-workers

or a life for yourself.
Totally understand.

O-o-okay, fine.
Text me where the field is,

blowing out a knee...

- Laughs
- I'll be there.

All right! Hey, you're not
gonna want to miss it, either.

We pop a pony keg of bud after.

- Just sayin'.
- Just sayin'.

Excuse me,
do you know where I might

be able to find
Frank Gallagher?

Best bet,
nearest jail or gutter.

Laughs

Would you tell him
that Abraham is looking for him,

and that he can reach me
at that number?

Uh, I remember best
when I'm tipped to do so.

Mr. Abraham, I will see to it
that he gets your message.

Thank you.

- Frank, this is Scotty.
- Hi, Frank.

Could you excuse us
just one second? I--

I am not gonna stop fucking men

to start fucking women
who look like men.

This is a ministry,
not a brothel.

The volunteers who are ready

are teamed with others
who are ready.

Thanks for being here
and doing this with me.

Scotty's been with us for
six months of hard, devoted work

trying to overcome
her lesbian tendencies.

You're going to help
each other.

It's been a long road,
but I want to be right with God.

As does Frank.
Don't you, Frank?

It's always good
to have God in your corner.

The goal of this stage
is to stimulate one another,

and see if stimulation can
lead to copulation and orgasm.

Okay, uh, you're anxious to go.

I'm gonna slip out before
you slip off anything else.

Is this really happening?

God willing.
The last time Alistair

brought a man in to see me,
he left in tears

Scotty has been taking
birth control,

but as an extra precaution
against STDs,

please use the condoms

I provided for you
in the bathroom.

Be like Adam and Eve,
discovering one another

for the first time
in the Garden of Eden--

naked, discovering each other,
bringing to each other

the pleasure
that God intended for them.

No shame, no guilt,
no knowledge of things

that distract us
from God's love.

She hates that.

she would like?

I don't know,

I'm gonna go get some coffee.

Jody's musical repertoire
could use some updating.

No, uh,
I'm sorry, I--

I wasn't very nice to Karen...

the last time I saw her.

Actually, I, uh...
I kind of ended it,

and I didn't do it very well,

and I don't want that to be
the last she heard from me.

It won't be.

We're thinking positive.
Makes a difference.

She's gonna wake up,

and you didn't
make her sad, Lip.

She was so happy when she got
that text from you.

She knew
you were texting to make up.

You should've seen her
light up.

- Text?
- The night of the accident,

when she came to meet you.

I honestly think
that she was so excited,

she just forgot
to look both ways.

Do you have Karen's phone here?

it could be with her things.

No, it could be good news.

I can apply for schools here,

have to start over, and lose
all the work I've already done.

It's only for a year.

I know it's a bit

that you're her prince.

a little girl,

I would read to her from this
old, old book of fairy tales.

They're dark, the old ones.
They're twisted and scary,

and she would hold my hand
and squeeze it really tight

when the witches
and the poisoned apples--

and wait for the kiss
of true love, and when it came,

she would smile and say
"mama, read it again."

She grew up,
and I took her prince.

You're hers.

that he is a lightning rod

for a vital civil rights issue.

Frank?

Cheers and applause

Um...

We're at a--
we are at a crucial time

in our nation's history.

Where, as a nation, we'll either
pivot toward what's right...

or, um... stay stuck
in what's wrong,

and make no mistake, right now,
it's a horrible time to be gay.

And I, like all of you,
have experienced it firsthand.

Apparently,
I've caused a ruckus

because I said that gay folks
deserve certain civil rights--

rights that the breeders
don't want to bestow upon me.

Laughter
Ha, ha, ha. Upon we. Laughs

Those breeders,
all they wanna do is stop us

from having the sex
that they wish they were having.

Laughs

Cheers and applause

If... if--

if the kind of sex we're having
is what offends them most,

they should let us get married,

'cause anybody
who's been married

knows that the sex
is downhill from there.

Laughter and applause

Now, we have long-- thank you.
We have long been wronged,

and it's time for legislation

that allows our private parts
to be aroused

by the people God intended
to arouse them.

Laughs Cheers and applause

And--

and it's time for that arousal
to happen within marriage!

So get out your wallets,

I love you. Laughs

trying to convince people

to do what they really
don't want to do.

Laughs
The-- the envelope, kind sir?

Thank you, thank you.

Now, we gotta talk about
upgrading my room.

Uh, you can tip the front desk

with some of my recently
departed hard-earned cash.

The front desk
at the Merchant Motor Inn

is behind bulletproof glass.

It's plexiglass.

You have a queen bed
and premium channels.

You saw what I did here.
I'm your new rainmaker.

I can get these rump-swappers
to cough up cash night and day.

"Rump-swappers"?

There's a slur
I've never heard before.

Okay, we'll see how
the high school speech goes,

but until then,
you're still on the clock,

so go shake some hands,
ya little rump-swapper.

Gasps

You saucy tart, you.

Grunts

Sighs

Sorry about that.

It happens.

Look, it's not you.
I just, I...

I can't get Karen getting hit
by that car out of my mind.

Hey.

Hey, wait a minute.
I can focus.

I'm late for school.
We can give each other head

in the shed behind
the football field at lunch.

It is hard to turn down
head in the shed,

but I might not
make it there by lunch.

Gotta stop by the hospital,
see if Karen's okay.

She's in a coma.

No, I know, I just...
wanna show some support.

She won't even know
that you're there.

Still,
it's the right thing to do.

Well, you want me to come with?

No, I'm cool.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Your brow is furrowed.

Oh, that's its natural state.

- Laughs
- Actually, my boyfriend

just kinda sprung some news
on me as I was leaving.

What's your guy want,
a night out with the boys?

New pickup truck?

Actually, he's thinking about
going back to medical school.

Wow, you're dating a doctor.

New K-cups came in!

Whoo! Whoo!
Cheers

I need me
my French vanilla supreme!

Hells, yeah! And a black tiger
for the con-woman!

- Whoo!
- We got to celebrate.

Fiona's fiance
is gonna be a doctor.

He's not my fiance.

- Yet.
- Put your hooks in him, girl.

Doctors are rich.

All right, K-cups are in.
Fantastic.

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

I-- no, not really.

Well, what flavor's
your "K" cup poison?

- Never had one.
- Gasps What?

Well, let us usher you across
the workplace coffee frontier.

She ain't gonna need
a workplace much longer.

Yeah, soon, she'll have
her servants

bringing her coffee
out of a silver chalice.

Okay, come on now, stop.

- Oh.
- No, seriously, keep going.

Morning, Mandy.

Why does Lip give a fuck
whether that bitch Karen

is alive or dead?

It's a mystery.

What was all that about?

You, Karen,
the unfathomable male soul.

Laughs
Why aren't you in school?

Skipping.

Debs, we need at least
one person in this family

to not turn cynical,
and my money's been on you.

I made soup for Sheila.

That's nice.
I'm gonna drop by the hospital.

I'll take it for you.

And take the credit
for doing something nice

when you actually did nothing?

Well, to be fair,
at that point,

I will have carried it
all the way over there, so--

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

Why?
What'd she tell you?

She's kind, she's devoted,

she's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore,

so stop being a dope,

and put her feelings first
every once in a while.

School is a time to experiment
with your minds

and with your genitalia.

Now, the human genitalia, to me,
is like a homing device--

God's compass.
Huh?

And each of us has it,

and it guides us
to our destined homes.

Now, our devices don't work
if we try to point 'em

in a direction that they
don't want to go in. Laughs

He needs to tone it down,

The swelling appears to have
gone down in her brain,

so I'm killing the meds
that induce the coma.

Oh, okay.
Excuse me.

I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

I'm removing some of her meds.

- Okay. N-- I'm sorry--
- Hey!

I will your lift
your tiny body over my head

Your wife has sustained
serious trauma to her brain.

So you said
that you're removing

the meds that induce the coma.

Does that mean
she's gonna wake up soon?

That is one possibility.

What are
the other possibilities?

That she won't wake up soon,

or that she won't wake up ever.

But if she does wake up,
will she be okay?

We won't know how much damage
there is until she wakes.

Well, can we help her wake up?

Is she-- can she hear us
in there?

Nobody knows,

and I don't want to get myself
thrown out the window.

Eat.

I'll get a pee stick,
we'll call your mom,

It'll be fun.

Mickey getting married,

What sense needs to be made?

Someone's pregnant,
someone got them pregnant,

why marriage was invented.

Not exactly, no.

So why the step-stutter?

It's good for me, and for you.

Alistair Huddleston.

To men.

I work for
"Return To Paradise Project."

We're a transformational
ministry

specializing
in conversion therapy.

We return homosexuals to healthy
heterosexual lifestyles.

Why would you go do that?

We believe that homosexuality
is curable.

Though some find pleasure in it,
homosexuality is an addiction,

an addiction
that tears families apart.

I have a gay son.
Never have to worry

about him impregnating
some skanky neighborhood slut

and bringing home
her unplanned-for half-breed.

I wish I'd known I was gay
back then.

I could've risen high
in any one of the many fields

dominated by gays.
Entertainment, politics,

broadcasting.

Tennis.

You're working
for Abraham Paige's agenda?

I'm cleaning up.
Helping the oppressed.

They're addicted,
not oppressed,

and we can pay you more.

How much more?

Stipend, room, board,

and substantial speaking fees
upon completion of therapy.

Laughs
I draw the line at therapy.

But Frank, see, without
the therapy, there's no cure.

I want to be able to say
we cured you.

Gay is who I am now.
Gay is who I shall be.

Frank, you once walked
the true path

of heterosexual love.

If I were to redirect you
back onto that path,

you'll be a much more compelling
speaker for our cause,

because you'll have been singed
by the fires of hell,

but lived to tell.

Our therapy works.

It starts
with aversion techniques,

conditioning you to avoid
certain gay-sex triggers.

Clinical fornication
would start

once you've practiced
some of those techniques.

Sorry, clinical fornication?

We house you
in the Delacroix Hotel,

and deliver women to you
to have sex with

until you're cured.

I-I-I'm sorry,
I interrupted you. What--?

We feel this is
a lesser sin than sodomy.

I grant that this seems
unconventional,

but new ideas are necessary
to counter unwavering plagues.

We're paving a road
back to God,

and the devil
has erected obstacles

that call for rule-bending
in service of a greater good.

Throw in
some walking around money,

and I'll give it a shot.

That whore
that Mickey's marrying

Dude, how did I not
know this shit?

I didn't tell you.

Well, did it work?

I mean, he might've faked it
once or twice,

but he wants to be with me.

I know what he felt with me.
You can't fake that.

And now,
this chick is pregnant.

Ian, my brother,
you need to get out there

and fuck someone new, okay?

And someone in his early 20s,

not some old dude

Can't find her.
Went to her house, her work.

She's avoiding me.
Must be bad news.

- Think positive.
- I've done that

for the past two months,

and every time
she pees on the stick,

it's bad news,
and then I get depressed

thinking about
my husband banging my mom,

'cause we selfishly want to have
a baby with some of our DNA--

and maybe my mom
can't get pregnant anymore,

and we've crossed this line
for no reason,

and every time I'm reminded
it's not me banging my husband,

and it's not me
peeing on the stick,

and it's not me
that gets to have the baby!

V, your mom wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't for you.

Kev's only doing this
because he loves you.

There'd be no baby without you.

They all love you so much.
This is all about you.

So you're gonna get some wine,
get the stick,

get your mom in the bathroom,
and if you get bad news,

get drunk,

and we'll figure out
what comes next.

Aw, Debbie,
they don't look so bad.

- Ee!
- Shut up!

Yeah, if "not that bad"
means one going this way

and one going that way.
Then yeah.

Well, they add character.

I have red hair, freckles,

Don't need any more character.

I know people, Frank.

I put the word out, they call.

I got you a better hotel.

This is for the Embassy Suites,
North State Street.

Finish your drink,
head over, get dressed.

There's clean polos
and khakis in the closet.

Your next gig is at the
Oscar Wilde Bookstore, tonight.

- Okay.
- Look sharp.

Laughs

Hey! I've been trying
to find you.

I've been avoiding you
finding me.

- Mama.
- I'm not feeling well,

and when I don't feel well,
it's usually bad news.

No, it could be good news.

The last two times,
you felt fine

and it was bad news, so maybe
this time it's good news.

No, I don't think so.

Mama, I really appreciate
all you've done

and continue to do for me.

Sighs Gimme the stick.

- Can I go with you this time?
- No!

Bathrooms have doors
for a reason.

I'll do the whizzing,
you do the waiting.

Keep your hopes in check.

All right,
everyone grab your jackets,

it might be cold, and
I don't want to wait for you.

- Get off!
- Hey!

Hey! Hungry?

Spaghetti and bread.
I made them leave you some.

Thanks.
How was work?

It was good.
It was great, actually.

I got invited
to play softball tonight.

Laughs You even own a glove?

It's Chicago-style softball.
You don't need a glove.

- Look at you, trying to fit in.
- Hmm.

I'm hoping they keep me
around for a while.

Come with. It should be fun.
We can grab a drink after.

- You can meet everyone.
- Cool.

Hey, I may have to spend
some more time in Michigan.

- What?
- Med school.

Admissions Department called
and said

that I have to finish up there
or I lose a bunch of credits.

I can apply for schools here,
but I'd basically

have to start over, and lose
all the work I've already done.

It's only for a year.

I know it's a bit
of a fly in the ointment,

but they're being really cool,
letting me re-enroll.

- There's no other option?
- Not really.

What--
not really, or no?

No.

Scoffs

Wow, that's... wow.

- You can come with me.
- To Michigan?

It's not that far.

W-- the kids?

Yeah, sure, if you want.

- If I want?
- Yes, yes, of course, them too.

Chuckles

Look, there's details
to sort through,

but they're all doable details,
totally doable details.

Uh-huh.
Uh...

I have to get ready
for softball.

Attention, people!
Kevin is gonna be a daddy!

Holy shit!
Cheers and applause

Hooray!

Frank, where the hell are you?

Call me.

Knocking at the door

- Hey.
- I can't believe you texted me

for a second go around.

Maybe I made a mistake
coming back.

- No, no, no, no. Come on.
- Mmm.

We are heteros trapped
in the demonic obsession

of same-sex sin.

We must
rid ourselves of the gay.

We just
have to keep practicing.

 It's how you get up,
then you fall

Cheers and applause

Let's go, Mike!
Come on, bring us home!

Fiona's so into softball, huh?

We need more of that
around here, Connie.

- Mike, end this thing!
- Yeah, Mike!

We don't have enough beer
for extra innings.



Cheers and applause

Screams Cheers and yelling

Oh, my God!

Put me down!

Beer!
Let's get some beer!

Should we be
planning for the worst?

She's been through
a tremendous trauma,

but I've seen miracles.
They do happen.

Just keep engaging with her,

doing things she likes that
might trigger her unconscious.

Let her know you're here.

Sighs

Sheila...

you should go home tonight,
get some sleep.

Sheila,

I think we need to start
taking turns

getting some shut-eye
in a real bed.

- I think--
- Please don't say that.

- Please.
- I'm not saying

- she's not gonna wake up...
- Jody--

- I'm just saying
it's a marathon, not a sprint.

We gotta start taking care
of ourselves, for Karen.

You're a prince, Jody.

Chuckles Stop.

- You're like a prince.
- Chuckles

And I-- I think
that you're her prince.

When-- when she was
a little girl,

I would read to her from this
old, old book of fairy tales.

They're dark, the old ones.
They're twisted and scary,

and she would hold my hand
and squeeze it really tight

when the witches
and the poisoned apples--

and wait for the kiss
of true love, and when it came,

she would smile and say
"mama, read it again."

She grew up,
and I took her prince.

You're hers.

All right, cuppers, good game,
guys. Thanks for having me.

What? No, you-- what?
You've had, like,

- a half of a beer.
- Pound the rest of it, girl!

Actually, that would be
"half pounding" it. Laughs

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
hey, Uncle Matt's rules.

All cuppers get to come in
two hours late

the day after
a softball victory.

Uncle Matt encourages
drunkenness. Laughs

- Stop it. Laughs
- Yeah, please, drink with us.

I told my brother
I'd only stay for a second.

Those little ones gotta be
in bed before midnight.

How many of those kids
are yours?

I birthed none,
yet I'm responsible for all.

Wait until you marry
the doctor,

you'll have your own
Irish brood.

Laughter

Uh, go cuppers!

All: Go cuppers!
Overlapping cheers

Finish that.

Oh, thank you. Bye!
All right.

That must be the doctor.

Mm-hmm.

- Laughs
- Did I do that out loud?

- Yup. Laughs
- All right, guys,

come on, come on, stop staring.

- Why?
- Amateurs.

Were we staring?

How was the game?

Walk-off win.
I scored.

You knew, didn't you?

- Knew what?
- Michigan.

You knew you were gonna have to
move back from the beginning.

What? No.

Please don't be
the guy who lies!

Please, don't be that guy.

Yes... probably.
N-not for sure, but yes.

- I'm tired, dude.
- Fiona.

- Fiona!
- Laughing What?

I need a change.

From me?

You know
that's not what I meant.

Clearly, I only know
what you want to tell me

when you decide
you want to tell it to me.

I love you.

Great.

Debbie needs braces.

I'm making espressos,
you're selling cups.

It's a year.

Stop saying it
like a year is nothing,

like nothing can happen
in a year,

like being away from each other
for a year wouldn't matter!

Other people do it.

I'm tired.

I gotta get up
early in the morning.

Selling cups.

Fiona?

I'm gonna be a great doctor.

I'm not arguing that.

going back to medical school.

Dr. Jimmy, huh?

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

- You can come with me.
- To Michigan?

Good luck
convincing her to move.

Fiona?

Estefania, dammit, your wife.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family.
The value of his word.

Are you a man of your word?

You don't live here anymore.

You still someone I can trust?

Mickey getting married.
Does that make sense to you?

She works at Garden Spring Spa,

if you call jerking off
random dudes "working."

Terry made Mickey fuck her
to fuck the gay out of 'em.

I know what he felt with me.

You can't fake that.

- What'd you hit?
- Girl at school.

I wasn't very nice to Karen.

She was so happy
when she got that text from you.

Text?

The night of the accident
when she came to meet you.

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

She's kind.
She's devoted.

She's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore.

Should we be
planning for the worst?

I've seen miracles.
They do happen.

Keep engaging her.

Let her know you're here.

You're a prince, Jody.

I think that you're her prince.

I took her prince.

She believed
in the kiss of true love.

You awake long?

A while.

This whole Ann Arbor thing--

we can make it work.

Been doing some research.

Worldwide Cup
has an office in Canton

only 18 miles from campus.

- Wow.
- I know, right?

I'm gonna see
if they need help.

And the public schools there

are a hell of a lot better.

I called a couple.

They actually
answered the phone.

They said that Debbie and Carl
could transfer mid-year.

They're so nice about it.

I just don't want
the kids resenting me

for making them
leave their friends at school.

What friends?
Lip's graduating.

I'm not sure what to do
about Ian yet,

but I'll ask him
when he's feeling better.

- And the house?
- Sublet it, maybe.

I don't know yet.

Wow. I mean,
you've really turned a corner.

Chuckles Yeah.

- Morning.
- Mm.

You never
came to bed last night.

Yeah, no, sorry,
I got sucked into, um...

Zambian women's boxing.

Muscular women
make me feel funny.

Sounds hot.

Can you hurry up and get ready?

I want to get to school early.

Gonna swipe
some bags of tater tots

from the cafeteria
for Mickey's wedding.

Okay, I'll be right up.

Late start this morning, guys.

- Sorry, you're on your own.
- Oh, thanks, Debs.

We're out of peanut butter.

Is Ian staying home
from school again today?

Yes, he is.
His stomach is still messed up.

- Any more pop tarts left?
- Carl finished them.

- He ate three.
- I'm a growing boy.

"Little Broski" took a big-boy
dump on the big-boy toilet!

Hey! Mwah!

We're gonna celebrate
by walking to the store

for some butt wipes.

And peanut butter
and pop tarts.

And tampons. Sorry.

And make sure he wears a hat.
It's getting cold.

- Tampons.
- Bye, family!

Bye, Fiona!
Butch it up, dude.

Growls

Dude.

You gotta get up at some point.

I'm losing my mind. I--

I can't stop thinking
about the wedding.

All right,
last time I'm gonna say it.

Do yourself a favor.

Stay as far away from that
car wreck as humanly possible.

Okay?
It's not worth it.

Can you help me set up
this afternoon at the VFW?

Uh, no, you know what?
I promised I'd go to Sheila's.

You know,
Karen's getting home tonight.

- Gotta help set up.
- I'll help.

- You sure?
- Yeah.

Hey, wait, dude,
aren't you sick?

I don't get why Jody and Sheila

can't set up
Karen's shit by themselves.

Look, she needs
a lot of stuff, okay?

She can't even
walk by herself yet.

She's got frontal lobe damage.

The dude who hit her

probably doesn't even
have a scratch on him.

 I turn to stone

 I can't go on

 I'm so alone without you

 it ended so

 can't take the toll
without you

Well, I'm not moving.

Stop it!

You're a terrible
homeless person.

I'm not homeless.
I have a home.

Then why didn't you
go there last night?

I was on my way there

when I sat down here
and accidentally fell asleep.

Bullshit. You look like a bum,
you smell like a bum.

I'm a passenger.

Get off my lawn.

All right!

I'm going!

To my house, where I live,

like a respectable human being.

I have labeled
the quarterly reports

from the last four years

with color-coded tabs,
stapled and collated.

And I've included double-sided
copies for the archive.

Oh, dang, maestro.

I was wondering
if you knew of any positions

opening up
in your Michigan office.

Uh, I could ask.
You leaving us?

My boyfriend might be
going to med school at U of M.

We're not sure yet.

Wow. That's terrific.

We'll be sad to see you go.

Me too.

Uh, sorry.

I don't know
if you're busy this weekend,

but my family has a cabin.

It's like a half an hour drive
north of here.

We go every year
during the fall,

we camp,
and toast marshmallows,

and kinda drink our faces off.

Uh...

Shit, so--

I'm doing this really,
really badly.

I am totally
inviting both of you

and the pile of kids you brought
to the softball game.

Real-- they'd have a great time.
How many are there total?

Two teens, two preteens,
and a toddler.

Perfect, I mean,
we've got extra tents,

we've got sub-zero
sleeping bags,

the little ones share a tent,

tell ghost stories,
while the adults

just get blitzed by the fire.

And I mean, tons of people
from work usually come.

It's great.

Sounds good.

My brothers
might have a wedding,

but I'll check
with the rest of the gang.

Yeah, cool. Let me know.

Okay.

I bought, and it break.

And I tried to call to complain,
but they don't understand me.

You call, yeah?

No, Estefania,
this number's for emergencies.

I'm bored, Steve.

All I do, I sit here
with textbooks, go shopping,

I get bad sex with horny boys
with tiny pintinhos.

Okay, okay.

I will go to the store later.

- Come over.
- Okay, okay.

Gotta go.

So you were able
to convince Estefania to move?

It's-- um--

it's a work in progress.
I'm working on it. Just don't--

Ah, but Fiona's
aware of your plans, I assume.

You're getting careless.

Don't.

Hey. Uh...

No, just putting together

- Chuckles
- What's up?

Um, I need your advice.

Well, if it's about infants,
college, or tiny dicks,

I'm the wrong guy.

Uh, no, it's, um--

it's about crazy.
You were married to once.

Why, is Mandy going
a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran over
Karen with her car.

What?

I think she-- she ran over
Karen with her car,

and also she-- she carries this
like huge stockpile of arms--

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

Your current girlfriend

ran over your ex-girlfriend
with a car?

Signs point to yes.
I mean, I--

I don't know. I don't know
what she's capable of.

Dude, you're at DEFCON 1.

You need to get
the fuck outta there.

Tell me how.

Very slowly.

You need to make her think
it's her idea.

Keep your distance.

Because once they get
behind the wheel,

there's no going back.

Okay. I mean, I'm--
I'm-- I'm gone a lot, you know?

They need a lot of help
over at Karen's, so--

Whoa, whoa, Lip, wait, wait.

Does Mandy know
you're going over there?

Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I told her--

- Lip, you can't
tell her that shit!

That's like waving the flag
in front of the bull!

- Well--
- Hide the car keys,

stop showering,
and you tell her nothing.

And whatever you do,
do not-- Lip.

Do not let her bone you,

because that oxytocin stuff
makes them adhesive.

You got it?

Yeah.

I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

- Fiona and Lip will be mad.
- Well, of course they will.

They treat me like a leper
because I'm "a bad father."

Yeah, right.

Tell you, you haven't
seen bad parenting

till you witness my mother
in her glory days.

Had this piece of wood
she called a retribution stick.

Flat side, skinny side.

If I did something small,
like steal an extra cookie

or piss in her shampoo bottle--
whack. Flat side.

But if I did something heinous,

like set fire to her bed
when she was napping,

or rat her out for her
garage gambling ring,

the skinny side.

Like a whip.

Whack! Whack!
Whack, whack, whack!

Whack! Whack!

Whack! But did I
throw that bitch

into the gutter
when she needed a home? No.

I brushed her hair.
I washed her saggy tits.

I irrigated her ulcers.

I nursed her
all the way to the grave.

But you people, making me
homeless in the dead of autumn?

After I got you through cancer?

I slept on a train last night!

Cool. Can I try that?

No! It's barbaric.
I have no place to go!

Do you get it?

I could sneak you
in the van tonight.

You'd do that for me?

You little piker, you.

You made it.

Chairs are over here,
and watch out for splinters.

You know, um,
Lip is still up Karen's ass.

It's getting old.

Yeah.

So, Svetlana.
She like, uh--

She's quiet.

And skinny, which is weird,

'cause he usually
bags fat chicks.

I do his laundry.

I apply to colleges for him,
and what the hell does Karen do?

Drools and farts.
I mean, come on.

Think he loves her?

She's brain-dead.

- I mean Mickey.
- I dunno.

Tons of guys
get chicks knocked up

and don't get hitched, so...

Dad's super excited.
Planned the whole thing.

Invited his buds
from the gun club.

It's kind of sweet.

no biggie.

Not "people." Just V.

he'll look into transferring me.

Oh, don't get
your panties in a wad.

I know how
to keep my mouth shut.

Look, I'm happy for you.
I'm just sad for me.

is planning this big
camping trip this weekend,

and we're all invited.

You wanna go?

- Yeah! Can we make s'mores?
- Uh-huh.

- And shoot raccoons?
- No.

Interested?

Love camping in theory,
except for the bugs,

and the dirt,
and the ground-sleeping.

But yeah, sounds great.

Mwah.

Well, caffeine addicts await.

Bye-bye, Dr. Jim.

So...

Sighs

you guys know
how Jimmy's thinking about

maybe going back to med school?

- Mm-hmm.
- No.

Okay, well,

if he does,

it would be in Michigan.

He'd leave us?

Or we'd go with him.

Maybe.

To Michigan.
What about school?

Well, it'll only be for a year.

And nothing's decided.

I just want you
to start thinking about it.

What about Frank?
We can't leave him here.

- Of course we can.
- But it's getting cold.

His thick layer of bullshit
will keep him warm.

Cell phone ringing

Laughs Mm.

Hello?

Jimmy's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

Oh, wow, where is it?

How many bathrooms?

A studio?

I will pass that on.

Who was that?

Ann Arbor Rentals.

The application
Jimmy put in went through.

What's a studio?

It's a one-room apartment,
Debs.

I thought you said
it wasn't decided yet.

How are we all
gonna fit in one room?

Door opens

They're here!
They're here!

They're here!

They're here!

Welcome home!
Welcome home!

Look at you, sweet girl!

I'm gonna go grab her stuff.

Look at you.
You look so much better.

Oh, my gosh, the color's
back in your cheeks.

Are you happy to be home?

Yes. I--

This place is nice.
I remember.

Aw...

Hi, Lip.

Hi.

I-I'm, um...

I'm sorry we didn't
install the rails outside.

It's just been so wet.

Um, are you hungry?
I made smoothies.

I'll get you some.

Door opens, closes

Here we go.

What is this?

It's a smoothie.

Slurping

Ahh...

I like the cold on my throat.

And the tongue-taste.

What is this?

Well, it's a smoothie.

- Right.
- Oh.

Inhales

Mm, good night.

What did Dr. Ron
say about this?

She still has
most of her old memories,

she just can't form
any new ones.

Got some pamphlets
from the hospital.

Yeah, thanks.

Um, when's it go away?

Everyone's different, you know?

Could be permanent,
but I say we keep hope alive.

I got family down in Sedona.

They have
healing vortexes out there.

Alternative treatments
and stuff.

Oh, she just got home.

We don't know
what she needs yet.

She seems nicer though.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You left your phone at home.

You didn't have to come down
here to bring it to me.

- You got a weird phone call.
- From who?

Some lady from a--
from a rental place.

She said your credit's
been approved.

You can sign your contract on
your studio whenever you want.

Seems like a tight squeeze.
I mean, all of us in one room.

I filled out that application
form before we talked.

There was hardly anything
available on campus,

and it seemed like
a good opportunity.

So you put a deposit down.

I had to for them
to run the credit check.

On a studio apartment.

Okay, I guess I didn't
think it through.

What, have you signed up
for classes already?

Technically, I'm enrolled,
but it's complicated

- 'cause of my deferral.
- Hey!

Now might be a good time
for a little break-o.

So, you're going,
just like that?

Like I said, nothing's final.

But you had
no plans to bring us.

You've been slowly
backing away all along.

Think about it.

Isn't it so much easier
if I get a place over there

and come home on the weekends?

I mean, why uproot
the entire family?

- I can't even believe this.
- It's a four-hour train ride!

For one year,
it's totally doable!

You made the decision
without me,

as if it has
absolutely no effect on us.

Okay, and how is that
any different from what you did

when you decided to become
legal guardian of those kids?

You never once considered
how I'd be affected.

- Those kids are my life.
- No shit, Fiona.

And maybe if you would've
asked me, I woulda said, "yes.

Let's do this together."
But you didn't.

It didn't even
occur to you to ask me.

No, you have known from day one

what you were
getting into with me.

Right, I got sucked
into your world.

I bent to your rules.

I just assumed
that we'd eventually decide

how to move forward together
like couples do,

but there never was "we!"

What have I been doing?

Cooking, cleaning, laundry,
living in a goddamn slum!

Laughs

A slum?

You made me feel
like I could depend on you,

- and now it's a slum?
- Isn't it?

I got robbed at gunpoint
by a 12-year-old girl, Fiona!

Why don't you go find another
fuckin' place to sleep!

A fucking studio!

Whistles

Ahh. Old cigarettes
and skunk piss.

Here.

- Just crusts?
- That's all they had.

Well, what about breakfast?

Son...

I hope you never have to know

what it's like
to not have a home.

They'll get over it.
At least Fiona will.

I wouldn't count on it.

That ornery bitch
can hold a grudge.

People fuck up.
That's life.

Family is supposed
to be forever.

Supposed to take care of you
regardless of what you do.

That's the whole point,
otherwise why bother?

Christ!
Bangs head

There are vermin in here!

I'm your family.

You're right, son.
You haven't let me down.

When I was your age,

my pop took me
on my first heist.

We scored a hi-fi stereo,
about 600 bucks.

Booked a hotel,

blew all the dough
on room service and porn.

This was back
when you had to pay for it.

Man.
Those were the days.

I haven't thought
about that in years.

My foster gays
have a lot of nice stuff.

Your foster gays?

Cassius and Lanier.

Are you suggesting...

what I think you're suggesting?

- What do they got?
- iPods, computers...

- How often they there?
- They work weekends.

- Can you pick a lock?
- I have their security code.

Is that so?

That's all right.

Rock music



 Well, I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you know,
I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you don't forget,
oh, such a spin

 the meanest shake
that I could have ever been

 you know
that I'm struggling

 to pick myself
off the floor

 you know
that I'm struggling

Rise and shine.
We're going camping.

Pack some warm clothes, okay?

Gets cold by the lake at night.

Did you talk to Jimmy
about the studio yet?

No. Let's go.

Knocks on door

Good morning.

Let's go. Up and at 'em.



Good morning, milk dud!

Hey! Hi!
We're going camping!

You want to go camping?
It's so fun.

There's playing,
and singing, and kids.

And there's dirt.
Oh, you love dirt!

Can I do your ears,
or do you still hate that?

My ears.

Where's Jody?

He's at the Wongs',
picking up Hymie.

Do you remember Hymie?

I remember.
The Asian mongoloid.

Actually,
we can call him a retard.

We've earned that right.

Do you want to
spend time with him?

Yes.

Oh, that's wonderful.

He is so special.

You know, I saw this movie
the other day

about babies around the world.

Do you know
that mothers in Africa

wipe their babies' dirty bottoms
on their knees?

- Where's Jody?
- At the Wongs'.

And then they use leaves
to scrape the poop off.

I mean, why not just use
the leaves in the first place?

I don't understand
why they're not

sick all the time over there
with all that bacteria.

Bacteria.

I'm hungry.

I'll make sandwiches
after this.

Where's Jody?

I understand.

Knock on door
Both: Gasp

- Jody.
- Aww.

It's cool, mom, I got this.

Both: Giggle

Okay, we ready?

I can't find the flashlights.

Check the closets.

Yeah, I did, like, three times.

- Where's Carl?
- Said he's not going.

He doesn't feel well.

Oh, you look like garbage.

You sick?

No temperature.

Should we stay home?

- No, I'm not that sick.
- No, no, no, please...

Can we still go?
Liam will be so sad.

Sighs

Okay, but stay in bed.
Drink fluids.

Hey, can you hold him
for a second?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Get my coat on.

Okay.
Enjoy the wedding.

I can't wait
to hear the reports.

Bottles jingle

Jesus, Ian.

What time did you
get in last night?

- 3:00.
- Where were ya?

Out.
Burps

- Ew, gross!
- Okay.

Come on, upstairs.
Sleep it off.

Exhales

Sighs
Will someone please tell me

what the hell is going on
with that kid?

I'm sure he'll tell you
when he's ready.

I hope so.

- Okay, we are off.
- Okay.

Bye.

Bye, Debs.

- Bye!
- Bye!

Bye!

Nurture nature!

We haven't had sex
in over a week.

Yeah, I've, uh...

been a little distracted.

What the fuck?!

- Whatever you do...
- Hey--

Whatever you do...

do not...
do not...

let her bone you.

Hey--
Grunting

You belong here...

with me.

Not with that
fucking vegetable.

Aah!

Panting

Hey, man,
thanks for letting me crash.

Well, you just sorta
showed up, so...

What time did we
crap out last night?

I was in bed by 11:00.

You must have
passed out after 3:00,

'cause that's the last time
I heard the bathroom door slam.

Time five out of five,
each time louder than the last.

Hmm.

I'm-- I'm sorry, man.
I'm a mess.

- I got in this huge fight with--
- With your girlfriend.

We talked about it
for two hours straight.

Oh. Uh, hey,
what time is it?

1:30. I gotta split.
I'm on, uh, afternoon rotation.

You may as well finish that.

This door locks behind you
if you pull it hard,

- which you're awesome at, so...
- Okay.

Exhales

Cell phone beeps

Hey, uh, Kev, it's Lip.

Um...

look, I fucked up.
I, um--

I let her bone me. Just--
Footsteps approaching

call me back as soon
as you get this, all right?

- You okay in there?
- Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah, I'm just, uh,
a little backed up.

For 45 minutes?

Yup.

- Can I get you anything?
- No, please.

I'm-- I'm great. Okay?
I'm fine. Thank you.

I-I-I hate my dress.

I look like a drag queen.

You think Fiona would mind

- if I borrowed one of hers?
- Yes.

- She'd mind, or she'd let me?
- Mind!

Jesus!
Barge right in, why don't you?

What's going on?

I've got a lot
of stuff on my mind.

And you can't
talk to me about it?

No.

What time are you
gonna come tonight?

I don't know, late.
I got some shit I gotta do.

At Karen's?

Errands.

You know what?
Don't bother coming.

Have Nots' All Or None

 Never wanted nothing
other than

 to sing along with you all

 living under the radar

 but now we're
cleaning up the rubble

 from all the shit
we never wanted

 it's the pride in a life that
we never wanted to amount to

 and turned us into

 an indebted and indentured
servant to the human race

 force fed inherited
everything we couldn't take



Work it, Gallagher!
That's right, own that sack!

- Whoo!
- Hey!

What?
How long have you been here?

- Hi. Couple hours.
- Yeah?

Where you been?

Uh, I had to do a meat run.

Yeah, somebody accidentally
left the beef cooler

sitting on the driveway,
and by "someone," I mean me.

- Laughs
- You having fun?

It's my fourth.

Oh, very ni--
I will take that as a yes.

- Where's your peeps?
- Uh...

little redhead
is my sister Debbie,

and the little, brown baby
with the boogers

is my brother Liam.

Laughs
Nice, nice. Is that it?

Uh, yeah,
my brother Carl's sick,

my brother Ian has a hangover,

and my other brother Lip
had that wedding.

Gotcha, gotcha.

Where's your man?

Laughs Is that cup a perk?

Or did you
have to pay for that?

Hey, don't hate
'cause I get swag.

- Ah...
- Okay? I'm a full-timer.

Mm-hmm.

If you weren't
moving to Michigan,

- maybe you'd pull cups too.
- Well, shit.

How can I go now knowing that?

Well, shit,
I don't think you can.

Cheers.
Chuckles

Hey. Hop in.

I'll give you a ride.

Nando! Hey, wow!
When did you get here?

Early.

You f--

flew all the way from Brazil?

Miami.

I was there on business.

I'm ravenous.
We go eat?

from the big, big hill

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

You call me a punk for wanting
a boyfriend or whatever,

but you're gonna marry someone
who screws guys for a living?

Who gives a shit?

It's a fucking piece of paper.

Not to me.

Scoffs

Hey, come on-- look.

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean
we can't still bang.

Okay?

All right?

If you give half a shit
about me, Mickey--

Hey, hey.

Half.

Don't do this.

And these stairs
lead to the side room,

and this is the hallway
to the bedroom.

This is the outside deck.

The living room, the kitchen,

the other bedroom,
and the front room.

My God, how big is this place?

- Big.
- Bastards.

There's no more marshmallows.

I hate that.

They give you, like,
ten in the whole bag.

- What if they catch us?
- Visualize success.

What if they dust
for fingerprints?

Always wear gloves.
Got one. Chuckles

It's a treasure chest.
That's a good omen.

What about DNA testing?

Nobody bothers with that
CSIcrap, not on a burglary.

Cops'll see these faggots,
they won't give three wet farts.

Are you with me?

Hmm.

Okay, one, two, three, go.

Eh, we'll get it next time.

Mmm.

You haven't taken
one bite, Steve.

All this food going to waste.

Mmm.

Now, tell me...

I hear reports of, um,
medical school.

Uh, going back in January.

I'm gonna become
a dermatologist or a surgeon.

Good.

Cosmetic surgery's
a rich field.

Very lucrative.
Much potential.

Indeed.

And this would require
a move to another state.

Only temporary. I'm-- I'm still
working out the details.

You know,
I-I really just want to do

what's best for everyone.

Well, it sounds like
you want to do

what's best for yourself.

Uh, but having a doctor
husband for Estefania

would be a great thing.

You know, in America,
doctors are seen as heroes.

I'm familiar with your culture.

But the point
being is it's--

it's all good, you know?
Ann Arbor's a great town.

There's lots of shops.

Mm.

And when was the last time
you've seen my daughter?

Uh, two days ago.

Why?

I saw her three hours ago.

In INS Holding.

I suppose you're not aware
she's being deported.

Wait, why? Why--

You missed an INS visit
yesterday, Steve.

Why didn't she call me?

Well, she tried.
You didn't pick up.

And she failed to impress
the authorities.

Didn't even know your birthday.

My birthday is Christmas!
How hard is that to remember?

And your mother's name.

This is my fault?
We did-- we did flash cards.

I can't be with her
every second.

Sighs I ask
so little of you, Steve.

So little.

Stay out of trouble.

Be attentive to my daughter.

Her presence in this country
is controversial.

You understand that.

We were under a microscope.
I thought I made that clear.

Look, I'm so sorry
this happened,

I just don't know what could've
been done to prevent it.

That's precisely
the problem, isn't it, Steve?

What now?

Well, what's done
cannot be undone.

Now I must grease many palms.

It will be dealt with.

People cheering, chattering

Wait, so you're telling me

you've never
been to a strip club?

No. Just the thought
of a lap dance

actually makes me woozy.

- Laughs
- Like, do I grope?

If-- how do I go about doing that
in, like, a non-offensive way?

Like, do I make eye contact,
or is that--

that could be insulting,
'cause I mean,

she works so hard on her body.

Wow, you really are
a gentleman.

I am hardly a gentleman.

I just have a problem
with forced intimacy.

Blame my mother.

Your mom was a stripper?

Mm-hmm.
Laughs

Still a stripper, by the way.

Clears throat 90 years old.

Takes her like 40 minutes
to unhook her bra,

but when she does, what a show.

Laughs

So, uh...

we sorta ditched the party.

Yeah, we sorta did.

I'm gonna make
three assumptions.

Fire away.

Okay, one,
you're as drunk as I am.

- Correct. Shh.
- Laughs

Two, you're as cold as I am.

Colder. Less padding.

I'm gonna ignore that.

- Sighs
- Three...

you're a gentleman.

False.

Quite the opposite.

Hmm.

Well, then you better
behave yourself,

because I am way too drunk
not to invite you

back to my tent right now.

God damn, Gallagher.

I oughta get you
pissed off more often.

So, what are we gonna do?

We gonna
tell everyone to leave?

Nah.

I'll go get
this shit over with,

and, uh, you can
wait here for me.

Shouldn't take
more than an hour, right?

You better be ready
for round two.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Why are you acting
like I got a choice in this?

This is bullshit.

Listen to me, Mickey.

Your dad is an evil,
psychotic prick.

You're just gonna
let him ruin your life?

You need to grow the fuck up.

Don't act like you know
a thing about my dad.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Not everybody
gets to just--

not everybody just gets to

blurt out how they fuckin' feel
every minute.

Footsteps approaching

Everyone's looking for you.

I'm having a fuckin' smoke.
Is that all right?

You just get here?

Yeah.

I didn't know you were coming.

Last-minute decision.

Come on.

Ah!

What, what?
You okay?

What am I doing?
What am I doing?

Do you want to stop?
We can stop.

- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

We got carried away, all right?
These things happen.

I don't know what I'm doing.

You're using me for revenge.

Am I?

I'm not saying that I mind.
I-I-I do not mind.

I just recognize the impulse.

He was planning on
going to Michigan without me.

Oh, shit.

He acted like he was
gonna take all of us,

the first time that he's lied.

I closed my stupid eyes to it

to work so bad.

Your eyes aren't stupid.

Sighs Oh, I'm an idiot.

someone dumps on you

does not mean you deserve it.

Tell me that

Ex-wife. God.

her name wasn't "Ocksucker."

Both: Laugh

When she started
going to the gym every day.

Sighs You?

Hey, let's celebrate.

Go cook us up some spaghettios.

Lis-- listen, I know
that I got sloppy, Nando,

but I will fix it.
Just tell me what I can do.

Run-- run drugs,
steal cars,

you know, my dad has connections
in the government.

He's a powerful man.

He supported
immigration legislation--

So much traffic today.
Are the cubs playing?

It's-- you know what?

It's a good thing
this happened, actually.

I mean, not entirely,
of course,

but I-I'm completely clear
on the rules.

You know, I'm absolutely
on the same page as you.

I mean, thank you for that.
Truly. Truly.

Oh, let's go see who that is.

Oh, hey!

I'm just finishing up
Karen's favorite snack.

Snickerdoodle cupcakes.

She's upstairs.

Um, but hey, um, you don't need

to install the motion lights

because Jody is taking
Karen and Hymie to Sedona

to live near
the vortexes, so...

It's fine.
They're gonna be near family.

And she is his wife, after all.

Is-- is Mrs. Wong
okay with Hymie leaving?

Well, she's his mother,

and babies belong
with their mothers, so...

You go on up.
I'll be right there with snacks.

Chuckles

Hey.

How you feeling?

Exhales

Your mom says you're moving.

I am?

Yeah, to Arizona?

Oh.

The Grand Canyon.

Cactuses.

Right.

Hey...

I know you're in there.
It's just us now, okay?

We can talk.

Hey, uh...

you remember that day

we, uh-- we got drunk

and, uh,
ran around Lincoln Park

setting off all the alarms
on the Priuses?

Yeah.

And then we, um--

we climbed the Lincoln statue

and gave Old Abe some, uh,
lipstick with red sharpie.

Yeah... yeah.

Yeah, you were, uh,
fucking fearless.

And a total shithead.

I remember, um, you made me
go down on you that night

in the bathroom of Bennigan's.

You remember all that?

Yes.

But...

I can't feel.

Feel what?

Stuff.

Inside.

I, uh...

I don't know what that means.

I can't explain.

But...

it's okay.

Are there snacks?

Mandy.
Mandy did this. Okay?

Mandy hit you with the car
and fucked you up forever!

All right?
Because of me.

Mandy Milkovich.

Yes.

Do you understand me?

- Yes.
- Okay.

Do you know who hit you?

No.

Are there snacks?

 Lady in red

People chattering

 there's nobody here

Mandy!

Come here.

Laughs
Couldn't stay away, could you?

You ruined Karen's life!

You're a jealous,
demented cunt, Mandy!

Seriously!

All right? We're done!

I did it for you, you prick.

I did everything for you,
but you're so fucking blind.

You know what, don't sweat it.

We were done
before you got here.

This is Kenyatta.

He's my date.

I just swallowed his load
in the bathroom.

Can you taste it?

He did it.

He got married.
To a woman.

I told you
not to come here, okay?

You try sitting on your ass
while the person you love--

No, I'm sorry, I mean
the guy you've been fucking

gets married
to some random commie skank!

Fuckin' commie!

 You were amazing

 never seen
so many people--

Let's go.

Get out of the car.

Okay.

one phone call to Fiona?

Please?

Cell phone splashes Fuck.

Engine growling

I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

Ian, hey, stop.
No! We're here!

I'm gonna puke.

Police radios

We know you've been stealing...

Fuck.

- Kid, settle down.
- Hey, whoa, can I help you?

Who are you?

I'm his brother.
What's going on?

We have reason
to believe this child

may have robbed
his former foster parents

while they were
at work this afternoon.

Yeah?
What proof you got?

He had a special security code
assigned to him.

He's the only one
that knows it.

All right, as far as I can
tell, that's not evidence.

Get your fuckin'
hands off him, man.

His code was a series
of four letters.

C-A-R-L.

Take your fuckin' hands
off him, man!

He's just a fucking kid!

All right,
that's enough of that.

Step back, sir.

Take your hands
off the officer right now!

Step away from the officer.

It's gonna be okay.

This kid stole
from people, all right?

- We're taking him in.
- You're ta-- he's a fucking kid!

Do not touch the officer.

- Step back right now!
- Carl, come here!

If you interfere again,
I will arrest you!

Do not touch him!

Why are you being
so rough with him?

You are gonna have to--

Why is he being
so fucking rough with him?

You touch him again,
I will arrest you!

Whoa, whoa.
Good evening, gentlemen.

- Are you the parent?
- Why, yes, I am.

What the fuck
are you doing here, Frank?

I'm coming home.

We're taking your son
in for questioning.

He didn't do the heist, I did.

You see?
Shiny, but a little bit big.

I also got a boatload
of electronics-- those sold fast.

Did you know that Chicago
has several 24-hour pawn shops?

He-- he didn't--
he's innocent.

I forced him
to give me the code.

Didn't I?
Son, tell 'em.

Oh, my God.
He's dumber than a bag of hair.

He couldn't pull off a band-aid,
much less a robbery.

Okay, here.

Baby squeals

Hey, you got an extra
one of those?

- You're gonna be late!
- Got nothing to wear.

Gonna see what V has.

Is your new job
at a strip club?

- Ha, ha.
- I wasn't kidding.

It's a temp office job,
so I don't know

how long the day's gonna be.

I expect all of you
to help Jimmy with dinner

and get your homework done
and generally avoid

setting the house on fire.

Overcompensating.

She feels guilty for
turning us into latchkey kids.

What's a latchkey kid?

Hey.

I left some stuff here
that I need.

Is it wrong if I just
leave for school?

Later.

Baby babbles

- All right.
- Squeals

Grunts

Upbeat music



Belches

Laughs



Both laughing

Laughing

- What's funny?
- Garfield.

He's always so hungry.

Laughs

What are you reading about?

A bunch of uppity queers
claiming that

domestic partnership rights
are not good enough for them.

They get offended when
you call them queers, Frank.

Calling people
by their name is not,

nor should it ever,
be argued as offensive.

God almighty.

- You okay?
- No!

I'm a pauper, and somehow
I got the king's disease.

Gonorrhea?

Kings don't screw whores.

They screw virgins
or their nieces.

The king's disease is gout.

Big toe is throbbing
like blue balls

that no blowjob can ever fix.

You got any Percs or Vikes?

No, but I could call my doctor,

see if she can fit you in.

She's super nice.
Korean. Small fingers.

No, thank you.
Doctors are crooks,

especially the Korean ones.

Never trust a culture
that makes sausages from dogs.

Frank, I'm pretty sure
that's racist.

Accurate is not racist.

Write that down
in your AA journal.

Hold on.
You work for the city.

- Yeah.
- We live together.

You cook for me,
clean for me, shop for me.

That makes us family.

Oh, Frank, I'm touched.

We qualify for domestic
partnership rights.

I can use your insurance,
go to the lady doctor

with the small fingers
for free.

No. No, no.

Those laws do not apply to us.

Why not?

Why should our heterosexual
proclivities

prevent us
from collecting our due?

That is heterophobia,
and I won't stand for it.

You won't?

The squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

Write that down, Christopher.

You mean everything you said?

No.

Well, how much of it
did you mean?

I don't know-- I mean,
I meant a little bit of it.

You know, I think
there's some things that

we could stand to talk about,
but mostly, I just--

Was in douche land?

Not my choice of words, but--

Why does Karen Jackson
still have pictures of you

on her Facebook page?

I have no fucking idea.

Well, if there's nothing going
on between the two of you--

- Mandy, I don't go
on to Facebook, okay?

'Cause I don't give a shit
about whose pet just died

or who just checked in
at the fucking McDonald's.

She's a skanky,
manipulative bitch.

You should un-friend her.

Also, you have an appointment
this afternoon

with the alumni rep from MIT.

It's 3:30 here.

- What?
- It's a good thing.

It means you got past
the first round.

Yeah. No, no, no.
I know that.

But, um, I never applied
for MIT.

Yeah, you did.
Also Carnegie Mellon,

Northwestern, Columbia,
Stanford, and Penn.

Come on, I can't be late today.

Whoa, wait. Hang on.

You applied
to all those schools for me?

A few fallbacks, too,
just in case.

No, no. Wait.

This is perfect.
Where did you get this?

I used to do the sexy
librarian thing--

glasses, hair bun,
the whole bit.

But you need hose.
Those offices pump in the AC.

Oh, nah. I'm warm-blooded.
I'll be good.

Kev, do guys get PMS?

Are you asking me if I bleed
from my nuts once a month?

I'm asking if guys get their
own version of--

I don't know,
hormonal bullshit.

- Nope.
- Yes, he does.

- Do not.
- Remember when you broke

the TV remote last month
for no good reason?

It wouldn't fucking work.
That's a good reason.

We get weepy.
They get angry.

Jimmy doesn't
seem angry exactly.

- He seems quiet.
- Oh, God. Stop.

Would you stop right there?

We get quiet for one minute,
and you guys

think that we're obsessing
about the relationship.

And all we're thinking is,
"I wonder if

there's any more cheese."

You mean we make you smarter
than you are?

No, no, no.

You make us more interested
in you than we are.

Oh, don't mind him.

He's just mad 'cause somebody
cut off the tip of his penis

when he was too young
to defend himself.

V, don't start that shit!

What are we talking about?

Whether or not
to circumcise our baby.

- Are you-- wait. Is your mom--
- No, no one's pregnant.

And if somebody were pregnant,

it still may not even be a boy.

- But if it is a boy--
- If it is a boy,

you gotta circumcise.

I mean, have you ever
seen one that's uncut?

You don't know
what's going on up in there.

It does not make you
want to go downtown.

And you want your kid
to get his share of head, right?

Thank you!

Or not? Crap. Sorry.

Thanks for the suit.
Gotta go.

Bye. Love you. Okay.

Door shuts

Knock at door

- Morning.
- Morning, Jody.

Fiona said you guys
were gonna watch Liam today?

Uh, I gotta work.

But it'll be good
for Sheila to watch him.

Sheila, Debbie's here.

I gotta go, babe. Sit up.

Sitting up's a real good start.

I, uh-- I gotta go.

Sheila, are you okay?

I'm fine.

Of course, I'm-- I'm fine.

Fiona said you were gonna
watch Liam today.

Yes, that's fine.

It'll be nice to have a baby.

Good morning, mom.

Sighs

- Hi, Karen.
- Hey.

Have you had any breakfast?

Sobbing

- Snaps fingers
- Yo, chief.

I asked for
a bone-dry cappuccino.

This isn't bone-dry.

Oh, so you're talking about,
like,

the kind of bone that's been
left out in the sun?

'Cause living bones
are 35% water,

and they bleed
when you break them.

Are you freaking kidding me?

No, not you, man. Sorry.

Coffee shop boy
is giving me lip. Hang on.

Dude, when I spend as much
for a cup of coffee

as a gallon of gas,
I get it how I want it.

Remake it bone-dry, dirt-dry,
fucking desert-dry, okay?

- Do it now!
- Very sorry, sir.

We'll take care of that
right away.

Just do it.

I don't understand.
You really don't get

- why I have a problem with this?
- No.

- Really?
- No!

Ian, do you get
why I have a problem with this?

Not getting in the middle.

Why are you being
such a dick about this?

Those applications
are 90 pages long.

It took me forever
to fill them out.

Walk the fuck away.

- Wow. You're--
- What? I'm what?

You're not my mother.

You're not in charge
of who I talk to

or who has a picture of me
on Facebook.

And you're sure as shit
not in charge

of if I go to college!

You think he's right?

Men are never right.

That's why women were invented,

to think for you assholes.

I mean, look at Mickey, marrying
some whore he knocked up.

What?

Men are weak and stupid,
even the good ones.

I mean, especially
the good ones.

And I'm not gonna
watch Lip fuck up his life

the way that Mickey's
fucking up his.

School bell chimes

Hey, Sheila, I made you some
cinnamon toast and coffee.

Cinnamon toast and coffee
always makes me

feel a little better
when I'm down.

It's just, you have to sit up
to eat it.

- Sobs
- Come on, Sheila.

Sit up.
You'll feel better, I promise.

Sobs

You the temp?

Yeah, hi. Yes.
Fiona Gallagher.

Nice to meet you, Fiona.
I'm Connie.

We're all
on a first-name basis here.

It's a family-run company,
real friendly place.

- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Follow me.

You'll be covering for Maria.

She's a cold caller
in our marketing department.

And last week, Friday,
she was having cramps,

but it wasn't
her time of the month.

And I told her not to ignore it,
but did she listen?

Appendicitis. She barely
made it there in time.

Honest, it was about to burst.
And then who knows?

- Wow, that's--
- Yeah, so, if you're

having cramps
on your left side,

and it's not
your time of the month,

you shouldn't ignore it,
or you could very well die.

- That's good to know.
- Isn't it?

You can drop your bag there,
and I'll show you around.

- Okay.
- That's the copy room,

the warehouse, the kitchen,
treadmill, water cooler.

That's the fridge.
Anything with a label on it

belongs to somebody else,
except for the yogurts.

Margie never labels them
because everyone

just knows she's always
on a diet.

So if you know
what's good for you--

Stay away from the yogurt.
Got it.

But the donuts on the table
are fair game.

Fair game as in free?

We all take turns buying a box.

But you're a temp,
so you can just have one.

That's the bathroom,
women's room.

Once you get settled in,

you'll be making calls
from this list.

And you'll read
from this script.

It's real simple.
You'll start here.

And if they say this,
you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

You get the idea?

You're calling customers
who haven't

placed an order for a while.

So if you get a bite,
you transfer them

straight away to sales
by pressing this button.

They'll close the deal.

So, uh, I'm the fluffer
and they're the happy ending?

I'm sorry, uh--

I have a lot of brothers.

All right.

I'll be over there,
if you have any questions.

Sighs

What do you mean,
living together for a year?

What kind of a rule is that?

We call that rule a law.

Well, it just so happens,
I was mistaken.

Christopher and I have been
living together

for a year, well over a year.

Sir, if you just
let me explain--

And just because my name
isn't on the utility bill,

that is no reason to deny me
my basic civil rights.

Sir, I'm just trying
to explain to you what we have--

My partner has been
working hard killing dogs

for this city
for close to a decade.

- You kill dogs?
- Animal control.

I know my rights.

Sir, I cannot award you
domestic partnership status

unless you have proof
that you are and have been

financially and emotionally
interdependent partners

for over a year.

Joint tenancy documents
verifying--

- I know my rights.

Do you not understand
that I get 150 of you people

in here a day spouting
this same shit at me?

"You people"? What can
that mean, "you people"?

- Oh, no, we're not like that.
- You're not like what?

We are not the kind of people
you can push around

with your homophobic rhetoric.

Where are you going?
I'm still talking!

I'm going on break.

That's my civil right!

Fucking-- let's go.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

We've noticed that you haven't
renewed your order in a while.

And I was wondering
if I could transfer you

to our sales dep--

Oh, no? Huh.

Well, that's really shitty.

Yeah, no, I get it.

I had a mailman at home
like that, a real seedy dude.

It looked like he was
casing the joint

every time he dropped off
a package.

I got so fed up,
that I called the post office

and, you know, I had them
take him off my route.

Now we have this great lady,
Josephine, really nice.

I bet if you call and complain,
they'll switch him out for you.

But either way,
they'll want to hear about it.

Great. Yes,
I will transfer you now.

Good luck.

Clears throat

Hey. They had a rude
delivery guy, so I--

I heard. It's just--
if they say this, you say this.

If they say this, you say this.

- You stick to the script.
- I got it.

Sorry. It won't happen again.

Okay.

Cell phone ringing

Hello?

What?

Oh, yes, Debbie is home sick
from school today.

Thank you.

Sighs

Are you ready?

Yeah, I'm just not into
this setup.

- I look weak.
- It's gimp porn, babe.

You're supposed to look weak.

Am I also supposed to look fat?

Jeez, you sound like a woman.

Maybe it's because someone
cut off part of your manhood

when you were too young
to defend yourself.

I just don't want to do
the gimp thing.

Do you know how expensive
a kid is, Kev?

Sack it up.

Phone ringing

Hey, Fi.

Hey, can you pop over
to the house

and see if Debbie's there?

I don't know
if she's really sick

or if she's skipping or what.

All right,
I'll go check on her.

But you have to go
to www.dontcutitoff.org

- What?
- I'm serious, Fiona.

Go to that website
and see if you stand by your

"I want my son to get
his share of head" argument.

Do not do it, Fiona.

dontcutitoff.org, promise.
Promise!

- Okay. Okay, okay. I'll do it.
- All right, bye.

Hi, this is Fiona
from Worldwide Cup.

Vote Paul Lashmet
for a better Chicago.

Hope I can count on your vote.

Nice to meet you.

Baby cries

Can't you shut the baby up?

I could shove her up your ass
and see if that does it.

You need to learn respect
for your elders.

You need to learn
to not be a total dickwad.

I have a plan to put Chicago
back to work.

Hey. Hey. Over here.

I know you can hear me,
Mr. Give-Me-Your-Vote!

You want to know
what's wrong with this city?

You want
to know what doesn't work?

My wife and I got married
after three weeks of dating,

and she turned out to be
a bipolar drug addict-- easy--

who left me alone
with six kids to raise,

while my domestic partner,

Mr. Christopher Collier,
is a clean and sober,

hardworking citizen
of this country.

I think he deserves
the same rights

as a woman who would
abandon her children.

Thank you, sir. And I will
consider your situation.

Don't you turn your back on me.

- Oh, don't you worry.
- I'm a citizen of this country.

I live in this city.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits.

Which means for me,
it's stand in the line

at the free clinic or suffer.

That's not only unfair
and unchristian,

it's flat out un-American.

I'm a citizen.

Where are my equal rights?

Fix that,
Mr. I-Want-To-Be-Mayor.

Fuck.

Thank you so much.

I'll transfer you now.

Cell phone chimes

Sighs _

I like this color.

Kind of cheers you up
just looking at it, right?

It does.

Sometimes when
you're feeling really bad,

if you make yourself
look better on the outside,

it can start to make you
feel better on the inside.

My mom calls it,
"taking it from the outside in."

Phone ringing

Mumbles

Phone ringing

Jackson residence.

Debbie, you were just supposed
to drop Liam there.

Why aren't you at school?
Are you sick?

Uh, code pink.

- Monica's home?
- No, no, no.

Code pink at Sheila's.

- I'll explain later, okay?
- Fine, explain later.

But you're in big trouble.

Sighs

What's a code pink?

It's nothing.

I was just trying
to explain to Fiona

why I'm not at school.

It's like a code word we have.

Oh, no. What time is it?

Are you skipping school
because of me?

I didn't want to go anyway.

All anyone ever does
is try to copy off me.

But no one wants
to sit with me at lunch.

Everybody's mean.
Middle school's stupid.

Mean girls suck.

My daughter's a mean girl.

I don't know how it happened.

It's not your fault.

But I'm her mother.

If how we turn out
is all about how our mother is,

then I'm pretty screwed, right?

Both moaning

Laughing

- What's funny?
- It's just--

she applied to colleges for you.

Wow, I'm so glad my cock
thrust up inside of you

is holding your attention
so well.

That's really nice for me.

Sorry, I just--
I don't get it.

Why don't you just dump her?

Less talking, more riding.

Both moaning

Is Mickey seriously
getting married?

Yeah. Like,
in a couple of weeks.

Jesus. To who?

I-I didn't even know
he was seeing anyone.

Well, I don't think
he was seeing her

so much as he was doing her.

- So why's he marrying her?
- She's knocked up.

So? I don't get it.

What, is your dad making him?

I don't know.

Why do you give a shit?

Indistinct chatter

Sighs

Don't you turn your back on me.

I'm a citizen of this country.

My partner works for this city.

But because we're not married,

which the law doesn't even
allow, I might add,

I am not allowed to share
in his insurance benefits,

which means for me,
it's stand in line

That's not only unfair
and unchristian...

- Holy shit.
- It's flat out un-American.

- Frank?
- You know him?

Where are my equal rights?

You could say that.
He's my dad.

I-- wow, that speech.

Your father-- I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.

Oh, my God, I wish
I could turn back time.

Turn back time? Why?

Some of the office bitches
may have narc-ed on you

about the porn at your desk
and the personal phone calls.

And by office bitches,
I might mean myself.

Porn at my desk?

Oh, shit.

Fiona. Hi.

So Mr. Pratt is asking
for a word with you.

- Let me guess. He's the boss?
- No, no.

He's one of the cousins.

Not the big boss,
but he is a supervisor, yes.

Really, very sorry.

Knock at door Yes?

Hi. Fiona Gallagher.

The temp?

Oh, Fiona, yeah.

Um, go ahead and have a seat.

Go ahead, sorry.

So I've had some complaints
about your language,

a few personal calls
on company time--

- I have five kids.

They're my siblings,
but I raise them.

And one of them skipped school.

So I'm sorry
about the personal calls,

but it was really
only a couple minutes.

And I'm happy to clock out early
and work late.

Oh, no.
You don't have to do that.

There were some photos.

Yeah, the porn at my desk?

It wasn't really porn.

It was pictures of penises,

but it was
from a circumcision website.

See, friends of mine
are trying for a baby.

And I had said a thing about
how they should

circumcise the baby so that
girls will be more likely

to want to--
uh, with their mouths.

Not on the baby, of course.

I mean once he's a grown-up.

Shit.

Am I fired?

No, you're-- Clears throat
Sorry.

My silence here is not
so much about disapproval

as it is trying to find a way

to participate
in this conversation

that won't leave me vulnerable
to a lawsuit,

'cause I would like to say that
I am a little shocked

to learn that, um, circumcision,
or a lack thereof,

would affect a woman's
willingness to--

Clears throat

I can't say that.

I can't say anything, really.

I've said too much already.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't sue me.

I'm so sorry.
Please don't fire me.

Deal. But, hey,
I'm putting my foot down.

No more naked body parts
at your desk for any reason.

Both laugh
Shit. Sorry.

And watch your language,
like you're in church.

- Got it.
- And also,

you're doing a great job.

Scoffs I'm what?

I got a call from
one of our sales reps.

You apparently convinced
a high-volume customer

that we thought
we'd lost to re-up.

Something about a delivery man?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Well, anyway, great work.
And keep it up.

Do me a favor.
Don't go out there smiling.

You'll help me maintain
that reputation as a hard-ass.

You have a reputation
as a hard-ass?

No.

I really want one, though.

Laughs
Hey. Mm-mm.

_

- What's this?
- Payday.

Oh, sweet!

It's $218.

I worked 40 hours
at $10 an hour.

That's $400.

Yeah, minus taxes.

Oh, and minus the free refills

you've been giving your
little boyfriend over there.

My what? No, that's my--
I barely know him.

He's here when you're here
and he's not when you're not.

And you give him free refills.

You think I don't see?
I see.

Phillip?

Scott Walker, MIT Alumni Rep.

We had an appointment at 3:30.
It's nearly 4:00.

Right, yeah. Look,
I'm sorry you came and waited,

but I'm not interested.

You're not interested in MIT?

- No.
- Oh, that's too bad.

I was really curious
to interview the kid

with the 4.6 GPA
who so blatantly

plagiarized
his application essay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
I didn't plagiarize anything.

She plagiarized Nelson Mandela.
Jesus.

She?

Yeah, my girlfriend
wrote this application.

I'm guessing she Googled
"good speeches" and

picked one that sounded
smartest to her.

I'm surprised she didn't
go with "I have a dream."

Well, you sure you
don't want to do the interview?

- I'm already here.
- No, thanks.

- I hate Boston. Red Sox suck.
- Okay.

It's unlikely you could have
gotten in anyway.

Laughs

What is that,
reverse psychology?

Let me guess,
you minored in psych,

thinking it would give you a leg
up in business negotiations.

You may have a 4.6,
but you also required

a three semester senior year
due to truancy.

And competition is pretty
intense if you require

a full scholarship,
which I'm guessing that you do.

Wow, why don't you
just go ahead

and call me white trash
while you're at it?

Competition's tougher
at this level, that's all.

At this level. Jesus.
Give me a fucking pen.

Frank.

Frank. Frank, why?

Why would you? Why?
Sighs

My coworkers teased me so much

I had to pretend
that I was sick.

Then my mother called.

She almost had a cardiac episode
she was so upset.

I only convinced her last year
that I'm not gay.

It took me years, Frank, years.

Why would you do this?

Why, Frank, why?

The fuck are you talking about?

You told the world we're gay!

It's all over Twitter.

It's all over Facebook.

It was on the 12:00 news.

What?

You're famous
for being gay, Frank.

Are you gay?
Are you, really?

Phone ringing

I am whatever I need to be
at the time I need to be it.

No, mom, I am not-- mom.

Dude, I'm telling you,
this is my car.

- It has a kid's seat in it.
- I don't give a shit.

Look at that chip
right there, man.

That diamond-shaped scratch,
I did that the night

we had too many Jaeger bombs.
Remember?

Hell, I still
got the keys, man.

Both laugh

I found my stolen car, bitch.

Well, what are you waiting
for? Call the cops.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you. Sorry.

Passing by,
couldn't help but overhear.

I'd just take it home.

Cops keep it in evidence for,
like, a year.

- You're right.
- Yeah.

He's right, man. Plus,
insurance already covered it,

so this is, like,
found money, bitch.

Why is that man
driving your car?

- Because it's stolen.
- You let him steal it?

No, Beto. I stole it,

back when life was fun
and the world had meaning.

You gonna punish me for it?

You want to break
another finger?

How about a toe?

Maybe cut off
a couple earlobes?

Stick a fork in my eye?

Cheers and applause

Saw you on the news, Frank.

- About time you came out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Have your fun.
Just pour me a goddamn drink.

Don't do it, Kate.
We don't need

- his AIDS germs in here.
- Screw you, Tommy.

- You wish.
- Are you really gay now, Frank?

What is gay, Kermit?
Gay is a state of mind.

It is a mood.

Gay is when you part
the ass cheeks of another man

and use your dick
as a divining rod.

Well, by that definition, no,
then I'm not gay.

Then what are you doing
going on the news,

talking about gay rights?

I was trying to get
insurance coverage.

Hey, Frank, how do you fit
three homos on a barstool?

You turn it upside down!

Laughter

Kate, I leave it to you
to rise above

this homophobic rhetoric

and offer me recompense
in the form of whiskey.

It's only homophobia
when they're afraid of you.

I'm pretty sure
they just don't like you.

Come on, just give me
a drink anyway--

- You maxed out your tab, Frank.
- Hey.

What does one gay say to another
one going on vacation?

"Can I help you
pack your shit?"

Laughter

Kermit, that joke is so
hackneyed, you owe me a drink.

a refrigerator and a fag?

The fridge doesn't fart
when you pull the meat out!

Laughter

All: Oh, no.

Clears throat

Your insipid essay question
asks me to tell you

in 250 words about my most
significant challenge in life.

Honestly,
it's hard to pick one.

My guess is that
you want to hear about

my alcoholic father and
my runaway mom or maybe about--

You would eat that shit up.

But those aren't
my greatest challenges in life.

An education system that
pretends to be a meritocracy--

What would you want to study
at MIT?

Provided you could get past
my well-meaning oblivion

and the proximity
of the Red Sox.

Robotics.

But none of that undergrad
filler bullshit.

No 200-seat lectures
taught by TAS.

I just want the shit
out in front of me.

The shit?

Yeah, the tools, you know,
the toys,

the stuff I can't get access
to in my ghetto high school.

Why?

Because I'd like to hang out
with C-3PO in my lifetime.

And at the rate you're going,
that shit's not gonna happen.

I'm not following.

You don't want
to go to classes,

you just want to play in a lab?

I don't want to sit in
a lecture that teaches me

how to modify algorithms
instead of think for myself.

And?

Okay, the people working
the weaving machines

in the 17th century, you know,

they didn't see
the steam engine coming.

One invention.
Industrial revolution.

I mean, Encyclopedia Britannica
didn't see Wikipedia coming.

Great things don't happen
in tiny little increments.

You know, they happen when

someone thinks completely
differently.

And all you geniuses,
you just--

you're just
modifying algorithms.

C-3PO, huh?

That dude's a badass.

You know, he's fluent in over

6 million
forms of communication.

Give me the money.

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

Give me your money.

Is that a toy gun?

Shot fires

Aah! Fuck!

Rock music

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Aah!

Horn honks Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Aah!

Get in. We drink.

Fuck-- oh, God damn it!

Hey, faggot.

I am not a faggot.

And I could sue you
for the use of the word.

Whoa, Nellie.
I'm on your side.

Come on in.
Let us buy you a drink.

Come on.
I'm not gonna bite--

unless you ask me to.

 Bottoms up

- What's with him?
- No idea.

He's been weird all day.

You, um-- you plagiarized
Nelson Mandela.

Who?

The MIT application essay.

Oh, you think I should have
wrote it myself?

No. I think
you shouldn't have

applied to colleges for me
without asking me.

I did ask you.

I asked you, like, 100 times
to get the applications in,

- and you ignored me.
- For a reason.

What reason,
that you're an idiot?

That you want
to waste your life laying around

in this shit-hole neighborhood
forever?

You have any idea
how much stuff

I had to steal and sell
to pay those application fees?

It was a huge pain in the ass,
and I did it for you.

So you could be a little bit
nicer about it.

You know, you might even
want to say thank you.

Thank you.

Both moaning

Thank you. Thank you!

Both grunting

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

May I transfer you to sales?

Thank you so much.

And you have a Worldwide day.

Hey, Fiona. You okay?

Huh? Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Mike's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

Maria got an infection
in the hospital.

She's gonna be out for at least
a couple more weeks.

I-I was thinking of requesting
you, if you're available.

Easier than training
a new girl every day.

That'd be great.

Only thing is,
Mr. Pratt, Sr.

Uncle Matt, we call him,
he's kind of conservative.

He's a deacon at First Baptist.

I'm sure that outfit
would have been great

at your last office, but--

Shit, really? Gasps Shit.

Oh, fuck-- mm. Sorry.

It's okay.
Just button up a little bit

and it'll all be all right.

Rock music

Please tell your father
I'm a big fan.



- It's truth, you see?
- What's truth?

That you are no good for Fiona.

What the hell do you know?

I know you
are not meant for this life.

You are a rich boy,
born with a silver spoon, eh?

It's okay not to be ashamed.

I am from the favela.
Okay?

And now I have silver spoon.
You can go that way.

But the other way?
Scoffs

That way is just misery.

Bitter. Resent. Miseria.

It's better you should go now,
before Fiona and

the kids get more, uh,
what's the--

- Attached.
- Attached, yes.

Or before you and Fiona
make a baby together.

'Cause after a baby,

then it's misery, bitter,
resent forever.

Men, we need space to think.

So walk, think.

This time,
I will not follow you.

Thanks, man.

Hey, but if you break any laws,

I will chop off
both your hands, eh?

I got it.

You use that Mandela speech
in all the applications?

No, mixed it up a little bit.

Couple of dead presidents
and some guy called "Gandy."

Gandhi?

I don't get why
you'd want me to go to MIT.

You know,
Boston's pretty far away.

I thought maybe you'd take me
with you, but--

But what?

No one's ever been
as good to me as you have.

You're better than this
neighborhood.

You're better
than anyone I've ever met.

And you deserve to get out--

even if you
don't take me with you,

which I never really
thought you would anyway.

So is it true?

You're getting married?

So who is it?
Is it Angie Zahgo

or some other piece of trash
you screw so you can pretend

I don't matter to you?

Hey, what the fuck, Gallagher?
Glass shatters

Oh, he speaks!

So that's it. We're over.

Your dad beats the shit
out of us,

and you're just gonna
get married, no conversation?

Nothing?

Get the fuck off me.

Oh, you want to fag bash?

That make you feel like a man?

Come on. Go ahead!
Do it!

Grunts

Fuck.

Gasping

You love me, and you're gay.

Just admit it, just this once.

Just fucking admit it.
Grunts

Coughs

You feel better now?

You feel like a man?

Groans

Grunts

I feel better now.

Oh, just the man
I was hoping to run into.

I can't see you anymore.

I'm with Mandy now.

Sorry, I, uh...

I shouldn't have started up
with you again.

You're not serious.

She's good for me,
and you're not.

And, uh...

yeah, that's all.

What about boys?

What about them?

- Well, do you like any?
- None that like me.

I'm not pretty like Fiona.

My teeth are messed up,
and my chest is flat.

You know, they have
special bras for that.

Door slams shut

- Hey.
- Hey, Karen.

Um, is there anything to eat?

Mom?

Jesus. What-fucking-ever!

Clatter Hey!

Stomping upstairs

What did she do that's so bad
that you won't talk to her?

She wrote the Wongs and
told them to take Hymie away.

She told them I was crazy and

that I had Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder

and that
I was bad for the baby.

I do have
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,

but I-I've been working
really hard to treat it.

And my meds have been
really working.

And I am a little crazy,

but I'm not bad for that baby.

That part's just not true.

Sheila?

Yeah, honey?

I've seen crazy,
and I've seen bad for kids.

You aren't
either of those things.

You're super nice.

I've made a lot of mistakes.

Then say you're sorry.

Because if Monica came back,
said she was sorry,

and stayed...
I'd forgive her.

I would forgive her
for everything,

because she's my mom.

I'm so...

sorry your mom left you.

But you-- you know
it's not your fault, right?

Do you know that?
It's not your fault.

Crying

Lighter sparks

Cell phone ringing

- Who's this?
- Hey, Mandy.

It's Karen Jackson.
I just wanted to call

and say thank you for
applying to colleges for Lip.

- What?
- My mom kind of sucks

these days, so it'll be awesome
to have somewhere new to go.

And all I have to do
is poke one hole in a condom,

and he'll do
whatever I say forever.

I mean, we learned that
from last time.

Fuck you.

Oh, you mean, like,
all three of us?

Yeah, I could be down for that.

Do you want me to ask Lip
next time we do it?

 Aren't you the one
who tried to hurt me

 when you said good-bye?

 Did you think I'd crumble?

 Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

 Oh, no, not I

 I will survive  Oh, yeah.

All:  Oh, as long
as I know how to love

 I know I'll stay alive

 I've got
all my life to live

 I've got
all my love to give

 I will survive
I will survive

Cheers and applause

Yeah!

Yeah!

Jesus. Oh. Whoa.

What's an Adam's apple matter

if you can blow like that?

Laid-back music



Hey. Hi.
You want a blowjob?

I'll give you
a blowjob for $10--

or a rock.
Do you have a rock?

I give really good blowjobs.

Siren blaring

Are you sure you don't want one?

Do you know how many
nerve endings

are in the foreskin of a penis?

I don't think there's
a single guy who wishes

he had more nerves down there.

Well, what if our son
wants to be a transsexual?

They will need that skin
to make him a proper vagina.

Why is that even a question?

The gays brought
the gift baskets, Kevin.

Look at all the gift baskets.

I'm saying, it's a possibility.

What's all this?

Frank told the world he's gay.

And the gay world responded
with chocolate and cheese.

- And good wine.
- Wow.

Debs, school,
why didn't you go?

Sheila was depressed,
like, bad depressed.

- Monica depressed.
- Code pink.

I'm sorry
you had to deal with that.

- Is Frank really gay?
- No. Laughs

Carl, it's a scam.
It's always some kind of scam.

This scam tastes awesome.

Is this dinner?

- Where's Jimmy?
- I don't know.

Think he's still wondering
if there's any more cheese?

- Laughs
- Try the moldy one.

- I like the one with the holes.
- Hey, put that down.

- Wipe your mouth afterwards.
- Laughs

What did Kevin say?

Laughter

Indistinct chatter downstairs

Knock at door

Come in.

Hi. Honey, hi.

Mom, I am not
in the mood right now.

I'm sorry I was so crazy
when you were little.

I-I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to get my meds balanced.

And I'm sorry
that I missed so many

of your school events because
I couldn't leave the house.

And I--

I'm sorry that I-I took up
with your husband,

even if you didn't want him.

It's just a-- well, just
a terrible thing

for a mother to do.

There-- there are so many ways
I wish I--

I could have been
a better mother to you.

I-I hope you can forgive me,
Karen.

I hope we can start over,
because I--

Sobs

I love you so very much.

I love you so much.

I--
Text alert

Okay, I'm sorry, mom.
It's-- it's Lip.

He wants to meet at the park.

Oh.

Oh. Are you--
are you seeing Lip again?

I hope so.

Okay.

Giggles

Horn honks

Fuck you too.
Stupid bitch.

Christopher!

Go away, Frank.
You're drunk.

You need a meeting.
Go away.

Christopher, why?

It was so good between us.

I'm sorry, Frank.

Mom says
this is how it has to be.

No, Chris, wait. Wait, Chris! Ohh!

Dogs barking

Rock music



So you like emergency
medicine, right?

Hours suck.
But, yeah, I love it.

And it's a shorter track
than surgery, right?

- Barely.
- Incoming ambulance.

Serious head trauma,
two minutes out.

All right.

- How's the money?
- The money's good.

And the saving people's lives
is pretty great, too.

You mean, like,
the adrenaline rush?

What's going on, man?

You thinking about
going back to school?

You know, thought I hated
med school, but U of M's

looking pretty damn great
right now.

Oh, hey. Bright.
Chuckles

Mr. Gallagher,
when you're ready to rise,

we'd like to buy you a meal
and have a chat.

What'd you hit?

Girl at school.

Don't forget to check for hair
behind the grill.

Call Manny
about the windshield.

We've looked into
your records, Frank.

You're an alcoholic,
a derelict.

Not the kind of man
we usually want on our side.

But you, my friend, have
stumbled ass over Teakettle

into the most
significant moment

in the history
of the gay rights movement.

We both know that
we're not second-class citizens,

but there are a lot of people
in this country

who still need convincing.

And you are the missing piece
in our puzzle.

You blue-collar, working-class,
Irish-Catholic.

You have the ears of the people

whose minds most need changing.

You also have dog shit on
your face and no place to live,

but we can fix that
if you agree to work with us.

You've got my attention, Mr.--

Paige. Abraham Paige.

We'll clean you up.
We'll house you.

We'll coach you.

Do you remember
"Joe The Plumber"?

Heard of him?
He's a personal hero of mine.

Well, you are gay Joe.

- Frank the plumber?
- No.

Frank, the father.

Frank, the son.
Frank, the neighbor.

Frank, the face
of the gay-rights movement.

Oh, jeez.

- Oh.
- Take it.

- Ow.
- Take it. This shit. Yeah.

- Ow.
- Take it, you little gimp.

Turn over.
Mama's gonna give you an exam.

Groans

- Take it.
- Ow.

- Take it.
- Ow.

Don't you shit on my hand.
You hear me?

- Yeah. Ooh. Take it.
- Ow.

Yeah.

Ah!

Both moaning





Drunk This is what you... (Indistinct)
last (Indistinct)...

I'm thinking about
going back to medical school.

Dr. Jimmy, huh?

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

- You can come with me.
- To Michigan?

Good luck
convincing her to move.

Fiona?

Estefania, dammit, your wife.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family.
The value of his word.

Are you a man of your word?

You don't live here anymore.

You still someone I can trust?

Mickey getting married.
Does that make sense to you?

She works at Garden Spring Spa,

if you call jerking off
random dudes "working."

Terry made Mickey fuck her
to fuck the gay out of 'em.

I know what he felt with me.

You can't fake that.

- What'd you hit?
- Girl at school.

I wasn't very nice to Karen.

She was so happy
when she got that text from you.

Text?

The night of the accident
when she came to meet you.

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

She's kind.
She's devoted.

She's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore.

Should we be
planning for the worst?

I've seen miracles.
They do happen.

Keep engaging her.

Let her know you're here.

You're a prince, Jody.

I think that you're her prince.

I took her prince.

She believed
in the kiss of true love.

Gasps

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

 know that
it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Inhales, groans

Oh, Jesus.

You look like a baby rabbit
when you sleep.

Exactly what every man
wants to hear

first thing in the morning.

Laughs

You awake long?

A while.

This whole Ann Arbor thing--

we can make it work.

Been doing some research.

Worldwide Cup
has an office in Canton

only 18 miles from campus.

- Wow.
- I know, right?

I'm gonna see
if they need help.

And the public schools there

are a hell of a lot better.

I called a couple.

They actually
answered the phone.

They said that Debbie and Carl
could transfer mid-year.

They're so nice about it.

I just don't want
the kids resenting me

for making them
leave their friends at school.

What friends?
Lip's graduating.

I'm not sure what to do
about Ian yet,

but I'll ask him
when he's feeling better.

- And the house?
- Sublet it, maybe.

I don't know yet.

Wow. I mean,
you've really turned a corner.

Chuckles Yeah.

- Morning.
- Mm.

You never
came to bed last night.

Yeah, no, sorry,
I got sucked into, um...

Zambian women's boxing.

Muscular women
make me feel funny.

Sounds hot.

Can you hurry up and get ready?

I want to get to school early.

Gonna swipe
some bags of tater tots

from the cafeteria
for Mickey's wedding.

Okay, I'll be right up.

Late start this morning, guys.

- Sorry, you're on your own.
- Oh, thanks, Debs.

We're out of peanut butter.

Is Ian staying home
from school again today?

Yes, he is.
His stomach is still messed up.

- Any more pop tarts left?
- Carl finished them.

- He ate three.
- I'm a growing boy.

"Little Broski" took a big-boy
dump on the big-boy toilet!

Hey! Mwah!

We're gonna celebrate
by walking to the store

for some butt wipes.

And peanut butter
and pop tarts.

And tampons. Sorry.

And make sure he wears a hat.
It's getting cold.

- Tampons.
- Bye, family!

Bye, Fiona!
Butch it up, dude.

Growls

Dude.

You gotta get up at some point.

I'm losing my mind. I--

I can't stop thinking
about the wedding.

All right,
last time I'm gonna say it.

Do yourself a favor.

Stay as far away from that
car wreck as humanly possible.

Okay?
It's not worth it.

Can you help me set up
this afternoon at the VFW?

Uh, no, you know what?
I promised I'd go to Sheila's.

You know,
Karen's getting home tonight.

- Gotta help set up.
- I'll help.

- You sure?
- Yeah.

Hey, wait, dude,
aren't you sick?

I don't get why Jody and Sheila

can't set up
Karen's shit by themselves.

Look, she needs
a lot of stuff, okay?

She can't even
walk by herself yet.

She's got frontal lobe damage.

The dude who hit her

probably doesn't even
have a scratch on him.

 I turn to stone

 I can't go on

 I'm so alone without you

 it ended so

 can't take the toll
without you



Go away.
This is my turf!

Your turf?
What is this,West Side Story?

You can't own a whole train car.
It's public property.

Sleeping in this car six years.

Pissed, puked, jizzed in it.

By law of bodily fluids,
it's mine.

Chuckles

Well, I'm not moving.

Stop it!

You're a terrible
homeless person.

I'm not homeless.
I have a home.

Then why didn't you
go there last night?

I was on my way there

when I sat down here
and accidentally fell asleep.

Bullshit. You look like a bum,
you smell like a bum.

I'm a passenger.

Get off my lawn.

All right!

I'm going!

To my house, where I live,

like a respectable human being.

I have labeled
the quarterly reports

from the last four years

with color-coded tabs,
stapled and collated.

And I've included double-sided
copies for the archive.

Oh, dang, maestro.

I was wondering
if you knew of any positions

opening up
in your Michigan office.

Uh, I could ask.
You leaving us?

My boyfriend might be
going to med school at U of M.

We're not sure yet.

Wow. That's terrific.

We'll be sad to see you go.

Me too.

Uh, sorry.

I don't know
if you're busy this weekend,

but my family has a cabin.

It's like a half an hour drive
north of here.

We go every year
during the fall,

we camp,
and toast marshmallows,

and kinda drink our faces off.

Uh...

Shit, so--

I'm doing this really,
really badly.

I am totally
inviting both of you

and the pile of kids you brought
to the softball game.

Real-- they'd have a great time.
How many are there total?

Two teens, two preteens,
and a toddler.

Perfect, I mean,
we've got extra tents,

we've got sub-zero
sleeping bags,

the little ones share a tent,

tell ghost stories,
while the adults

just get blitzed by the fire.

And I mean, tons of people
from work usually come.

It's great.

Sounds good.

My brothers
might have a wedding,

but I'll check
with the rest of the gang.

Yeah, cool. Let me know.

Okay.

Phone plays sheep bleating

What's that, Liam?

Is that the world's
most annoying sheep?

What's he saying?

Imitates bleating

Cell phone rings

Whoa.

- Whoa, are they there now?
- Who?

- The INS.
- No.

Then why are you calling me?

I have this stupid shoe
I bought, and it break.

And I tried to call to complain,
but they don't understand me.

You call, yeah?

No, Estefania,
this number's for emergencies.

I'm bored, Steve.

All I do, I sit here
with textbooks, go shopping,

I get bad sex with horny boys
with tiny pintinhos.

Okay, okay.

I will go to the store later.

- Come over.
- Okay, okay.

Gotta go.
Here, here, here.

Phone plays pig oinking
What's that? What's that, Liam?

Is that a piggy? A filthy,
snorting bacon machine?

Oinks

Wow. Can you do
cows and chickens too?

Not as good as your mom.

I have your mail.

Cable, utility, rent.
Your checkbook. Sign?

I have personal things
for you as well.

TV guide, architectural di--
anthropologie.

Is that for girls?

I also have this.

University of Michigan
enrollment notification.

Classes begin in January?

You opened my mail?
That's a felony.

So you were able
to convince Estefania to move?

It's-- um--

it's a work in progress.
I'm working on it. Just don't--

Ah, but Fiona's
aware of your plans, I assume.

You're getting careless.

Don't.

Door opens Hey.

Hey. Uh...
Clears throat

bad time?

No, just putting together
some baby stuff way prematurely.

- Chuckles
- What's up?

Um, I need your advice.

Well, if it's about infants,
college, or tiny dicks,

I'm the wrong guy.

Uh, no, it's, um--

it's about crazy.
You were married to once.

Why, is Mandy going
a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran over
Karen with her car.

What?

I think she-- she ran over
Karen with her car,

and also she-- she carries this
like huge stockpile of arms--

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

Your current girlfriend

ran over your ex-girlfriend
with a car?

Signs point to yes.
I mean, I--

I don't know. I don't know
what she's capable of.

Dude, you're at DEFCON 1.

You need to get
the fuck outta there.

Tell me how.

Very slowly.

You need to make her think
it's her idea.

Keep your distance.

Because once they get
behind the wheel,

there's no going back.

Okay. I mean, I'm--
I'm-- I'm gone a lot, you know?

They need a lot of help
over at Karen's, so--

Whoa, whoa, Lip, wait, wait.

Does Mandy know
you're going over there?

Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I told her--

- Lip, you can't
tell her that shit!

That's like waving the flag
in front of the bull!

- Well--
- Hide the car keys,

stop showering,
and you tell her nothing.

And whatever you do,
do not-- Lip.

Do not let her bone you,

because that oxytocin stuff
makes them adhesive.

You got it?

Yeah.

I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

- Fiona and Lip will be mad.
- Well, of course they will.

They treat me like a leper
because I'm "a bad father."

Yeah, right.

Tell you, you haven't
seen bad parenting

till you witness my mother
in her glory days.

Had this piece of wood
she called a retribution stick.

Flat side, skinny side.

If I did something small,
like steal an extra cookie

or piss in her shampoo bottle--
whack. Flat side.

But if I did something heinous,

like set fire to her bed
when she was napping,

or rat her out for her
garage gambling ring,

the skinny side.

Like a whip.

Whack! Whack!
Whack, whack, whack!

Whack! Whack!

Whack! But did I
throw that bitch

into the gutter
when she needed a home? No.

I brushed her hair.
I washed her saggy tits.

I irrigated her ulcers.

I nursed her
all the way to the grave.

But you people, making me
homeless in the dead of autumn?

After I got you through cancer?

I slept on a train last night!

Cool. Can I try that?

No! It's barbaric.
I have no place to go!

Do you get it?

I could sneak you
in the van tonight.

You'd do that for me?

You little piker, you.

You made it.

Chairs are over here,
and watch out for splinters.

You know, um,
Lip is still up Karen's ass.

It's getting old.

Yeah.

So, Svetlana.
She like, uh--

She's quiet.

And skinny, which is weird,

'cause he usually
bags fat chicks.

I do his laundry.

I apply to colleges for him,
and what the hell does Karen do?

Drools and farts.
I mean, come on.

Think he loves her?

She's brain-dead.

- I mean Mickey.
- I dunno.

Tons of guys
get chicks knocked up

and don't get hitched, so...

Dad's super excited.
Planned the whole thing.

Invited his buds
from the gun club.

It's kind of sweet.

Chair clatters

Phone playing animal sounds

Hey, look what I
stole from work.

Three cheers
for Captain Cappuccino.

Take some cream
with that hostility?

Oh, no, it's fine,
just whisk my best friend off

when I'm about to have a baby,
no biggie.

Whoa,
we're telling people already?

Not "people." Just V.

And Mike from work, who says
he'll look into transferring me.

Oh, don't get
your panties in a wad.

I know how
to keep my mouth shut.

Look, I'm happy for you.
I'm just sad for me.

Oh... don't worry,

we'll come visit
your li'l peanut once a month.

Or you could come stay with us.
Cell phone ringing

I found a couple four and five
bedroom houses online today.

Cheaper than Chicago.

Pizza!

Come get it while it's hot!

- Pizza!
- Pepperoni!

How was school?

We did fractions today.

Chew your food like a human.
Phone whinnies

So, Mike from the office

is planning this big
camping trip this weekend,

and we're all invited.

You wanna go?

- Yeah! Can we make s'mores?
- Uh-huh.

- And shoot raccoons?
- No.

Interested?

Love camping in theory,
except for the bugs,

and the dirt,
and the ground-sleeping.

But yeah, sounds great.

Mwah.

Well, caffeine addicts await.

Bye-bye, Dr. Jim.

So...

Sighs

you guys know
how Jimmy's thinking about

maybe going back to med school?

- Mm-hmm.
- No.

Okay, well,

if he does,

it would be in Michigan.

He'd leave us?

Or we'd go with him.

Maybe.

To Michigan.
What about school?

Well, it'll only be for a year.

And nothing's decided.

I just want you
to start thinking about it.

What about Frank?
We can't leave him here.

- Of course we can.
- But it's getting cold.

His thick layer of bullshit
will keep him warm.

Cell phone ringing

Laughs Mm.

Hello?

Jimmy's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

Oh, wow, where is it?

How many bathrooms?

A studio?

I will pass that on.

Who was that?

Ann Arbor Rentals.

The application
Jimmy put in went through.

What's a studio?

It's a one-room apartment,
Debs.

I thought you said
it wasn't decided yet.

How are we all
gonna fit in one room?

Door opens

They're here!
They're here!

They're here!

They're here!
Gasps

Welcome home!
Welcome home!

Look at you, sweet girl!

I'm gonna go grab her stuff.

Look at you.
You look so much better.

Oh, my gosh, the color's
back in your cheeks.

Are you happy to be home?

Yes. I--

This place is nice.
I remember.

Aw...

Hi, Lip.

Hi.

I-I'm, um...

I'm sorry we didn't
install the rails outside.

It's just been so wet.

Um, are you hungry?
I made smoothies.

I'll get you some.

Door opens, closes

Here we go.

What is this?

It's a smoothie.

Slurping

Ahh...

I like the cold on my throat.

And the tongue-taste.

What is this?

Well, it's a smoothie.

- Right.
- Oh.

Inhales

Mm, good night.

What did Dr. Ron
say about this?

She still has
most of her old memories,

she just can't form
any new ones.

Got some pamphlets
from the hospital.

Yeah, thanks.

Um, when's it go away?

Everyone's different, you know?

Could be permanent,
but I say we keep hope alive.

I got family down in Sedona.

They have
healing vortexes out there.

Alternative treatments
and stuff.

Oh, she just got home.

We don't know
what she needs yet.

She seems nicer though.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You left your phone at home.

You didn't have to come down
here to bring it to me.

- You got a weird phone call.
- From who?

Some lady from a--
from a rental place.

She said your credit's
been approved.

You can sign your contract on
your studio whenever you want.

Seems like a tight squeeze.
I mean, all of us in one room.

I filled out that application
form before we talked.

There was hardly anything
available on campus,

and it seemed like
a good opportunity.

So you put a deposit down.

I had to for them
to run the credit check.

On a studio apartment.

Okay, I guess I didn't
think it through.

What, have you signed up
for classes already?

Technically, I'm enrolled,
but it's complicated

- 'cause of my deferral.
- Hey!

Now might be a good time
for a little break-o.

So, you're going,
just like that?

Like I said, nothing's final.

But you had
no plans to bring us.

You've been slowly
backing away all along.

Think about it.

Isn't it so much easier
if I get a place over there

and come home on the weekends?

I mean, why uproot
the entire family?

- I can't even believe this.
- It's a four-hour train ride!

For one year,
it's totally doable!

You made the decision
without me,

as if it has
absolutely no effect on us.

Okay, and how is that
any different from what you did

when you decided to become
legal guardian of those kids?

You never once considered
how I'd be affected.

- Those kids are my life.
- No shit, Fiona.

And maybe if you would've
asked me, I woulda said, "yes.

Let's do this together."
But you didn't.

It didn't even
occur to you to ask me.

No, you have known from day one

what you were
getting into with me.

Right, I got sucked
into your world.

I bent to your rules.

I just assumed
that we'd eventually decide

how to move forward together
like couples do,

but there never was "we!"

What have I been doing?

Cooking, cleaning, laundry,
living in a goddamn slum!

Laughs

A slum?

You made me feel
like I could depend on you,

- and now it's a slum?
- Isn't it?

I got robbed at gunpoint
by a 12-year-old girl, Fiona!

Why don't you go find another
fuckin' place to sleep!

A fucking studio!

Whistles

Ahh. Old cigarettes
and skunk piss.

Here.

- Just crusts?
- That's all they had.

Well, what about breakfast?

Son...

I hope you never have to know

what it's like
to not have a home.

They'll get over it.
At least Fiona will.

I wouldn't count on it.

That ornery bitch
can hold a grudge.

People fuck up.
That's life.

Family is supposed
to be forever.

Supposed to take care of you
regardless of what you do.

That's the whole point,
otherwise why bother?

Christ!
Bangs head

There are vermin in here!

I'm your family.

You're right, son.
You haven't let me down.

When I was your age,

my pop took me
on my first heist.

We scored a hi-fi stereo,
about 600 bucks.

Booked a hotel,

blew all the dough
on room service and porn.

This was back
when you had to pay for it.

Man.
Those were the days.

I haven't thought
about that in years.

My foster gays
have a lot of nice stuff.

Your foster gays?

Cassius and Lanier.

Are you suggesting...

what I think you're suggesting?

- What do they got?
- iPods, computers...

- How often they there?
- They work weekends.

- Can you pick a lock?
- I have their security code.

Is that so?

That's all right.

Rock music



 Well, I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you know,
I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you don't forget,
oh, such a spin

 the meanest shake
that I could have ever been

 you know
that I'm struggling

 to pick myself
off the floor

 you know
that I'm struggling

Rise and shine.
We're going camping.

Pack some warm clothes, okay?

Gets cold by the lake at night.

Did you talk to Jimmy
about the studio yet?

No. Let's go.

Knocks on door

Good morning.

Let's go. Up and at 'em.



Good morning, milk dud!

Hey! Hi!
We're going camping!

You want to go camping?
It's so fun.

There's playing,
and singing, and kids.

And there's dirt.
Oh, you love dirt!

Can I do your ears,
or do you still hate that?

My ears.

Where's Jody?

He's at the Wongs',
picking up Hymie.

Do you remember Hymie?

I remember.
The Asian mongoloid.

Actually,
we can call him a retard.

We've earned that right.

Do you want to
spend time with him?

Yes.

Oh, that's wonderful.

He is so special.

You know, I saw this movie
the other day

about babies around the world.

Do you know
that mothers in Africa

wipe their babies' dirty bottoms
on their knees?

- Where's Jody?
- At the Wongs'.

And then they use leaves
to scrape the poop off.

I mean, why not just use
the leaves in the first place?

I don't understand
why they're not

sick all the time over there
with all that bacteria.

Bacteria.

I'm hungry.

I'll make sandwiches
after this.

Where's Jody?

I understand.

Knock on door
Both: Gasp

- Jody.
- Aww.

It's cool, mom, I got this.

Both: Giggle

Okay, we ready?

I can't find the flashlights.

Check the closets.

Yeah, I did, like, three times.

- Where's Carl?
- Said he's not going.

He doesn't feel well.

Oh, you look like garbage.

You sick?

No temperature.

Should we stay home?

- No, I'm not that sick.
- No, no, no, please...

Can we still go?
Liam will be so sad.

Sighs

Okay, but stay in bed.
Drink fluids.

Hey, can you hold him
for a second?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Get my coat on.

Okay.
Enjoy the wedding.

I can't wait
to hear the reports.

Bottles jingle

Jesus, Ian.

What time did you
get in last night?

- 3:00.
- Where were ya?

Out.
Burps

- Ew, gross!
- Okay.

Come on, upstairs.
Sleep it off.

Exhales

Sighs
Will someone please tell me

what the hell is going on
with that kid?

I'm sure he'll tell you
when he's ready.

I hope so.

- Okay, we are off.
- Okay.

Bye.

Bye, Debs.

- Bye!
- Bye!

Bye!

Nurture nature!

We haven't had sex
in over a week.

Yeah, I've, uh...

been a little distracted.

What the fuck?!

- Whatever you do...
- Hey--

Whatever you do...

do not...
do not...

let her bone you.

Hey--
Grunting

You belong here...

with me.

Not with that
fucking vegetable.

Aah!

Panting

Hey, man,
thanks for letting me crash.

Well, you just sorta
showed up, so...

What time did we
crap out last night?

I was in bed by 11:00.

You must have
passed out after 3:00,

'cause that's the last time
I heard the bathroom door slam.

Time five out of five,
each time louder than the last.

Hmm.

I'm-- I'm sorry, man.
I'm a mess.

- I got in this huge fight with--
- With your girlfriend.

We talked about it
for two hours straight.

Oh. Uh, hey,
what time is it?

1:30. I gotta split.
I'm on, uh, afternoon rotation.

You may as well finish that.

This door locks behind you
if you pull it hard,

- which you're awesome at, so...
- Okay.

Exhales

Cell phone beeps

Hey, uh, Kev, it's Lip.

Um...

look, I fucked up.
I, um--

I let her bone me. Just--
Footsteps approaching

call me back as soon
as you get this, all right?

- You okay in there?
- Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah, I'm just, uh,
a little backed up.

For 45 minutes?

Yup.

- Can I get you anything?
- No, please.

I'm-- I'm great. Okay?
I'm fine. Thank you.

I-I-I hate my dress.

I look like a drag queen.

You think Fiona would mind

- if I borrowed one of hers?
- Yes.

- She'd mind, or she'd let me?
- Mind!

Jesus!
Barge right in, why don't you?

What's going on?

I've got a lot
of stuff on my mind.

And you can't
talk to me about it?

No.

What time are you
gonna come tonight?

I don't know, late.
I got some shit I gotta do.

At Karen's?

Errands.

You know what?
Don't bother coming.

Have Nots' All Or None

 Never wanted nothing
other than

 to sing along with you all

 living under the radar

 but now we're
cleaning up the rubble

 from all the shit
we never wanted

 it's the pride in a life that
we never wanted to amount to

 and turned us into

 an indebted and indentured
servant to the human race

 force fed inherited
everything we couldn't take



Work it, Gallagher!
That's right, own that sack!

- Whoo!
- Hey!

What?
How long have you been here?

- Hi. Couple hours.
- Yeah?

Where you been?

Uh, I had to do a meat run.

Yeah, somebody accidentally
left the beef cooler

sitting on the driveway,
and by "someone," I mean me.

- Laughs
- You having fun?

It's my fourth.

Oh, very ni--
I will take that as a yes.

- Where's your peeps?
- Uh...

little redhead
is my sister Debbie,

and the little, brown baby
with the boogers

is my brother Liam.

Laughs
Nice, nice. Is that it?

Uh, yeah,
my brother Carl's sick,

my brother Ian has a hangover,

and my other brother Lip
had that wedding.

Gotcha, gotcha.

Where's your man?

Laughs Is that cup a perk?

Or did you
have to pay for that?

Hey, don't hate
'cause I get swag.

- Ah...
- Okay? I'm a full-timer.

Mm-hmm.

If you weren't
moving to Michigan,

- maybe you'd pull cups too.
- Well, shit.

How can I go now knowing that?

Well, shit,
I don't think you can.

Cheers.
Chuckles

Hey. Hop in.

I'll give you a ride.

Nando! Hey, wow!
When did you get here?

Early.

You f--

flew all the way from Brazil?

Miami.

I was there on business.

I'm ravenous.
We go eat?

Rock music

 She brought it down
from the big, big hill

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

 placed it
on your windowsill

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

 that cobra's
in the cave with you

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

You call me a punk for wanting
a boyfriend or whatever,

but you're gonna marry someone
who screws guys for a living?

Who gives a shit?

It's a fucking piece of paper.

Not to me.

Scoffs

Hey, come on-- look.

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean
we can't still bang.

Okay?

All right?

If you give half a shit
about me, Mickey--

Hey, hey.

Half.

Don't do this.

And these stairs
lead to the side room,

and this is the hallway
to the bedroom.

This is the outside deck.

The living room, the kitchen,

the other bedroom,
and the front room.

My God, how big is this place?

- Big.
- Bastards.

There's no more marshmallows.

I hate that.

They give you, like,
ten in the whole bag.

- What if they catch us?
- Visualize success.

What if they dust
for fingerprints?

Always wear gloves.
Got one. Chuckles

It's a treasure chest.
That's a good omen.

What about DNA testing?

Nobody bothers with that
CSIcrap, not on a burglary.

Cops'll see these faggots,
they won't give three wet farts.

Are you with me?

Hmm.

Okay, one, two, three, go.

Eh, we'll get it next time.

Mmm.

You haven't taken
one bite, Steve.

All this food going to waste.

Mmm.

Now, tell me...

I hear reports of, um,
medical school.

Uh, going back in January.

I'm gonna become
a dermatologist or a surgeon.

Good.

Cosmetic surgery's
a rich field.

Very lucrative.
Much potential.

Indeed.

And this would require
a move to another state.

Only temporary. I'm-- I'm still
working out the details.

You know,
I-I really just want to do

what's best for everyone.

Well, it sounds like
you want to do

what's best for yourself.

Uh, but having a doctor
husband for Estefania

would be a great thing.

You know, in America,
doctors are seen as heroes.

I'm familiar with your culture.

But the point
being is it's--

it's all good, you know?
Ann Arbor's a great town.

There's lots of shops.

Mm.

And when was the last time
you've seen my daughter?

Uh, two days ago.

Why?

I saw her three hours ago.

In INS Holding.

I suppose you're not aware
she's being deported.

Wait, why? Why--

You missed an INS visit
yesterday, Steve.

Why didn't she call me?

Well, she tried.
You didn't pick up.

And she failed to impress
the authorities.

Didn't even know your birthday.

My birthday is Christmas!
How hard is that to remember?

And your mother's name.

This is my fault?
We did-- we did flash cards.

I can't be with her
every second.

Sighs I ask
so little of you, Steve.

So little.

Stay out of trouble.

Be attentive to my daughter.

Her presence in this country
is controversial.

You understand that.

We were under a microscope.
I thought I made that clear.

Look, I'm so sorry
this happened,

I just don't know what could've
been done to prevent it.

That's precisely
the problem, isn't it, Steve?

What now?

Well, what's done
cannot be undone.

Now I must grease many palms.

It will be dealt with.

People cheering, chattering

Wait, so you're telling me

you've never
been to a strip club?

No. Just the thought
of a lap dance

actually makes me woozy.

- Laughs
- Like, do I grope?

If-- how do I go about doing that
in, like, a non-offensive way?

Like, do I make eye contact,
or is that--

that could be insulting,
'cause I mean,

she works so hard on her body.

Wow, you really are
a gentleman.

I am hardly a gentleman.

I just have a problem
with forced intimacy.

Blame my mother.

Your mom was a stripper?

Mm-hmm.
Laughs

Still a stripper, by the way.

Clears throat 90 years old.

Takes her like 40 minutes
to unhook her bra,

but when she does, what a show.

Laughs

So, uh...

we sorta ditched the party.

Yeah, we sorta did.

I'm gonna make
three assumptions.

Fire away.

Okay, one,
you're as drunk as I am.

- Correct. Shh.
- Laughs

Two, you're as cold as I am.

Colder. Less padding.

I'm gonna ignore that.

- Sighs
- Three...

you're a gentleman.

False.

Quite the opposite.

Hmm.

Well, then you better
behave yourself,

because I am way too drunk
not to invite you

back to my tent right now.

God damn, Gallagher.

I oughta get you
pissed off more often.

So, what are we gonna do?

We gonna
tell everyone to leave?

Nah.

I'll go get
this shit over with,

and, uh, you can
wait here for me.

Shouldn't take
more than an hour, right?

You better be ready
for round two.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Why are you acting
like I got a choice in this?

This is bullshit.

Listen to me, Mickey.

Your dad is an evil,
psychotic prick.

You're just gonna
let him ruin your life?

You need to grow the fuck up.

Don't act like you know
a thing about my dad.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Not everybody
gets to just--

not everybody just gets to

blurt out how they fuckin' feel
every minute.

Footsteps approaching

Everyone's looking for you.

I'm having a fuckin' smoke.
Is that all right?

You just get here?

Yeah.

I didn't know you were coming.

Last-minute decision.

Come on.

Mendelssohn's Wedding March



Beeping

Have Nots' Dead Man



 Dead man walking
like a wind-up toy

 plodding, never plotting for
the things that bring him joy

 living in the movies
like he's celluloid

 and then it's over

 so roll the credits now

 dead man standing
single file in every line

 gave up on the searching

 he was scared
of what he'd find

 but I don't wanna live
like I'm headed to the grave

 no, I don't wanna
live that way

 got a purpose and a plan

 and I don't wanna live
like a dead man



Both: Panting, moaning

Ah!

What, what?
You okay?

What am I doing?
What am I doing?

Do you want to stop?
We can stop.

- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

We got carried away, all right?
These things happen.

I don't know what I'm doing.

You're using me for revenge.

Am I?

I'm not saying that I mind.
I-I-I do not mind.

I just recognize the impulse.

He was planning on
going to Michigan without me.

Oh, shit.

He acted like he was
gonna take all of us,

but it's not even
the first time that he's lied.

I closed my stupid eyes to it

'cause I wanted it
to work so bad.

Your eyes aren't stupid.

Sighs Oh, I'm an idiot.

Just because
someone dumps on you

does not mean you deserve it.

Tell me that
when someone's dumping on you.

Eve?

That's my wife.

Ex-wife. God.

Papers went through last week.

I'm kinda too chicken
to get it removed,

so I'm thinking about
making it into a bigger word.

- Chuckles
- Like, uh...

"Sleeve" maybe.
Laughs

"Eleven."
I don't know.

Both: Laugh

I guess you're lucky
her name wasn't "Ocksucker."

Both: Laugh

Yeah.

Yeah.

When did you know
when it was over?

When she started
going to the gym every day.

Sighs You?

Without a hitch.

Son, you did good.

Whispers Close the door.
Close the door.

How much you think
it's all worth?

I don't know.
Maybe 3 grand?

- Really?
- Damn straight.

Hey, let's celebrate.

Go cook us up some spaghettios.

Lis-- listen, I know
that I got sloppy, Nando,

but I will fix it.
Just tell me what I can do.

Run-- run drugs,
steal cars,

you know, my dad has connections
in the government.

He's a powerful man.

He supported
immigration legislation--

So much traffic today.
Are the cubs playing?

It's-- you know what?

It's a good thing
this happened, actually.

I mean, not entirely,
of course,

but I-I'm completely clear
on the rules.

You know, I'm absolutely
on the same page as you.

I mean, thank you for that.
Truly. Truly.

Oh, let's go see who that is.

Oh, hey!

I'm just finishing up
Karen's favorite snack.

Snickerdoodle cupcakes.

She's upstairs.

Um, but hey, um, you don't need

to install the motion lights

because Jody is taking
Karen and Hymie to Sedona

to live near
the vortexes, so...

It's fine.
They're gonna be near family.

And she is his wife, after all.

Is-- is Mrs. Wong
okay with Hymie leaving?

Well, she's his mother,

and babies belong
with their mothers, so...

You go on up.
I'll be right there with snacks.

Chuckles

Hey.

How you feeling?

Exhales

Your mom says you're moving.

I am?

Yeah, to Arizona?

Oh.

The Grand Canyon.

Cactuses.

Right.

Hey...

I know you're in there.
It's just us now, okay?

We can talk.

Hey, uh...

you remember that day

we, uh-- we got drunk

and, uh,
ran around Lincoln Park

setting off all the alarms
on the Priuses?

Yeah.

And then we, um--

we climbed the Lincoln statue

and gave Old Abe some, uh,
lipstick with red sharpie.

Yeah... yeah.

Yeah, you were, uh,
fucking fearless.

And a total shithead.

I remember, um, you made me
go down on you that night

in the bathroom of Bennigan's.

You remember all that?

Yes.

But...

I can't feel.

Feel what?

Stuff.

Inside.

I, uh...

I don't know what that means.

I can't explain.

But...

it's okay.

Are there snacks?

Mandy.
Mandy did this. Okay?

Mandy hit you with the car
and fucked you up forever!

All right?
Because of me.

Mandy Milkovich.

Yes.

Do you understand me?

- Yes.
- Okay.

Do you know who hit you?

No.

Are there snacks?

 Lady in red

People chattering

 is dancing with me

 cheek to cheek

 there's nobody here

Mandy!

Come here.

Laughs
Couldn't stay away, could you?

You ruined Karen's life!

You're a jealous,
demented cunt, Mandy!

Seriously!

All right? We're done!

I did it for you, you prick.

I did everything for you,
but you're so fucking blind.

You know what, don't sweat it.

We were done
before you got here.

This is Kenyatta.

He's my date.

I just swallowed his load
in the bathroom.

Can you taste it?

He did it.

He got married.
To a woman.

I told you
not to come here, okay?

You try sitting on your ass
while the person you love--

No, I'm sorry, I mean
the guy you've been fucking

gets married
to some random commie skank!

Fuckin' commie!

 You were amazing

 never seen
so many people--

Let's go.

Get out of the car.

Sniffles

Okay.

Be a man.
Just this once.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Deep breath.

- Breathes deeply
- Chin up.

Get onto the boat.

Can I just make
one phone call to Fiona?

Please?

Cell phone splashes Fuck.

Engine growling

I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

We're so close.

I gotta lay down
for a little bit.

Ian, hey, stop.
No! We're here!

I'm gonna puke.

Police radios

We know you've been stealing...

Fuck.

- Kid, settle down.
- Hey, whoa, can I help you?

Who are you?

I'm his brother.
What's going on?

We have reason
to believe this child

may have robbed
his former foster parents

while they were
at work this afternoon.

Yeah?
What proof you got?

He had a special security code
assigned to him.

He's the only one
that knows it.

All right, as far as I can
tell, that's not evidence.

Get your fuckin'
hands off him, man.

His code was a series
of four letters.

C-A-R-L.

Take your fuckin' hands
off him, man!

He's just a fucking kid!

All right,
that's enough of that.

Step back, sir.

Take your hands
off the officer right now!

Step away from the officer.

It's gonna be okay.

This kid stole
from people, all right?

- We're taking him in.
- You're ta-- he's a fucking kid!

Do not touch the officer.

- Step back right now!
- Carl, come here!

If you interfere again,
I will arrest you!

Do not touch him!

Why are you being
so rough with him?

You are gonna have to--

Why is he being
so fucking rough with him?

You touch him again,
I will arrest you!

Whoa, whoa.
Good evening, gentlemen.

- Are you the parent?
- Why, yes, I am.

What the fuck
are you doing here, Frank?

I'm coming home.

We're taking your son
in for questioning.

He didn't do the heist, I did.

You see?
Shiny, but a little bit big.

I also got a boatload
of electronics-- those sold fast.

Did you know that Chicago
has several 24-hour pawn shops?

He-- he didn't--
he's innocent.

I forced him
to give me the code.

Didn't I?
Son, tell 'em.

Oh, my God.
He's dumber than a bag of hair.

He couldn't pull off a band-aid,
much less a robbery.

Okay, here.

Cuff me,
before I get disorderly.

Handcuffs click

Be brave, son!

Order room service.

Hey, it's Steve.
Leave some words.

Beeps

Hey, it's me.

Scoffs
Five kids at med school.

What was I thinking?

And you're right.
We live in a slum.

It's a four-hour train ride.
That's nothing.

We can make this work.

We have to.

I love you.

Call me.

Sighs





Drunk This is what you... (Indistinct)
last (Indistinct)...

I'm thinking about
going back to medical school.

Dr. Jimmy, huh?

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

- You can come with me.
- To Michigan?

Good luck
convincing her to move.

Fiona?

Estefania, dammit, your wife.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family.
The value of his word.

Are you a man of your word?

You don't live here anymore.

You still someone I can trust?

Mickey getting married.
Does that make sense to you?

She works at Garden Spring Spa,

if you call jerking off
random dudes "working."

Terry made Mickey fuck her
to fuck the gay out of 'em.

I know what he felt with me.

You can't fake that.

- What'd you hit?
- Girl at school.

I wasn't very nice to Karen.

She was so happy
when she got that text from you.

Text?

The night of the accident
when she came to meet you.

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

She's kind.
She's devoted.

She's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore.

Should we be
planning for the worst?

I've seen miracles.
They do happen.

Keep engaging her.

Let her know you're here.

You're a prince, Jody.

I think that you're her prince.

I took her prince.

She believed
in the kiss of true love.

The Luck You Got



 Think of all the luck
you got

it's not for naught

 You were beaming
once before

 but it's not like that
anymore

 What is this downside

 that you speak of?

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?



 Round up the friends
you got

 know that
they're not for naught

 You were willing
once before

 but it's not like that

 What is this feeling

 you're so sure of?

Inhales, groans

Oh, Jesus.

You look like a baby rabbit
when you sleep.

Exactly what every man
wants to hear

first thing in the morning.

Laughs

You awake long?

A while.

This whole Ann Arbor thing--

we can make it work.

Been doing some research.

Worldwide Cup
has an office in Canton

only 18 miles from campus.

- Wow.
- I know, right?

I'm gonna see
if they need help.

And the public schools there

are a hell of a lot better.

I called a couple.

They actually
answered the phone.

They said that Debbie and Carl
could transfer mid-year.

They're so nice about it.

I just don't want
the kids resenting me

for making them
leave their friends at school.

What friends?
Lip's graduating.

I'm not sure what to do
about Ian yet,

but I'll ask him
when he's feeling better.

- And the house?
- Sublet it, maybe.

I don't know yet.

Wow. I mean,
you've really turned a corner.

Chuckles Yeah.

- Morning.
- Mm.

You never
came to bed last night.

Yeah, no, sorry,
I got sucked into, um...

Zambian women's boxing.

Muscular women
make me feel funny.

Sounds hot.

Can you hurry up and get ready?

I want to get to school early.

Gonna swipe
some bags of tater tots

from the cafeteria
for Mickey's wedding.

Okay, I'll be right up.

Late start this morning, guys.

- Sorry, you're on your own.
- Oh, thanks, Debs.

We're out of peanut butter.

Is Ian staying home
from school again today?

Yes, he is.
His stomach is still messed up.

- Any more pop tarts left?
- Carl finished them.

- He ate three.
- I'm a growing boy.

"Little Broski" took a big-boy
dump on the big-boy toilet!

Hey! Mwah!

We're gonna celebrate
by walking to the store

for some butt wipes.

And peanut butter
and pop tarts.

And tampons. Sorry.

And make sure he wears a hat.
It's getting cold.

- Tampons.
- Bye, family!

Bye, Fiona!
Butch it up, dude.

Growls

Dude.

You gotta get up at some point.

I'm losing my mind. I--

I can't stop thinking
about the wedding.

All right,
last time I'm gonna say it.

Do yourself a favor.

Stay as far away from that
car wreck as humanly possible.

Okay?
It's not worth it.

Can you help me set up
this afternoon at the VFW?

Uh, no, you know what?
I promised I'd go to Sheila's.

You know,
Karen's getting home tonight.

- Gotta help set up.
- I'll help.

- You sure?
- Yeah.

Hey, wait, dude,
aren't you sick?

I don't get why Jody and Sheila

can't set up
Karen's shit by themselves.

Look, she needs
a lot of stuff, okay?

She can't even
walk by herself yet.

She's got frontal lobe damage.

The dude who hit her

probably doesn't even
have a scratch on him.

 I turn to stone

 I can't go on

 I'm so alone without you

 it ended so

 can't take the toll
without you



Go away.
This is my turf!

Your turf?
What is this,West Side Story?

You can't own a whole train car.
It's public property.

Sleeping in this car six years.

Pissed, puked, jizzed in it.

By law of bodily fluids,
it's mine.

Chuckles

Well, I'm not moving.

Stop it!

You're a terrible
homeless person.

I'm not homeless.
I have a home.

Then why didn't you
go there last night?

I was on my way there

when I sat down here
and accidentally fell asleep.

Bullshit. You look like a bum,
you smell like a bum.

I'm a passenger.

Get off my lawn.

All right!

I'm going!

To my house, where I live,

like a respectable human being.

I have labeled
the quarterly reports

from the last four years

with color-coded tabs,
stapled and collated.

And I've included double-sided
copies for the archive.

Oh, dang, maestro.

I was wondering
if you knew of any positions

opening up
in your Michigan office.

Uh, I could ask.
You leaving us?

My boyfriend might be
going to med school at U of M.

We're not sure yet.

Wow. That's terrific.

We'll be sad to see you go.

Me too.

Uh, sorry.

I don't know
if you're busy this weekend,

but my family has a cabin.

It's like a half an hour drive
north of here.

We go every year
during the fall,

we camp,
and toast marshmallows,

and kinda drink our faces off.

Uh...

Shit, so--

I'm doing this really,
really badly.

I am totally
inviting both of you

and the pile of kids you brought
to the softball game.

Real-- they'd have a great time.
How many are there total?

Two teens, two preteens,
and a toddler.

Perfect, I mean,
we've got extra tents,

we've got sub-zero
sleeping bags,

the little ones share a tent,

tell ghost stories,
while the adults

just get blitzed by the fire.

And I mean, tons of people
from work usually come.

It's great.

Sounds good.

My brothers
might have a wedding,

but I'll check
with the rest of the gang.

Yeah, cool. Let me know.

Okay.

Phone plays sheep bleating

What's that, Liam?

Is that the world's
most annoying sheep?

What's he saying?

Imitates bleating

Cell phone rings

Whoa.

- Whoa, are they there now?
- Who?

- The INS.
- No.

Then why are you calling me?

I have this stupid shoe
I bought, and it break.

And I tried to call to complain,
but they don't understand me.

You call, yeah?

No, Estefania,
this number's for emergencies.

I'm bored, Steve.

All I do, I sit here
with textbooks, go shopping,

I get bad sex with horny boys
with tiny pintinhos.

Okay, okay.

I will go to the store later.

- Come over.
- Okay, okay.

Gotta go.
Here, here, here.

Phone plays pig oinking
What's that? What's that, Liam?

Is that a piggy? A filthy,
snorting bacon machine?

Oinks

Wow. Can you do
cows and chickens too?

Not as good as your mom.

I have your mail.

Cable, utility, rent.
Your checkbook. Sign?

I have personal things
for you as well.

TV guide, architectural di--
anthropologie.

Is that for girls?

I also have this.

University of Michigan
enrollment notification.

Classes begin in January?

You opened my mail?
That's a felony.

So you were able
to convince Estefania to move?

It's-- um--

it's a work in progress.
I'm working on it. Just don't--

Ah, but Fiona's
aware of your plans, I assume.

You're getting careless.

Don't.

Door opens Hey.

Hey. Uh...
Clears throat

bad time?

No, just putting together
some baby stuff way prematurely.

- Chuckles
- What's up?

Um, I need your advice.

Well, if it's about infants,
college, or tiny dicks,

I'm the wrong guy.

Uh, no, it's, um--

it's about crazy.
You were married to once.

Why, is Mandy going
a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran over
Karen with her car.

What?

I think she-- she ran over
Karen with her car,

and also she-- she carries this
like huge stockpile of arms--

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

Your current girlfriend

ran over your ex-girlfriend
with a car?

Signs point to yes.
I mean, I--

I don't know. I don't know
what she's capable of.

Dude, you're at DEFCON 1.

You need to get
the fuck outta there.

Tell me how.

Very slowly.

You need to make her think
it's her idea.

Keep your distance.

Because once they get
behind the wheel,

there's no going back.

Okay. I mean, I'm--
I'm-- I'm gone a lot, you know?

They need a lot of help
over at Karen's, so--

Whoa, whoa, Lip, wait, wait.

Does Mandy know
you're going over there?

Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I told her--

- Lip, you can't
tell her that shit!

That's like waving the flag
in front of the bull!

- Well--
- Hide the car keys,

stop showering,
and you tell her nothing.

And whatever you do,
do not-- Lip.

Do not let her bone you,

because that oxytocin stuff
makes them adhesive.

You got it?

Yeah.

I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

- Fiona and Lip will be mad.
- Well, of course they will.

They treat me like a leper
because I'm "a bad father."

Yeah, right.

Tell you, you haven't
seen bad parenting

till you witness my mother
in her glory days.

Had this piece of wood
she called a retribution stick.

Flat side, skinny side.

If I did something small,
like steal an extra cookie

or piss in her shampoo bottle--
whack. Flat side.

But if I did something heinous,

like set fire to her bed
when she was napping,

or rat her out for her
garage gambling ring,

the skinny side.

Like a whip.

Whack! Whack!
Whack, whack, whack!

Whack! Whack!

Whack! But did I
throw that bitch

into the gutter
when she needed a home? No.

I brushed her hair.
I washed her saggy tits.

I irrigated her ulcers.

I nursed her
all the way to the grave.

But you people, making me
homeless in the dead of autumn?

After I got you through cancer?

I slept on a train last night!

Cool. Can I try that?

No! It's barbaric.
I have no place to go!

Do you get it?

I could sneak you
in the van tonight.

You'd do that for me?

You little piker, you.

You made it.

Chairs are over here,
and watch out for splinters.

You know, um,
Lip is still up Karen's ass.

It's getting old.

Yeah.

So, Svetlana.
She like, uh--

She's quiet.

And skinny, which is weird,

'cause he usually
bags fat chicks.

I do his laundry.

I apply to colleges for him,
and what the hell does Karen do?

Drools and farts.
I mean, come on.

Think he loves her?

She's brain-dead.

- I mean Mickey.
- I dunno.

Tons of guys
get chicks knocked up

and don't get hitched, so...

Dad's super excited.
Planned the whole thing.

Invited his buds
from the gun club.

It's kind of sweet.

Chair clatters

Phone playing animal sounds

Hey, look what I
stole from work.

Three cheers
for Captain Cappuccino.

Take some cream
with that hostility?

Oh, no, it's fine,
just whisk my best friend off

when I'm about to have a baby,
no biggie.

Whoa,
we're telling people already?

Not "people." Just V.

And Mike from work, who says
he'll look into transferring me.

Oh, don't get
your panties in a wad.

I know how
to keep my mouth shut.

Look, I'm happy for you.
I'm just sad for me.

Oh... don't worry,

we'll come visit
your li'l peanut once a month.

Or you could come stay with us.
Cell phone ringing

I found a couple four and five
bedroom houses online today.

Cheaper than Chicago.

Pizza!

Come get it while it's hot!

- Pizza!
- Pepperoni!

How was school?

We did fractions today.

Chew your food like a human.
Phone whinnies

So, Mike from the office

is planning this big
camping trip this weekend,

and we're all invited.

You wanna go?

- Yeah! Can we make s'mores?
- Uh-huh.

- And shoot raccoons?
- No.

Interested?

Love camping in theory,
except for the bugs,

and the dirt,
and the ground-sleeping.

But yeah, sounds great.

Mwah.

Well, caffeine addicts await.

Bye-bye, Dr. Jim.

So...

Sighs

you guys know
how Jimmy's thinking about

maybe going back to med school?

- Mm-hmm.
- No.

Okay, well,

if he does,

it would be in Michigan.

He'd leave us?

Or we'd go with him.

Maybe.

To Michigan.
What about school?

Well, it'll only be for a year.

And nothing's decided.

I just want you
to start thinking about it.

What about Frank?
We can't leave him here.

- Of course we can.
- But it's getting cold.

His thick layer of bullshit
will keep him warm.

Cell phone ringing

Laughs Mm.

Hello?

Jimmy's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

Oh, wow, where is it?

How many bathrooms?

A studio?

I will pass that on.

Who was that?

Ann Arbor Rentals.

The application
Jimmy put in went through.

What's a studio?

It's a one-room apartment,
Debs.

I thought you said
it wasn't decided yet.

How are we all
gonna fit in one room?

Door opens

They're here!
They're here!

They're here!

They're here!
Gasps

Welcome home!
Welcome home!

Look at you, sweet girl!

I'm gonna go grab her stuff.

Look at you.
You look so much better.

Oh, my gosh, the color's
back in your cheeks.

Are you happy to be home?

Yes. I--

This place is nice.
I remember.

Aw...

Hi, Lip.

Hi.

I-I'm, um...

I'm sorry we didn't
install the rails outside.

It's just been so wet.

Um, are you hungry?
I made smoothies.

I'll get you some.

Door opens, closes

Here we go.

What is this?

It's a smoothie.

Slurping

Ahh...

I like the cold on my throat.

And the tongue-taste.

What is this?

Well, it's a smoothie.

- Right.
- Oh.

Inhales

Mm, good night.

What did Dr. Ron
say about this?

She still has
most of her old memories,

she just can't form
any new ones.

Got some pamphlets
from the hospital.

Yeah, thanks.

Um, when's it go away?

Everyone's different, you know?

Could be permanent,
but I say we keep hope alive.

I got family down in Sedona.

They have
healing vortexes out there.

Alternative treatments
and stuff.

Oh, she just got home.

We don't know
what she needs yet.

She seems nicer though.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You left your phone at home.

You didn't have to come down
here to bring it to me.

- You got a weird phone call.
- From who?

Some lady from a--
from a rental place.

She said your credit's
been approved.

You can sign your contract on
your studio whenever you want.

Seems like a tight squeeze.
I mean, all of us in one room.

I filled out that application
form before we talked.

There was hardly anything
available on campus,

and it seemed like
a good opportunity.

So you put a deposit down.

I had to for them
to run the credit check.

On a studio apartment.

Okay, I guess I didn't
think it through.

What, have you signed up
for classes already?

Technically, I'm enrolled,
but it's complicated

- 'cause of my deferral.
- Hey!

Now might be a good time
for a little break-o.

So, you're going,
just like that?

Like I said, nothing's final.

But you had
no plans to bring us.

You've been slowly
backing away all along.

Think about it.

Isn't it so much easier
if I get a place over there

and come home on the weekends?

I mean, why uproot
the entire family?

- I can't even believe this.
- It's a four-hour train ride!

For one year,
it's totally doable!

You made the decision
without me,

as if it has
absolutely no effect on us.

Okay, and how is that
any different from what you did

when you decided to become
legal guardian of those kids?

You never once considered
how I'd be affected.

- Those kids are my life.
- No shit, Fiona.

And maybe if you would've
asked me, I woulda said, "yes.

Let's do this together."
But you didn't.

It didn't even
occur to you to ask me.

No, you have known from day one

what you were
getting into with me.

Right, I got sucked
into your world.

I bent to your rules.

I just assumed
that we'd eventually decide

how to move forward together
like couples do,

but there never was "we!"

What have I been doing?

Cooking, cleaning, laundry,
living in a goddamn slum!

Laughs

A slum?

You made me feel
like I could depend on you,

- and now it's a slum?
- Isn't it?

I got robbed at gunpoint
by a 12-year-old girl, Fiona!

Why don't you go find another
fuckin' place to sleep!

A fucking studio!

Whistles

Ahh. Old cigarettes
and skunk piss.

Here.

- Just crusts?
- That's all they had.

Well, what about breakfast?

Son...

I hope you never have to know

what it's like
to not have a home.

They'll get over it.
At least Fiona will.

I wouldn't count on it.

That ornery bitch
can hold a grudge.

People fuck up.
That's life.

Family is supposed
to be forever.

Supposed to take care of you
regardless of what you do.

That's the whole point,
otherwise why bother?

Christ!
Bangs head

There are vermin in here!

I'm your family.

You're right, son.
You haven't let me down.

When I was your age,

my pop took me
on my first heist.

We scored a hi-fi stereo,
about 600 bucks.

Booked a hotel,

blew all the dough
on room service and porn.

This was back
when you had to pay for it.

Man.
Those were the days.

I haven't thought
about that in years.

My foster gays
have a lot of nice stuff.

Your foster gays?

Cassius and Lanier.

Are you suggesting...

what I think you're suggesting?

- What do they got?
- iPods, computers...

- How often they there?
- They work weekends.

- Can you pick a lock?
- I have their security code.

Is that so?

That's all right.

Rock music



 Well, I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you know,
I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you don't forget,
oh, such a spin

 the meanest shake
that I could have ever been

 you know
that I'm struggling

 to pick myself
off the floor

 you know
that I'm struggling

Rise and shine.
We're going camping.

Pack some warm clothes, okay?

Gets cold by the lake at night.

Did you talk to Jimmy
about the studio yet?

No. Let's go.

Knocks on door

Good morning.

Let's go. Up and at 'em.



Good morning, milk dud!

Hey! Hi!
We're going camping!

You want to go camping?
It's so fun.

There's playing,
and singing, and kids.

And there's dirt.
Oh, you love dirt!

Can I do your ears,
or do you still hate that?

My ears.

Where's Jody?

He's at the Wongs',
picking up Hymie.

Do you remember Hymie?

I remember.
The Asian mongoloid.

Actually,
we can call him a retard.

We've earned that right.

Do you want to
spend time with him?

Yes.

Oh, that's wonderful.

He is so special.

You know, I saw this movie
the other day

about babies around the world.

Do you know
that mothers in Africa

wipe their babies' dirty bottoms
on their knees?

- Where's Jody?
- At the Wongs'.

And then they use leaves
to scrape the poop off.

I mean, why not just use
the leaves in the first place?

I don't understand
why they're not

sick all the time over there
with all that bacteria.

Bacteria.

I'm hungry.

I'll make sandwiches
after this.

Where's Jody?

I understand.

Knock on door
Both: Gasp

- Jody.
- Aww.

It's cool, mom, I got this.

Both: Giggle

Okay, we ready?

I can't find the flashlights.

Check the closets.

Yeah, I did, like, three times.

- Where's Carl?
- Said he's not going.

He doesn't feel well.

Oh, you look like garbage.

You sick?

No temperature.

Should we stay home?

- No, I'm not that sick.
- No, no, no, please...

Can we still go?
Liam will be so sad.

Sighs

Okay, but stay in bed.
Drink fluids.

Hey, can you hold him
for a second?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Get my coat on.

Okay.
Enjoy the wedding.

I can't wait
to hear the reports.

Bottles jingle

Jesus, Ian.

What time did you
get in last night?

- 3:00.
- Where were ya?

Out.
Burps

- Ew, gross!
- Okay.

Come on, upstairs.
Sleep it off.

Exhales

Sighs
Will someone please tell me

what the hell is going on
with that kid?

I'm sure he'll tell you
when he's ready.

I hope so.

- Okay, we are off.
- Okay.

Bye.

Bye, Debs.

- Bye!
- Bye!

Bye!

Nurture nature!

We haven't had sex
in over a week.

Yeah, I've, uh...

been a little distracted.

What the fuck?!

- Whatever you do...
- Hey--

Whatever you do...

do not...
do not...

let her bone you.

Hey--
Grunting

You belong here...

with me.

Not with that
fucking vegetable.

Aah!

Panting

Hey, man,
thanks for letting me crash.

Well, you just sorta
showed up, so...

What time did we
crap out last night?

I was in bed by 11:00.

You must have
passed out after 3:00,

'cause that's the last time
I heard the bathroom door slam.

Time five out of five,
each time louder than the last.

Hmm.

I'm-- I'm sorry, man.
I'm a mess.

- I got in this huge fight with--
- With your girlfriend.

We talked about it
for two hours straight.

Oh. Uh, hey,
what time is it?

1:30. I gotta split.
I'm on, uh, afternoon rotation.

You may as well finish that.

This door locks behind you
if you pull it hard,

- which you're awesome at, so...
- Okay.

Exhales

Cell phone beeps

Hey, uh, Kev, it's Lip.

Um...

look, I fucked up.
I, um--

I let her bone me. Just--
Footsteps approaching

call me back as soon
as you get this, all right?

- You okay in there?
- Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah, I'm just, uh,
a little backed up.

For 45 minutes?

Yup.

- Can I get you anything?
- No, please.

I'm-- I'm great. Okay?
I'm fine. Thank you.

I-I-I hate my dress.

I look like a drag queen.

You think Fiona would mind

- if I borrowed one of hers?
- Yes.

- She'd mind, or she'd let me?
- Mind!

Jesus!
Barge right in, why don't you?

What's going on?

I've got a lot
of stuff on my mind.

And you can't
talk to me about it?

No.

What time are you
gonna come tonight?

I don't know, late.
I got some shit I gotta do.

At Karen's?

Errands.

You know what?
Don't bother coming.

Have Nots' All Or None

 Never wanted nothing
other than

 to sing along with you all

 living under the radar

 but now we're
cleaning up the rubble

 from all the shit
we never wanted

 it's the pride in a life that
we never wanted to amount to

 and turned us into

 an indebted and indentured
servant to the human race

 force fed inherited
everything we couldn't take



Work it, Gallagher!
That's right, own that sack!

- Whoo!
- Hey!

What?
How long have you been here?

- Hi. Couple hours.
- Yeah?

Where you been?

Uh, I had to do a meat run.

Yeah, somebody accidentally
left the beef cooler

sitting on the driveway,
and by "someone," I mean me.

- Laughs
- You having fun?

It's my fourth.

Oh, very ni--
I will take that as a yes.

- Where's your peeps?
- Uh...

little redhead
is my sister Debbie,

and the little, brown baby
with the boogers

is my brother Liam.

Laughs
Nice, nice. Is that it?

Uh, yeah,
my brother Carl's sick,

my brother Ian has a hangover,

and my other brother Lip
had that wedding.

Gotcha, gotcha.

Where's your man?

Laughs Is that cup a perk?

Or did you
have to pay for that?

Hey, don't hate
'cause I get swag.

- Ah...
- Okay? I'm a full-timer.

Mm-hmm.

If you weren't
moving to Michigan,

- maybe you'd pull cups too.
- Well, shit.

How can I go now knowing that?

Well, shit,
I don't think you can.

Cheers.
Chuckles

Hey. Hop in.

I'll give you a ride.

Nando! Hey, wow!
When did you get here?

Early.

You f--

flew all the way from Brazil?

Miami.

I was there on business.

I'm ravenous.
We go eat?

Rock music

 She brought it down
from the big, big hill

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

 placed it
on your windowsill

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

 that cobra's
in the cave with you

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

You call me a punk for wanting
a boyfriend or whatever,

but you're gonna marry someone
who screws guys for a living?

Who gives a shit?

It's a fucking piece of paper.

Not to me.

Scoffs

Hey, come on-- look.

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean
we can't still bang.

Okay?

All right?

If you give half a shit
about me, Mickey--

Hey, hey.

Half.

Don't do this.

And these stairs
lead to the side room,

and this is the hallway
to the bedroom.

This is the outside deck.

The living room, the kitchen,

the other bedroom,
and the front room.

My God, how big is this place?

- Big.
- Bastards.

There's no more marshmallows.

I hate that.

They give you, like,
ten in the whole bag.

- What if they catch us?
- Visualize success.

What if they dust
for fingerprints?

Always wear gloves.
Got one. Chuckles

It's a treasure chest.
That's a good omen.

What about DNA testing?

Nobody bothers with that
CSIcrap, not on a burglary.

Cops'll see these faggots,
they won't give three wet farts.

Are you with me?

Hmm.

Okay, one, two, three, go.

Eh, we'll get it next time.

Mmm.

You haven't taken
one bite, Steve.

All this food going to waste.

Mmm.

Now, tell me...

I hear reports of, um,
medical school.

Uh, going back in January.

I'm gonna become
a dermatologist or a surgeon.

Good.

Cosmetic surgery's
a rich field.

Very lucrative.
Much potential.

Indeed.

And this would require
a move to another state.

Only temporary. I'm-- I'm still
working out the details.

You know,
I-I really just want to do

what's best for everyone.

Well, it sounds like
you want to do

what's best for yourself.

Uh, but having a doctor
husband for Estefania

would be a great thing.

You know, in America,
doctors are seen as heroes.

I'm familiar with your culture.

But the point
being is it's--

it's all good, you know?
Ann Arbor's a great town.

There's lots of shops.

Mm.

And when was the last time
you've seen my daughter?

Uh, two days ago.

Why?

I saw her three hours ago.

In INS Holding.

I suppose you're not aware
she's being deported.

Wait, why? Why--

You missed an INS visit
yesterday, Steve.

Why didn't she call me?

Well, she tried.
You didn't pick up.

And she failed to impress
the authorities.

Didn't even know your birthday.

My birthday is Christmas!
How hard is that to remember?

And your mother's name.

This is my fault?
We did-- we did flash cards.

I can't be with her
every second.

Sighs I ask
so little of you, Steve.

So little.

Stay out of trouble.

Be attentive to my daughter.

Her presence in this country
is controversial.

You understand that.

We were under a microscope.
I thought I made that clear.

Look, I'm so sorry
this happened,

I just don't know what could've
been done to prevent it.

That's precisely
the problem, isn't it, Steve?

What now?

Well, what's done
cannot be undone.

Now I must grease many palms.

It will be dealt with.

People cheering, chattering

Wait, so you're telling me

you've never
been to a strip club?

No. Just the thought
of a lap dance

actually makes me woozy.

- Laughs
- Like, do I grope?

If-- how do I go about doing that
in, like, a non-offensive way?

Like, do I make eye contact,
or is that--

that could be insulting,
'cause I mean,

she works so hard on her body.

Wow, you really are
a gentleman.

I am hardly a gentleman.

I just have a problem
with forced intimacy.

Blame my mother.

Your mom was a stripper?

Mm-hmm.
Laughs

Still a stripper, by the way.

Clears throat 90 years old.

Takes her like 40 minutes
to unhook her bra,

but when she does, what a show.

Laughs

So, uh...

we sorta ditched the party.

Yeah, we sorta did.

I'm gonna make
three assumptions.

Fire away.

Okay, one,
you're as drunk as I am.

- Correct. Shh.
- Laughs

Two, you're as cold as I am.

Colder. Less padding.

I'm gonna ignore that.

- Sighs
- Three...

you're a gentleman.

False.

Quite the opposite.

Hmm.

Well, then you better
behave yourself,

because I am way too drunk
not to invite you

back to my tent right now.

God damn, Gallagher.

I oughta get you
pissed off more often.

So, what are we gonna do?

We gonna
tell everyone to leave?

Nah.

I'll go get
this shit over with,

and, uh, you can
wait here for me.

Shouldn't take
more than an hour, right?

You better be ready
for round two.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Why are you acting
like I got a choice in this?

This is bullshit.

Listen to me, Mickey.

Your dad is an evil,
psychotic prick.

You're just gonna
let him ruin your life?

You need to grow the fuck up.

Don't act like you know
a thing about my dad.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Not everybody
gets to just--

not everybody just gets to

blurt out how they fuckin' feel
every minute.

Footsteps approaching

Everyone's looking for you.

I'm having a fuckin' smoke.
Is that all right?

You just get here?

Yeah.

I didn't know you were coming.

Last-minute decision.

Come on.

 Dead man walking
like a wind-up toy

 plodding, never plotting for
the things that bring him joy

 living in the movies
like he's celluloid

 and then it's over

 so roll the credits now

 dead man standing
single file in every line

 gave up on the searching

 he was scared
of what he'd find

 but I don't wanna live
like I'm headed to the grave

 no, I don't wanna
live that way

 got a purpose and a plan

 and I don't wanna live
like a dead man



Both: Panting, moaning

Ah!

What, what?
You okay?

What am I doing?
What am I doing?

Do you want to stop?
We can stop.

- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

We got carried away, all right?
These things happen.

I don't know what I'm doing.

You're using me for revenge.

Am I?

I'm not saying that I mind.
I-I-I do not mind.

I just recognize the impulse.

He was planning on
going to Michigan without me.

Oh, shit.

He acted like he was
gonna take all of us,

but it's not even
the first time that he's lied.

I closed my stupid eyes to it

'cause I wanted it
to work so bad.

Your eyes aren't stupid.

Sighs Oh, I'm an idiot.

Just because
someone dumps on you

does not mean you deserve it.

Tell me that
when someone's dumping on you.

Eve?

That's my wife.

Ex-wife. God.

Papers went through last week.

I'm kinda too chicken
to get it removed,

so I'm thinking about
making it into a bigger word.

- Chuckles
- Like, uh...

"Sleeve" maybe.
Laughs

"Eleven."
I don't know.

Both: Laugh

I guess you're lucky
her name wasn't "Ocksucker."

Both: Laugh

Yeah.

Yeah.

When did you know
when it was over?

When she started
going to the gym every day.

Sighs You?

Without a hitch.

Son, you did good.

Whispers Close the door.
Close the door.

How much you think
it's all worth?

I don't know.
Maybe 3 grand?

- Really?
- Damn straight.

Hey, let's celebrate.

Go cook us up some spaghettios.

Lis-- listen, I know
that I got sloppy, Nando,

but I will fix it.
Just tell me what I can do.

Run-- run drugs,
steal cars,

you know, my dad has connections
in the government.

He's a powerful man.

He supported
immigration legislation--

So much traffic today.
Are the cubs playing?

It's-- you know what?

It's a good thing
this happened, actually.

I mean, not entirely,
of course,

but I-I'm completely clear
on the rules.

You know, I'm absolutely
on the same page as you.

I mean, thank you for that.
Truly. Truly.

Oh, let's go see who that is.

Oh, hey!

I'm just finishing up
Karen's favorite snack.

Snickerdoodle cupcakes.

She's upstairs.

Um, but hey, um, you don't need

to install the motion lights

because Jody is taking
Karen and Hymie to Sedona

to live near
the vortexes, so...

It's fine.
They're gonna be near family.

And she is his wife, after all.

Is-- is Mrs. Wong
okay with Hymie leaving?

Well, she's his mother,

and babies belong
with their mothers, so...

You go on up.
I'll be right there with snacks.

Chuckles

Hey.

How you feeling?

Exhales

Your mom says you're moving.

I am?

Yeah, to Arizona?

Oh.

The Grand Canyon.

Cactuses.

Right.

Hey...

I know you're in there.
It's just us now, okay?

We can talk.

Hey, uh...

you remember that day

we, uh-- we got drunk

and, uh,
ran around Lincoln Park

setting off all the alarms
on the Priuses?

Yeah.

And then we, um--

we climbed the Lincoln statue

and gave Old Abe some, uh,
lipstick with red sharpie.

Yeah... yeah.

Yeah, you were, uh,
fucking fearless.

And a total shithead.

I remember, um, you made me
go down on you that night

in the bathroom of Bennigan's.

You remember all that?

Yes.

But...

I can't feel.

Feel what?

Stuff.

Inside.

I, uh...

I don't know what that means.

I can't explain.

But...

it's okay.

Are there snacks?

Mandy.
Mandy did this. Okay?

Mandy hit you with the car
and fucked you up forever!

All right?
Because of me.

Mandy Milkovich.

Yes.

Do you understand me?

- Yes.
- Okay.

Do you know who hit you?

No.

Are there snacks?

 Lady in red

People chattering

 is dancing with me

 cheek to cheek

 there's nobody here

Mandy!

Come here.

Laughs
Couldn't stay away, could you?

You ruined Karen's life!

You're a jealous,
demented cunt, Mandy!

Seriously!

All right? We're done!

I did it for you, you prick.

I did everything for you,
but you're so fucking blind.

You know what, don't sweat it.

We were done
before you got here.

This is Kenyatta.

He's my date.

I just swallowed his load
in the bathroom.

Can you taste it?

He did it.

He got married.
To a woman.

I told you
not to come here, okay?

You try sitting on your ass
while the person you love--

No, I'm sorry, I mean
the guy you've been fucking

gets married
to some random commie skank!

Fuckin' commie!

 You were amazing

 never seen
so many people--

Let's go.

Get out of the car.

Sniffles

Okay.

Be a man.
Just this once.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Deep breath.

- Breathes deeply
- Chin up.

Get onto the boat.

Can I just make
one phone call to Fiona?

Please?

Cell phone splashes Fuck.

Engine growling

I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

We're so close.

I gotta lay down
for a little bit.

Ian, hey, stop.
No! We're here!

I'm gonna puke.

Police radios

We know you've been stealing...

Fuck.

- Kid, settle down.
- Hey, whoa, can I help you?

Who are you?

I'm his brother.
What's going on?

We have reason
to believe this child

may have robbed
his former foster parents

while they were
at work this afternoon.

Yeah?
What proof you got?

He had a special security code
assigned to him.

He's the only one
that knows it.

All right, as far as I can
tell, that's not evidence.

Get your fuckin'
hands off him, man.

His code was a series
of four letters.

C-A-R-L.

Take your fuckin' hands
off him, man!

He's just a fucking kid!

All right,
that's enough of that.

Step back, sir.

Take your hands
off the officer right now!

Step away from the officer.

It's gonna be okay.

This kid stole
from people, all right?

- We're taking him in.
- You're ta-- he's a fucking kid!

Do not touch the officer.

- Step back right now!
- Carl, come here!

If you interfere again,
I will arrest you!

Do not touch him!

Why are you being
so rough with him?

You are gonna have to--

Why is he being
so fucking rough with him?

You touch him again,
I will arrest you!

Whoa, whoa.
Good evening, gentlemen.

- Are you the parent?
- Why, yes, I am.

What the fuck
are you doing here, Frank?

I'm coming home.

We're taking your son
in for questioning.

He didn't do the heist, I did.

You see?
Shiny, but a little bit big.

I also got a boatload
of electronics-- those sold fast.

Did you know that Chicago
has several 24-hour pawn shops?

He-- he didn't--
he's innocent.

I forced him
to give me the code.

Didn't I?
Son, tell 'em.

Oh, my God.
He's dumber than a bag of hair.

He couldn't pull off a band-aid,
much less a robbery.

Okay, here.

We're celebrating Fiona's
impending marriage to a doctor.

Oh, wow. Really?

- You can come with me.
- To Michigan?

Good luck
convincing her to move.

Fiona?

Estefania, dammit, your wife.

A man has few things
of real value in this life.

His family.
The value of his word.

Are you a man of your word?

You don't live here anymore.

You still someone I can trust?

Mickey getting married.
Does that make sense to you?

She works at Garden Spring Spa,

if you call jerking off
random dudes "working."

Terry made Mickey fuck her
to fuck the gay out of 'em.

I know what he felt with me.

You can't fake that.

- What'd you hit?
- Girl at school.

I wasn't very nice to Karen.

She was so happy
when she got that text from you.

Text?

The night of the accident
when she came to meet you.

You're taking Mandy
for granted.

She's kind.
She's devoted.

She's not someone
whose feelings you can ignore.

Should we be
planning for the worst?

I've seen miracles.
They do happen.

Keep engaging her.

Let her know you're here.

This whole Ann Arbor thing--

we can make it work.

Been doing some research.

Worldwide Cup
has an office in Canton

only 18 miles from campus.

- Wow.
- I know, right?

I'm gonna see
if they need help.

And the public schools there

are a hell of a lot better.

I called a couple.

They actually
answered the phone.

They said that Debbie and Carl
could transfer mid-year.

They're so nice about it.

I just don't want
the kids resenting me

for making them
leave their friends at school.

What friends?
Lip's graduating.

I'm not sure what to do
about Ian yet,

but I'll ask him
when he's feeling better.

- And the house?
- Sublet it, maybe.

I don't know yet.

Wow. I mean,
you've really turned a corner.

Chuckles Yeah.

- Morning.
- Mm.

You never
came to bed last night.

Yeah, no, sorry,
I got sucked into, um...

Zambian women's boxing.

Muscular women
make me feel funny.

Sounds hot.

Can you hurry up and get ready?

I want to get to school early.

Gonna swipe
some bags of tater tots

from the cafeteria
for Mickey's wedding.

Okay, I'll be right up.

Late start this morning, guys.

- Sorry, you're on your own.
- Oh, thanks, Debs.

We're out of peanut butter.

Is Ian staying home
from school again today?

Yes, he is.
His stomach is still messed up.

- Any more pop tarts left?
- Carl finished them.

- He ate three.
- I'm a growing boy.

"Little Broski" took a big-boy
dump on the big-boy toilet!

Hey! Mwah!

We're gonna celebrate
by walking to the store

for some butt wipes.

And peanut butter
and pop tarts.

And tampons. Sorry.

And make sure he wears a hat.
It's getting cold.

- Tampons.
- Bye, family!

Bye, Fiona!
Butch it up, dude.

Dude.

You gotta get up at some point.

I'm losing my mind. I--

I can't stop thinking
about the wedding.

Stay as far away from that
car wreck as humanly possible.

Okay?
It's not worth it.

Can you help me set up
this afternoon at the VFW?

Uh, no, you know what?
I promised I'd go to Sheila's.

You know,
Karen's getting home tonight.

- Gotta help set up.
- I'll help.

- You sure?
- Yeah.

Hey, wait, dude,
aren't you sick?

I don't get why Jody and Sheila

can't set up
Karen's shit by themselves.

Look, she needs
a lot of stuff, okay?

She can't even
walk by herself yet.

She's got frontal lobe damage.

The dude who hit her

probably doesn't even
have a scratch on him.

go there last night?

I was on my way there

when I sat down here
and accidentally fell asleep.

Bullshit. You look like a bum,
you smell like a bum.

I'm a passenger.

Get off my lawn.

All right!

I'm going!

To my house, where I live,

I have labeled
the quarterly reports

from the last four years

with color-coded tabs,
stapled and collated.

And I've included double-sided
copies for the archive.

Oh, dang, maestro.

I was wondering
if you knew of any positions

opening up
in your Michigan office.

Uh, I could ask.
You leaving us?

My boyfriend might be
going to med school at U of M.

We're not sure yet.

Wow. That's terrific.

We'll be sad to see you go.

Me too.

Uh, sorry.

I don't know
if you're busy this weekend,

but my family has a cabin.

It's like a half an hour drive
north of here.

We go every year
during the fall,

we camp,
and toast marshmallows,

and kinda drink our faces off.

Uh...

Shit, so--

I'm doing this really,
really badly.

I am totally
inviting both of you

and the pile of kids you brought
to the softball game.

Real-- they'd have a great time.
How many are there total?

Two teens, two preteens,
and a toddler.

Perfect, I mean,
we've got extra tents,

we've got sub-zero
sleeping bags,

the little ones share a tent,

tell ghost stories,
while the adults

just get blitzed by the fire.

And I mean, tons of people
from work usually come.

It's great.

Sounds good.

My brothers
might have a wedding,

but I'll check
with the rest of the gang.

Yeah, cool. Let me know.

Okay.

- Whoa, are they there now?
- Who?

- The INS.
- No.

Then why are you calling me?

I have this stupid shoe
I bought, and it break.

And I tried to call to complain,
but they don't understand me.

You call, yeah?

No, Estefania,
this number's for emergencies.

I'm bored, Steve.

All I do, I sit here
with textbooks, go shopping,

I get bad sex with horny boys
with tiny pintinhos.

Okay, okay.

I will go to the store later.

- Come over.
- Okay, okay.

Gotta go.
Here, here, here.

Phone plays pig oinking
What's that? What's that, Liam?

Is that a piggy? A filthy,
snorting bacon machine?

Oinks

Wow. Can you do
cows and chickens too?

Not as good as your mom.

I have your mail.

Cable, utility, rent.
Your checkbook. Sign?

I have personal things
for you as well.

TV guide, architectural di--
anthropologie.

Is that for girls?

I also have this.

University of Michigan
enrollment notification.

Classes begin in January?

You opened my mail?
That's a felony.

So you were able
to convince Estefania to move?

It's-- um--

it's a work in progress.
I'm working on it. Just don't--

Ah, but Fiona's
aware of your plans, I assume.

You're getting careless.

Don't.

Door opens Hey.

Hey. Uh...
Clears throat

bad time?

No, just putting together
some baby stuff way prematurely.

- Chuckles
- What's up?

Um, I need your advice.

Well, if it's about infants,
college, or tiny dicks,

I'm the wrong guy.

Uh, no, it's, um--

it's about crazy.
You were married to once.

Why, is Mandy going
a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran over
Karen with her car.

What?

I think she-- she ran over
Karen with her car,

and also she-- she carries this
like huge stockpile of arms--

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

Your current girlfriend

ran over your ex-girlfriend
with a car?

Signs point to yes.
I mean, I--

I don't know. I don't know
what she's capable of.

Dude, you're at DEFCON 1.

You need to get
the fuck outta there.

Tell me how.

Very slowly.

You need to make her think
it's her idea.

Keep your distance.

Because once they get
behind the wheel,

there's no going back.

Okay. I mean, I'm--
I'm-- I'm gone a lot, you know?

They need a lot of help
over at Karen's, so--

Whoa, whoa, Lip, wait, wait.

Does Mandy know
you're going over there?

Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I told her--

- Lip, you can't
tell her that shit!

That's like waving the flag
in front of the bull!

- Well--
- Hide the car keys,

stop showering,
and you tell her nothing.

And whatever you do,
do not-- Lip.

Do not let her bone you,

because that oxytocin stuff
makes them adhesive.

You got it?

Yeah.

I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

- Fiona and Lip will be mad.
- Well, of course they will.

They treat me like a leper
because I'm "a bad father."

Yeah, right.

Tell you, you haven't
seen bad parenting

till you witness my mother
in her glory days.

Had this piece of wood
she called a retribution stick.

Flat side, skinny side.

If I did something small,
like steal an extra cookie

or piss in her shampoo bottle--
whack. Flat side.

But if I did something heinous,

like set fire to her bed
when she was napping,

or rat her out for her
garage gambling ring,

the skinny side.

Like a whip.

Whack! Whack!
Whack, whack, whack!

Whack! Whack!

Whack! But did I
throw that bitch

into the gutter
when she needed a home? No.

I brushed her hair.
I washed her saggy tits.

I irrigated her ulcers.

I nursed her
all the way to the grave.

But you people, making me
homeless in the dead of autumn?

After I got you through cancer?

I slept on a train last night!

Cool. Can I try that?

No! It's barbaric.
I have no place to go!

Do you get it?

I could sneak you
in the van tonight.

You'd do that for me?

You little piker, you.

You made it.

Chairs are over here,
and watch out for splinters.

You know, um,
Lip is still up Karen's ass.

It's getting old.

Yeah.

So, Svetlana.
She like, uh--

She's quiet.

And skinny, which is weird,

'cause he usually
bags fat chicks.

I do his laundry.

I apply to colleges for him,
and what the hell does Karen do?

Drools and farts.
I mean, come on.

Think he loves her?

She's brain-dead.

- I mean Mickey.
- I dunno.

Tons of guys
get chicks knocked up

and don't get hitched, so...

Dad's super excited.
Planned the whole thing.

Invited his buds
from the gun club.

It's kind of sweet.

Chair clatters

Phone playing animal sounds

Hey, look what I
stole from work.

Three cheers
for Captain Cappuccino.

Take some cream
with that hostility?

Oh, no, it's fine,
just whisk my best friend off

when I'm about to have a baby,
no biggie.

Whoa,
we're telling people already?

Not "people." Just V.

And Mike from work, who says
he'll look into transferring me.

Oh, don't get
your panties in a wad.

I know how
to keep my mouth shut.

Look, I'm happy for you.
I'm just sad for me.

Oh... don't worry,

we'll come visit
your li'l peanut once a month.

Or you could come stay with us.
Cell phone ringing

I found a couple four and five
bedroom houses online today.

Cheaper than Chicago.

Pizza!

Come get it while it's hot!

- Pizza!
- Pepperoni!

How was school?

We did fractions today.

Chew your food like a human.
Phone whinnies

So, Mike from the office

is planning this big
camping trip this weekend,

and we're all invited.

You wanna go?

- Yeah! Can we make s'mores?
- Uh-huh.

- And shoot raccoons?
- No.

Interested?

Love camping in theory,
except for the bugs,

and the dirt,
and the ground-sleeping.

But yeah, sounds great.

Mwah.

Well, caffeine addicts await.

Bye-bye, Dr. Jim.

So...

Sighs

you guys know
how Jimmy's thinking about

maybe going back to med school?

- Mm-hmm.
- No.

Okay, well,

if he does,

it would be in Michigan.

He'd leave us?

Or we'd go with him.

Maybe.

To Michigan.
What about school?

Well, it'll only be for a year.

And nothing's decided.

I just want you
to start thinking about it.

What about Frank?
We can't leave him here.

- Of course we can.
- But it's getting cold.

His thick layer of bullshit
will keep him warm.

Cell phone ringing

Laughs Mm.

Hello?

Jimmy's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

Oh, wow, where is it?

How many bathrooms?

A studio?

I will pass that on.

Who was that?

Ann Arbor Rentals.

The application
Jimmy put in went through.

What's a studio?

It's a one-room apartment,
Debs.

I thought you said
it wasn't decided yet.

How are we all
gonna fit in one room?

Door opens

They're here!
They're here!

They're here!

They're here!
Gasps

Welcome home!
Welcome home!

Look at you, sweet girl!

I'm gonna go grab her stuff.

Look at you.
You look so much better.

Oh, my gosh, the color's
back in your cheeks.

Are you happy to be home?

Yes. I--

This place is nice.
I remember.

Aw...

Hi, Lip.

Hi.

I-I'm, um...

I'm sorry we didn't
install the rails outside.

It's just been so wet.

Um, are you hungry?
I made smoothies.

I'll get you some.

Door opens, closes

Here we go.

What is this?

It's a smoothie.

Slurping

Ahh...

I like the cold on my throat.

And the tongue-taste.

What is this?

Well, it's a smoothie.

- Right.
- Oh.

Inhales

Mm, good night.

What did Dr. Ron
say about this?

She still has
most of her old memories,

she just can't form
any new ones.

Got some pamphlets
from the hospital.

Yeah, thanks.

Um, when's it go away?

Everyone's different, you know?

Could be permanent,
but I say we keep hope alive.

I got family down in Sedona.

They have
healing vortexes out there.

Alternative treatments
and stuff.

Oh, she just got home.

We don't know
what she needs yet.

She seems nicer though.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You left your phone at home.

You didn't have to come down
here to bring it to me.

- You got a weird phone call.
- From who?

Some lady from a--
from a rental place.

She said your credit's
been approved.

You can sign your contract on
your studio whenever you want.

Seems like a tight squeeze.
I mean, all of us in one room.

I filled out that application
form before we talked.

There was hardly anything
available on campus,

and it seemed like
a good opportunity.

So you put a deposit down.

I had to for them
to run the credit check.

On a studio apartment.

Okay, I guess I didn't
think it through.

What, have you signed up
for classes already?

Technically, I'm enrolled,
but it's complicated

- 'cause of my deferral.
- Hey!

Now might be a good time
for a little break-o.

So, you're going,
just like that?

Like I said, nothing's final.

But you had
no plans to bring us.

You've been slowly
backing away all along.

Think about it.

Isn't it so much easier
if I get a place over there

and come home on the weekends?

I mean, why uproot
the entire family?

- I can't even believe this.
- It's a four-hour train ride!

For one year,
it's totally doable!

You made the decision
without me,

as if it has
absolutely no effect on us.

Okay, and how is that
any different from what you did

when you decided to become
legal guardian of those kids?

You never once considered
how I'd be affected.

- Those kids are my life.
- No shit, Fiona.

And maybe if you would've
asked me, I woulda said, "yes.

Let's do this together."
But you didn't.

It didn't even
occur to you to ask me.

No, you have known from day one

what you were
getting into with me.

Right, I got sucked
into your world.

I bent to your rules.

I just assumed
that we'd eventually decide

how to move forward together
like couples do,

but there never was "we!"

What have I been doing?

Cooking, cleaning, laundry,
living in a goddamn slum!

Laughs

A slum?

You made me feel
like I could depend on you,

- and now it's a slum?
- Isn't it?

I got robbed at gunpoint
by a 12-year-old girl, Fiona!

Why don't you go find another
fuckin' place to sleep!

A fucking studio!

Whistles

Ahh. Old cigarettes
and skunk piss.

Here.

- Just crusts?
- That's all they had.

Well, what about breakfast?

Son...

I hope you never have to know

what it's like
to not have a home.

They'll get over it.
At least Fiona will.

I wouldn't count on it.

That ornery bitch
can hold a grudge.

People fuck up.
That's life.

Family is supposed
to be forever.

Supposed to take care of you
regardless of what you do.

That's the whole point,
otherwise why bother?

Christ!
Bangs head

There are vermin in here!

I'm your family.

You're right, son.
You haven't let me down.

When I was your age,

my pop took me
on my first heist.

We scored a hi-fi stereo,
about 600 bucks.

Booked a hotel,

blew all the dough
on room service and porn.

This was back
when you had to pay for it.

Man.
Those were the days.

I haven't thought
about that in years.

My foster gays
have a lot of nice stuff.

Your foster gays?

Cassius and Lanier.

Are you suggesting...

what I think you're suggesting?

- What do they got?
- iPods, computers...

- How often they there?
- They work weekends.

- Can you pick a lock?
- I have their security code.

Is that so?

That's all right.

Rock music



 Well, I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you know,
I can't stand still

 you got me in a spin

 you don't forget,
oh, such a spin

 the meanest shake
that I could have ever been

 you know
that I'm struggling

 to pick myself
off the floor

 you know
that I'm struggling

Rise and shine.
We're going camping.

Pack some warm clothes, okay?

Gets cold by the lake at night.

Did you talk to Jimmy
about the studio yet?

No. Let's go.

Knocks on door

Good morning.

Let's go. Up and at 'em.



Good morning, milk dud!

Hey! Hi!
We're going camping!

You want to go camping?
It's so fun.

There's playing,
and singing, and kids.

And there's dirt.
Oh, you love dirt!

Can I do your ears,
or do you still hate that?

My ears.

Where's Jody?

He's at the Wongs',
picking up Hymie.

Do you remember Hymie?

I remember.
The Asian mongoloid.

Actually,
we can call him a retard.

We've earned that right.

Do you want to
spend time with him?

Yes.

Oh, that's wonderful.

He is so special.

You know, I saw this movie
the other day

about babies around the world.

Do you know
that mothers in Africa

wipe their babies' dirty bottoms
on their knees?

- Where's Jody?
- At the Wongs'.

And then they use leaves
to scrape the poop off.

I mean, why not just use
the leaves in the first place?

I don't understand
why they're not

sick all the time over there
with all that bacteria.

Bacteria.

I'm hungry.

I'll make sandwiches
after this.

Where's Jody?

I understand.

Knock on door
Both: Gasp

- Jody.
- Aww.

It's cool, mom, I got this.

Both: Giggle

Okay, we ready?

I can't find the flashlights.

Check the closets.

Yeah, I did, like, three times.

- Where's Carl?
- Said he's not going.

He doesn't feel well.

Oh, you look like garbage.

You sick?

No temperature.

Should we stay home?

- No, I'm not that sick.
- No, no, no, please...

Can we still go?
Liam will be so sad.

Sighs

Okay, but stay in bed.
Drink fluids.

Hey, can you hold him
for a second?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Get my coat on.

Okay.
Enjoy the wedding.

I can't wait
to hear the reports.

Bottles jingle

Jesus, Ian.

What time did you
get in last night?

- 3:00.
- Where were ya?

Out.
Burps

- Ew, gross!
- Okay.

Come on, upstairs.
Sleep it off.

Exhales

Sighs
Will someone please tell me

what the hell is going on
with that kid?

I'm sure he'll tell you
when he's ready.

I hope so.

- Okay, we are off.
- Okay.

Bye.

Bye, Debs.

- Bye!
- Bye!

Bye!

Nurture nature!

We haven't had sex
in over a week.

Yeah, I've, uh...

been a little distracted.

What the fuck?!

- Whatever you do...
- Hey--

Whatever you do...

do not...
do not...

let her bone you.

Hey--
Grunting

You belong here...

with me.

Not with that
fucking vegetable.

Aah!

Panting

Hey, man,
thanks for letting me crash.

Well, you just sorta
showed up, so...

What time did we
crap out last night?

I was in bed by 11:00.

You must have
passed out after 3:00,

'cause that's the last time
I heard the bathroom door slam.

Time five out of five,
each time louder than the last.

Hmm.

I'm-- I'm sorry, man.
I'm a mess.

- I got in this huge fight with--
- With your girlfriend.

We talked about it
for two hours straight.

Oh. Uh, hey,
what time is it?

1:30. I gotta split.
I'm on, uh, afternoon rotation.

You may as well finish that.

This door locks behind you
if you pull it hard,

- which you're awesome at, so...
- Okay.

Exhales

Cell phone beeps

Hey, uh, Kev, it's Lip.

Um...

look, I fucked up.
I, um--

I let her bone me. Just--
Footsteps approaching

call me back as soon
as you get this, all right?

- You okay in there?
- Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah, I'm just, uh,
a little backed up.

For 45 minutes?

Yup.

- Can I get you anything?
- No, please.

I'm-- I'm great. Okay?
I'm fine. Thank you.

I-I-I hate my dress.

I look like a drag queen.

You think Fiona would mind

- if I borrowed one of hers?
- Yes.

- She'd mind, or she'd let me?
- Mind!

Jesus!
Barge right in, why don't you?

What's going on?

I've got a lot
of stuff on my mind.

And you can't
talk to me about it?

No.

What time are you
gonna come tonight?

I don't know, late.
I got some shit I gotta do.

At Karen's?

Errands.

You know what?
Don't bother coming.

Have Nots' All Or None

 Never wanted nothing
other than

 to sing along with you all

 living under the radar

 but now we're
cleaning up the rubble

 from all the shit
we never wanted

 it's the pride in a life that
we never wanted to amount to

 and turned us into

 an indebted and indentured
servant to the human race

 force fed inherited
everything we couldn't take



Work it, Gallagher!
That's right, own that sack!

- Whoo!
- Hey!

What?
How long have you been here?

- Hi. Couple hours.
- Yeah?

Where you been?

Uh, I had to do a meat run.

Yeah, somebody accidentally
left the beef cooler

sitting on the driveway,
and by "someone," I mean me.

- Laughs
- You having fun?

It's my fourth.

Oh, very ni--
I will take that as a yes.

- Where's your peeps?
- Uh...

little redhead
is my sister Debbie,

and the little, brown baby
with the boogers

is my brother Liam.

Laughs
Nice, nice. Is that it?

Uh, yeah,
my brother Carl's sick,

my brother Ian has a hangover,

and my other brother Lip
had that wedding.

Gotcha, gotcha.

Where's your man?

Laughs Is that cup a perk?

Or did you
have to pay for that?

Hey, don't hate
'cause I get swag.

- Ah...
- Okay? I'm a full-timer.

Mm-hmm.

If you weren't
moving to Michigan,

- maybe you'd pull cups too.
- Well, shit.

How can I go now knowing that?

Well, shit,
I don't think you can.

Cheers.
Chuckles

Hey. Hop in.

I'll give you a ride.

Nando! Hey, wow!
When did you get here?

Early.

You f--

flew all the way from Brazil?

Miami.

I was there on business.

I'm ravenous.
We go eat?

Rock music

 She brought it down
from the big, big hill

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

 placed it

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

 that cobra's

 shine your diamonds,
shine 'em, shine 'em

You call me a punk for wanting
a boyfriend or whatever,

but you're gonna marry someone
who screws guys for a living?

Who gives a shit?

It's a fucking piece of paper.

Not to me.

Scoffs

Hey, come on-- look.

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean
we can't still bang.

Okay?

All right?

If you give half a shit
about me, Mickey--

Hey, hey.

Half.

Don't do this.

And these stairs
lead to the side room,

and this is the hallway
to the bedroom.

This is the outside deck.

The living room, the kitchen,

the other bedroom,
and the front room.

My God, how big is this place?

- Big.
- Bastards.

There's no more marshmallows.

I hate that.

They give you, like,
ten in the whole bag.

- What if they catch us?
- Visualize success.

What if they dust
for fingerprints?

Always wear gloves.
Got one. Chuckles

It's a treasure chest.
That's a good omen.

What about DNA testing?

Nobody bothers with that
CSIcrap, not on a burglary.

Cops'll see these faggots,
they won't give three wet farts.

Are you with me?

Hmm.

Okay, one, two, three, go.

Eh, we'll get it next time.

Mmm.

You haven't taken
one bite, Steve.

All this food going to waste.

Mmm.

Now, tell me...

I hear reports of, um,
medical school.

Uh, going back in January.

I'm gonna become
a dermatologist or a surgeon.

Good.

Cosmetic surgery's
a rich field.

Very lucrative.
Much potential.

Indeed.

And this would require
a move to another state.

Only temporary. I'm-- I'm still
working out the details.

You know,
I-I really just want to do

what's best for everyone.

Well, it sounds like
you want to do

what's best for yourself.

Uh, but having a doctor
husband for Estefania

would be a great thing.

You know, in America,
doctors are seen as heroes.

I'm familiar with your culture.

But the point
being is it's--

it's all good, you know?
Ann Arbor's a great town.

There's lots of shops.

Mm.

And when was the last time
you've seen my daughter?

Uh, two days ago.

Why?

I saw her three hours ago.

In INS Holding.

I suppose you're not aware
she's being deported.

Wait, why? Why--

You missed an INS visit
yesterday, Steve.

Why didn't she call me?

Well, she tried.
You didn't pick up.

And she failed to impress
the authorities.

Didn't even know your birthday.

My birthday is Christmas!
How hard is that to remember?

And your mother's name.

This is my fault?
We did-- we did flash cards.

I can't be with her
every second.

Sighs I ask
so little of you, Steve.

So little.

Stay out of trouble.

Be attentive to my daughter.

Her presence in this country
is controversial.

You understand that.

We were under a microscope.
I thought I made that clear.

Look, I'm so sorry
this happened,

I just don't know what could've
been done to prevent it.

That's precisely
the problem, isn't it, Steve?

What now?

Well, what's done
cannot be undone.

Now I must grease many palms.

It will be dealt with.

People cheering, chattering

Wait, so you're telling me

you've never
been to a strip club?

No. Just the thought
of a lap dance

actually makes me woozy.

- Laughs
- Like, do I grope?

If-- how do I go about doing that
in, like, a non-offensive way?

Like, do I make eye contact,
or is that--

that could be insulting,
'cause I mean,

she works so hard on her body.

Wow, you really are
a gentleman.

I am hardly a gentleman.

I just have a problem
with forced intimacy.

Blame my mother.

Your mom was a stripper?

Mm-hmm.
Laughs

Still a stripper, by the way.

Clears throat 90 years old.

Takes her like 40 minutes
to unhook her bra,

but when she does, what a show.

Laughs

So, uh...

we sorta ditched the party.

Yeah, we sorta did.

I'm gonna make
three assumptions.

Fire away.

Okay, one,
you're as drunk as I am.

- Correct. Shh.
- Laughs

Two, you're as cold as I am.

Colder. Less padding.

I'm gonna ignore that.

- Sighs
- Three...

you're a gentleman.

False.

Quite the opposite.

Hmm.

Well, then you better
behave yourself,

because I am way too drunk
not to invite you

back to my tent right now.

God damn, Gallagher.

I oughta get you
pissed off more often.

So, what are we gonna do?

We gonna
tell everyone to leave?

Nah.

I'll go get
this shit over with,

and, uh, you can
wait here for me.

Shouldn't take
more than an hour, right?

You better be ready
for round two.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Why are you acting
like I got a choice in this?

This is bullshit.

Listen to me, Mickey.

Your dad is an evil,
psychotic prick.

You're just gonna
let him ruin your life?

You need to grow the fuck up.

Don't act like you know
a thing about my dad.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Not everybody
gets to just--

not everybody just gets to

blurt out how they fuckin' feel
every minute.

Footsteps approaching

Everyone's looking for you.

I'm having a fuckin' smoke.
Is that all right?

You just get here?

Yeah.

I didn't know you were coming.

Last-minute decision.

Come on.

Mendelssohn's Wedding March



Beeping

Have Nots' Dead Man



 Dead man walking
like a wind-up toy

 plodding, never plotting for
the things that bring him joy

 living in the movies
like he's celluloid

 and then it's over

 so roll the credits now

 dead man standing
single file in every line

 gave up on the searching

 he was scared
of what he'd find

 but I don't wanna live
like I'm headed to the grave

 no, I don't wanna
live that way

 got a purpose and a plan

 and I don't wanna live
like a dead man



Both: Panting, moaning

Ah!

What, what?
You okay?

What am I doing?
What am I doing?

Do you want to stop?
We can stop.

- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

We got carried away, all right?
These things happen.

I don't know what I'm doing.

You're using me for revenge.

Am I?

I'm not saying that I mind.
I-I-I do not mind.

I just recognize the impulse.

He was planning on
going to Michigan without me.

Oh, shit.

He acted like he was
gonna take all of us,

but it's not even
the first time that he's lied.

I closed my stupid eyes to it

'cause I wanted it
to work so bad.

Your eyes aren't stupid.

Sighs Oh, I'm an idiot.

Just because
someone dumps on you

does not mean you deserve it.

Tell me that
when someone's dumping on you.

Eve?

That's my wife.

Ex-wife. God.

Papers went through last week.

I'm kinda too chicken
to get it removed,

so I'm thinking about
making it into a bigger word.

"Sleeve" maybe.

"Eleven."
I don't know.

Both: Laugh

I guess you're lucky
her name wasn't "Ocksucker."

Both: Laugh

Yeah.

Yeah.

When did you know
when it was over?

When she started
going to the gym every day.

Sighs You?

Without a hitch.

Son, you did good.

Whispers Close the door.
Close the door.

How much you think
it's all worth?

I don't know.
Maybe 3 grand?

- Really?
- Damn straight.

Hey, let's celebrate.

Go cook us up some spaghettios.

Lis-- listen, I know
that I got sloppy, Nando,

but I will fix it.
Just tell me what I can do.

Run-- run drugs,
steal cars,

you know, my dad has connections
in the government.

He's a powerful man.

He supported
immigration legislation--

So much traffic today.
Are the cubs playing?

It's-- you know what?

It's a good thing
this happened, actually.

I mean, not entirely,
of course,

but I-I'm completely clear
on the rules.

You know, I'm absolutely
on the same page as you.

I mean, thank you for that.
Truly. Truly.

Oh, let's go see who that is.

Oh, hey!

I'm just finishing up
Karen's favorite snack.

Snickerdoodle cupcakes.

She's upstairs.

Um, but hey, um, you don't need

to install the motion lights

because Jody is taking
Karen and Hymie to Sedona

to live near
the vortexes, so...

It's fine.
They're gonna be near family.

And she is his wife, after all.

Is-- is Mrs. Wong
okay with Hymie leaving?

Well, she's his mother,

and babies belong
with their mothers, so...

You go on up.
I'll be right there with snacks.

Chuckles

Hey.

How you feeling?

Exhales

Your mom says you're moving.

I am?

Yeah, to Arizona?

Oh.

The Grand Canyon.

Cactuses.

Right.

Hey...

I know you're in there.
It's just us now, okay?

We can talk.

Hey, uh...

you remember that day

we, uh-- we got drunk

and, uh,
ran around Lincoln Park

setting off all the alarms
on the Priuses?

Yeah.

And then we, um--

we climbed the Lincoln statue

and gave Old Abe some, uh,
lipstick with red sharpie.

Yeah... yeah.

Yeah, you were, uh,
fucking fearless.

And a total shithead.

I remember, um, you made me
go down on you that night

in the bathroom of Bennigan's.

You remember all that?

Yes.

But...

I can't feel.

Feel what?

Stuff.

Inside.

I, uh...

I don't know what that means.

I can't explain.

But...

it's okay.

Are there snacks?

Mandy.
Mandy did this. Okay?

Mandy hit you with the car
and fucked you up forever!

All right?
Because of me.

Mandy Milkovich.

Yes.

Do you understand me?

- Yes.
- Okay.

Do you know who hit you?

No.

Are there snacks?

 Lady in red

People chattering

 is dancing with me

 cheek to cheek

 there's nobody here

Mandy!

Come here.

Laughs
Couldn't stay away, could you?

You ruined Karen's life!

You're a jealous,
demented cunt, Mandy!

Seriously!

All right? We're done!

I did it for you, you prick.

I did everything for you,
but you're so fucking blind.

You know what, don't sweat it.

We were done
before you got here.

This is Kenyatta.

He's my date.

I just swallowed his load
in the bathroom.

Can you taste it?

He did it.

He got married.
To a woman.

I told you
not to come here, okay?

You try sitting on your ass
while the person you love--

No, I'm sorry, I mean
the guy you've been fucking

gets married
to some random commie skank!

Fuckin' commie!

 You were amazing

 never seen
so many people--

Let's go.

Get out of the car.

Sniffles

Okay.

Be a man.
Just this once.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Deep breath.

- Breathes deeply
- Chin up.

Get onto the boat.

Can I just make
one phone call to Fiona?

Please?

Cell phone splashes Fuck.

Engine growling

I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

We're so close.

I gotta lay down
for a little bit.

Ian, hey, stop.
No! We're here!

I'm gonna puke.

Police radios

We know you've been stealing...

Fuck.

- Kid, settle down.
- Hey, whoa, can I help you?

Who are you?

I'm his brother.
What's going on?

We have reason
to believe this child

may have robbed
his former foster parents

while they were
at work this afternoon.

Yeah?
What proof you got?

He had a special security code
assigned to him.

He's the only one
that knows it.

All right, as far as I can
tell, that's not evidence.

Get your fuckin'
hands off him, man.

His code was a series
of four letters.

C-A-R-L.

Take your fuckin' hands
off him, man!

He's just a fucking kid!

All right,
that's enough of that.

Step back, sir.

Take your hands
off the officer right now!

Step away from the officer.

It's gonna be okay.

This kid stole
from people, all right?

- We're taking him in.
- You're ta-- he's a fucking kid!

Do not touch the officer.

- Step back right now!
- Carl, come here!

If you interfere again,
I will arrest you!

Do not touch him!

Why are you being
so rough with him?

You are gonna have to--

Why is he being
so fucking rough with him?

You touch him again,
I will arrest you!

Whoa, whoa.
Good evening, gentlemen.

- Are you the parent?
- Why, yes, I am.

What the fuck
are you doing here, Frank?

I'm coming home.

We're taking your son
in for questioning.

He didn't do the heist, I did.

You see?
Shiny, but a little bit big.

I also got a boatload
of electronics-- those sold fast.

Did you know that Chicago
has several 24-hour pawn shops?

He-- he didn't--
he's innocent.

I forced him
to give me the code.

Didn't I?
Son, tell 'em.

Oh, my God.
He's dumber than a bag of hair.

He couldn't pull off a band-aid,
much less a robbery.

Okay, here.

Cuff me,
before I get disorderly.

This is what you missed last
week on Shameless. Spits

Is your mom not pregnant again?

Every time she pees on
a stick, it's bad news.

And then I get depressed
thinking about my husband

banging my mom 'cause we
selfishly want to have a baby

with some of our DNA.

Attention, people! Kevin
is gonna be a daddy!

Why, is Mandy going a little
cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran
over Karen with her car.

- I can't feel.
- Mandy did this?

Because of me, you ruined Karen's life!

When I was your age, my pop
took me on my first heist.

My foster gays have a lot of nice stuff.

Whoa, can I help you?

We have reason to believe
this child may have robbed

his former foster parents.

He didn't do the heist. I did. Cuff me.

That whore that Mickey is marrying

is an actual whore that
works at Garden Springs spa.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean we can't still bang.

I need a change.

I hear reports of, um, medical school.

Yeah, I may have to spend
some more time in Michigan.

What?

Have you signed up for classes already?

Technically I'm enrolled.

And when was the last
time you saw my daughter?

- Uh, two days ago.
- I saw her three hours ago.

In I.N.S. holding.

It will be dealt with.

You have known from day one

what you were getting into with me.

Right, I got sucked into your world.

I bent to your rules.

You made me feel like
I could depend on you.

You okay? 'Cause you

Not hungry. Thirsty.

You don't look good.

I haven't had a drop of booze
since I got to this place.

I can't even put my hands on a goddamn oxy.

stocked than Walgreen's.

- What the hell happened?
- Guards cracked down.

Well, it's inhumane,

like keeping Insulin from a diabetic.

And for what?

A petty robbery.

And you... what did they get you for again?

Beat my ex-wife to death with a telephone.

- Cordless or landline?
- Sidekick.

Ew, there's food in your braces.

- You're supposed to floss.
- Flossing's for fags.

Spraying Quit it out!

Jackass, what are you doing
with a water gun in the house?

'Cause I don't have a paintball gun.

Actually, that kind of makes sense.

Gonna need a paintball gun
when we move to Michigan.

Uh, no.

Hell survivors paintball
field is only 5 miles

outside Ann Arbor.

- We're not going to Michigan.
- We're not?

- Fiona said we were.
- Yup.

That's when Jimmy was here.
You seen him around lately?

Exactly.

- Did Fiona and Jimmy break up?
- I don't know.

Fiona barks at me every time I bring it up.

But I picked a fight with Becky Alexander

because I thought I was never
gonna have to see her again.

- See who again?
- That a new look for work?

Maybe if I was working
the street corner, yeah.

But since I'm doing data
entry, I better put this on.

Sighs Big day today, Lip.

- Yeah, whatever.
- No, it's not a "whatever."

First Gallagher kid getting his diploma.

- It's a big deal.
- Who'd you buy it from?

He's getting it fair and square and setting

a good example for both
of you, so pay attention.

We have to go to some stupid ceremony?

Nope, I'm picking up my diploma

at the guidance office and
getting the hell out of there.

There's no ceremony in the fall.

He'll walk with everyone in the spring.

- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

And we'll all be there to
yell, "Lip!" and embarrass him.

- Morning.
- Wow, Ian, looking sharp.

- Thanks.
- What, you got ROTC

on the last day before Christmas break?

Yeah, they're having some
sort of winter ceremony.

Later.

Finish your breakfast, you guys.

No more talk of Michigan.

Yo! G.I. Jane, slow down.

- I don't want to be late.
- Hey.

Glad to see you out of bed.

Thought we were gonna have
to put you on a suicide watch,

take away your shoelaces and bed sheets.

No need. Moved on.

How many times you gotta hear no, right?

Yeah. Well, uh, I guess the good thing

about falling for Mickey Milkovich

is you know you can
always find someone better.

Aw. Catch up with you after school.

Right.

Hey, Fiona.

Why aren't you getting ready for school?

I am ready.

We only have a half day anyway.

Gonna stop by Sheila's after.
Karen and Jody are moving today.

Groans Oh.

So you think Jimmy's
still gonna buy me braces

when he's done with med school?

Jimmy can't always be

the answer to our problems, Debbie.

- Everything okay with you guys?
- What?

Lip said we're not moving to Michigan.

Lip should mind his own business.

- It is his business.
- What?

To move to Michigan or not.

It is his business.
It's all of our business.

- School. Now.
- But you didn't answer me.

Are we or are we not moving to Michigan?

I don't know! Okay? I don't know!

And I promise that you're
gonna be the first person

that I tell when I do know, okay?

Leave the adult problems to the adults.

Oh, so it's fine for me to be an adult

when it comes to saving this
family from losing this house

by falsely accusing a
relative of molesting me.

But when I want to know

where we're gonna be
living for the next year,

then I'm just supposed to be a kid

and keep my mouth shut, right?

- Yeah.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

Okay, fine. I get it.

You obviously don't
feel the same way. Fine.

But at least have the decency to tell me.

Okay? Two years? I think I deserve that.

Have a good life. Fucking asshole!

- You're not Morgan Fairchild.
- Excuse me?

Heaven.

I always imagined absinthe
and Morgan Fairchild.

I'm Dr. Markman, and you're not dead.

But you will be soon if
you don't stop drinking.

You got anything for the pain?

Vicodin, Percocet, whatever's handy.

You have liver damage, esophageal varices,

immune system dysfunction,
likely renal failure.

Frankly, it would be faster to
tell you what you don't have.

Maybe the online medical school

you graduated from didn't cover this

before they emailed you your diploma.

I'm going to try to make this simple.

The technical term is "withdrawal."

I like the word "parched."

So if there's not a keg handy,

a bottle of your finest pharmaceuticals

should have me ship-shape in no time.

- You need to stop drinking.
- Spare me the sermon.

Juan will take you to processing.

Are you interested in

- Active duty. Full-time.
- All right.

I'd be happy to help you find a specialty,

let you know when they're classing up.

I don't want to wait for a specialty.

I'm ready to leave now.

Any reason why you're seeking out the army?

Trouble at home?

Running away from jail

I already passed the

- Photo I.D.

I'll be here.

Hey, take some time to think on it.

I'm ready now.

having a party for him?

Nope. It's a surprise.

Men don't give a shit about this stuff.

Well, it's a big deal.

from what's his name?

Do you want to give me
a hand with the banner?

Oh, I guess that's my
cue to get more coffee.

He didn't even have the
balls to dump me in person.

He told you who he was from the beginning.

Car thief. Lied about his name for months.

- Your point?
- Sorry.

No. I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be a bitch about it.

He's a wuss, forget about him.

He's forgotten.

Just pissed I wasted two years of my life.

- You guys aren't being fair.
- What?

Did you or did you not tell
Jimmy the last time you saw him

- not to come home?
- So?

Well, now you're mad at him
for doing exactly what you said?

She didn't mean it.

- Yeah, I did.
- Aah!

Yeah, but just for that night, not forever.

I didn't think he'd take it for real.

Why not?

Because that's what women
do in the heat of the moment.

- We say shit we don't mean.
- I got it.

But how the fuck is he
supposed to know that?

Just go get the car, Kev.

We're gonna be late for the baby doctor.

Okay, fine, but how do I know
you really mean go get the car?

You could be saying, "go get the car,"

in the heat of the moment.

Crazy time of year, end of semester.

of dried nuts and blueberries,
which are good brain food.

Great, mom, but I'm pretty sure

they have all that stuff in Sedona.

Yes, but it's 1,642 miles

Bye, Hymie. It's been nice knowing you.

Remember I told you about him?

He's the medicine man that lives in Sedona.

He cured this woman's ovarian cancer

Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.

I'm surprised to see
you. Are you feeling okay?

Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

Oh.

How's Ian?

Fine.

I was wondering if you'd seen Jimmy lately?

How long?

Almost a week.

You two are having problems?

Things have been a
little rough lately, yeah.

Any sign of conflict or
things not going his way,

and he just... disappears.

Gone.

- Chipotle?
- What?

I always have my hot dog
with a little chipotle sauce.

- You want some?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

Rosa, two specials. Chipotle.

It's what he does. I've gotten used to it.

At least as used to it as
a father can when his son

doesn't call or email for months at a time.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Maybe this time's different?

Absolutely.

Yeah, you never know, right?

I should get back to work.

You'll be fine.

Thanks for the hot dog.

All right, there we go.
There's the little peach pit.

Holy crap, there he is!

He looks just like you, baby.

He kind of does, doesn't he?

Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl, doc?

12 weeks is too early to
tell. Give it another month.

12 weeks? That's impossible.

But we only started trying 12 weeks ago.

Then it must have happened
on the first go-around.

Let me print this up, and
I'll let you get dressed.

Ooh, yeah, that's weird.

Chuckles My body usually
tells me when I'm pregnant.

You know, it's never been wrong before.

Wonder what happened this time.

- What are you doing?
- ROTC retreat.

- Since when?
- Last minute.

- Hey, where's my knife?
- I don't know.

Carl, my S.O.G. Seal team.
It's the best fixed blade I got.

Sighs

My samurai sword broke. Need
a backup till it's fixed.

Yeah.

What if the zombie apocalypse
goes down while you're gone?

Who's gonna protect Debbie and Liam?

- Fine, keep it.
- Really?

Yeah, just promise you're not
gonna use it on anything human.

- Cats aren't human.
- Anything living. Promise.

Promise. Can you teach me
the different hand grips?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

- Hold on, now.
- 12 weeks pregnant!

Veronica, I promise. I swear I had no idea.

Ladies, please.

Hey, V, come on, that's not right.

Although, hey, I should
probably record this

in case we want to upload it to our site,

make some money, just watch her
belly if you're gonna hit her.

12 weeks, Kev?

Just trying to keep the peace, baby.

Honey, I promise, I didn't know!

Please, you always know.

You're like a walking pee stick!

Yeah, in the past, but this time...

There is no "this time."

You kept quiet 'cause you wanted
to keep fucking my husband!

What the fuck are you looking at, huh?

My husband fucked my
mother to get pregnant.

Sorry we can't all have
our baby the normal way!

Hey, what can I say?

Once you go white, you always stay tight.

Hey, I think I just insulted myself.

- Mom, admit it.
- Okay.

Okay, I thought I might be pregnant!

- Oh, my God.
- No, but, honey.

Look, I didn't know.

I didn't take a test or anything.

- I didn't want to know.
- What? Why?

Because I liked what we had.

- Thank you.
- Excuse me?

No, not what we, me and
Kev had, what we all had.

- What are you talking about?
- Been feeling so lonely lately.

And when you called me to help out,

it made me feel wanted...

wanted in a loving way, in a family way,

needed, important.

High-pitched Hey, I'm your baby fetus.

Please don't fight anymore.

I know Kev is a big, hot stud,

and you couldn't resist
his giant cock penis.

But I'm all that matters now, right?

Groans What does it take
to get a refill around here?

Jacket and tie would probably help.

This is nice. We don't
spend enough time together.

No, we don't spend any time together.

Exactly my point.

You know, son, you can always come to me.

Thanks, dad.

- I worry about you.
- Is that right?

A parent's plight never goes away,

no matter how old your kid gets.

Look at you, 18 now.

A high school graduate.

Where the fuck is that waiter?

Don't go getting misty-eyed on me now.

Grunts

Need any words of fatherly advice?

- No, I think I got it covered.
- Oh, come on, come on!

What's on your mind?

Okay, why not? Day
couldn't get any weirder.

Um, I'm done with school.

I have no idea what I'm gonna do

today or tomorrow

or for the rest of my life.

So no plans?

No.

Good for you. You're just like me.

We march to the beat
of a different drummer.

Everyone will try to cage you in,

tell you you have to
worry about your future.

You know what your future should be?

This... living life to the fullest,

every day like it's your last.

This place is single-handedly
lowering my tolerance.

Let's hit the liquor store.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, um, you really think

they deserve your hard-earned
money for that service?

- Dine and dash?
- Bite and bolt.

- Eat it and beat it?
- I'll take the front door.

Excuse me, amigo, uh, bano?

Gracias.

Excuse me, I gotta take this call.

- Can we see a dessert menu?
- Of course.

Hey, Fiona, missed you at lunch.

What are all these people
doing outside Mike's office?

- Job applicants.
- Thanks so much, man, okay?

We'll talk to you later this week.

You bet.

Hi. Uh, sorry. Can I
talk to you for a second?

Yeah, uh, sure. Clears throat

- There's a job opening up?
- Yeah.

Rick from sales is moving
to our Columbus office.

Well, I want it.

No, I need somebody with experience.

Chuckles

This is about our night in the tent.

- I can assure you it is not.
- But I've been here for months.

My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.

I would love to keep you around,

but Uncle Matt's not
gonna let me hire someone

who doesn't have a proven track record.

Which all those people out there do, okay?

Listen, if you had one sale on the books,

this would be a different conversation.

I've pushed cocktails, that's sales.

Wait, weren't you moving to Michigan?

I mean, you wanted to work
in our Ann Arbor office.

And I convinced all those customers

you thought you lost to re-up.

You got them on the hook, but
it was the sales department

that closed the deals. Sighs

Hey.

You've been a great asset to this company.

I'm really sorry.

I remember the first
time I brought you here.

Fuck you! You never took me skating.

Always took you skating,
to the park, to the zoo.

You tried to make off with a tortoise.

That was you.

Huh. Good market in endangered species.

That's 'cause it's illegal, Frank.

- Bleeding heart eco-fascist.
- Chuckles

It's called survival of
the fittest for a reason.

You don't want to be
endangered, speed the fuck up!

- Laughs
- Grow some opposable thumbs!

Otherwise you end up on eBay for 10 grand,

as Darwin intended.

Coughs

Uh-oh!

Grunts All right.

- More for a rhino.
- What?

Horn. Pay a king's ransom in Asia.

Grind it into powder.
Morons say it cures cancer.

Also tiger dick.

They take a couple of bites,
and they think it turns them

into fuck machines. Laughter

I'm not making this shit up!

Oh, shit! This is slippery. Whoo!

- I'm gonna... shit!
- All right.

Okay, here we go. Here we go.

Laughter

- We should do this more often.
- Afternoon drinking buddies?

We could hit the zoo tomorrow. Steal it.

- What?
- The rhino horn.

Do it together.

- You're fucking wasted.
- Alcohol provides clarity.

We hide in the bird
sanctuary until closing.

We drug the rhino.

Once it's down, a quick
back and forth with the saw.

And we're a few clicks
away from a bidding war.

What do you say?

- Coughing
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

You're not some co-ed on spring break.

Gallaghers do not puke! Oh, stop!

- Vomiting
- Oh!

- Vomiting continues
- Oh, God.

Domino effect!

- Laughs
- Whoa!

Hey!

You two are out of here right now!

- He okay?
- Frank? Frank!

Barry, I need an ambulance.

Can I help you?

Dude, don't you know it's not cool

to rush a woman alone on the street?

He wanted you to have this.

Who? What the hell is that?

The man who lived here with you.

Jimmy?

Wait! Hey, wait!

Was he here? Where is he?

Hey, did he say anything else?

Yes, he said you were too good for him.

He has moved on. Now so must you.

Engine starts

Hey!

Come on! Hey!

Cell phone rings

Lip, what's going on?

Hi, I'm Fiona Gallagher.

My father Frank Gallagher
was just admitted.

- Let me check.
- What's wrong with him?

Sighs You mean this time?
I wouldn't worry, it's Frank.

- I bet he has cancer.
- Only if there's money in it.

First left, fourth door on the right.

Thanks.

Stay here, okay?

- What?
- No.

Yes, I'll tell you as
soon as I know anything.

No, I'm sick of you treating
me like a little baby.

- Me too.
- Okay. Go wait in the lobby.

Now!

Sighs

Hey, uh, were you just
in there with my father?

- Francis Gallagher?
- I was.

Well, can you tell me what's going on?

Just broke the news to
him. Took it in stride.

Although I don't think
he's truly accepting it yet.

What... what news? Took what in stride?

Rock music

Under $100.

Knock on door

- Hi, there.
- Hey! I'm glad you're here.

Try to get me some more of
these pudding cups, would you?

- No! Don't mention food!
- Oh, Jesus, Lip! Really?

It smells like a distillery in there.

Celebrating my graduation.

Getting drunk in the
middle of the day with him?

Are you an idiot? Laughs

Please save the mommy
lecture for tomorrow, please,

when my head isn't pounding so much.

Get up, get home. Get sober.

We're planning a surprise party for you.

It's not a surprise, I already knew.

Well, Debbie and Carl
are waiting in the lobby.

So take them with you. Groans

This isn't gonna be fun.

Yeah, and grab your surprise ice cream cake

out of the freezer and start defrosting it.

- Okay.
- Chuckles

Three raw eggs, worcestershire,
and a sliver of ginger.

Works every time. Coughs

Jesus. No HBO, no
Showtime. Just basic cable.

And what the hell is a Tosh 2.0?

- The doctor talk to you, Frank?
- Yeah.

"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, stop drinking.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

He told me you were really sick.

Do I look really sick to you?

Said you were throwing up blood.

That's 'cause I've got
too much of it in me.

It's a filtration process.

My body knows how to flush itself out.

Stop joking. This is serious.

It's just doctor mumbo jumbo

to scare you into taking more tests.

- Fucking parasites.
- What are you doing?

- I gotta use the can.
- Well, let's get the nurse.

I don't like the one
that's on duty. She's fat.

Roll that thing behind me, will you?

Grunts

Sighs

He said if you don't stop
drinking, you're gonna die.

As in dead, you know,

like, no longer living? And soon.

Urinating When did you start to care?

Not sure that I do.

I've dreamt about your death.

Put money in a collection
box and prayed for it.

Blew out my birthday
candles, wished for it.

If it actually ever happened,

I don't know if I'd feel relief or guilt.

Chuckles Your birthday candles?

Laughs

I wrote a letter to Santa once.

Laughs

So I'm supposed to stop drinking

so that you don't feel guilty?

No.

You're supposed to stop
drinking because you have

children at home who love you.

And I don't know why.

Who would be destroyed if
anything happened to you.

Tragedy makes kids tough, Fiona.

Then be the fabulous
narcissist that you are,

and do it for yourself.

What if I don't want to change?

Then I would know what
I've always feared is true.

What is that?

That you don't give a shit about any of us.

So do it for you.

Do it for your kids.

It doesn't matter.

Do it.

Hey, where were you today?
I didn't see you at school.

Something came up.

They gave us homework
over the Christmas break.

I told Mrs. Stoltz that Jesus
didn't want us celebrating

his birthday by fucking reading.

You want the assignments?

- Just came by to see you.
- Who's at the goddamn door?

It's for me, shithead!

Got some nitrous. I'll go get it.

Hey.

Up to four sets of 20.

Get in here. I want to show you something.

Come on. Come check it out.

Wife made me take all my Nazi shit down.

She hates Nazis.

Apparently the Russians
kicked some serious kraut ass

in world war II, so...

She can drink me under
the fucking table, man.

It's weird.

Anyways...

she's working tomorrow night.

Why don't we pick up where we left off?

Figure she's gonna be out fucking dudes.

Why can't I?

No, thanks.

Mm. Hard to get's getting
me hard, Gallagher.

I'm, uh, leaving town.

There a queer rights rally somewhere?

Army.

Ah! Right. You gotta be 18.

Yeah, I figured a way around that.

You serious? You're signing up?

Tomorrow morning.

That's a dumb-ass fucking move. How long?

Four years. Minimum.

What are you hoping, I tell you not to go?

I'm gonna chase after you like some bitch?

Didn't come here for you.

Don't.

- Don't what?
- Just...

I got the nitrous. Meet you outside.

Yeah.

What the fuck do you want?

Really? That's all you're gonna say to him?

You're a fucking pussy.

- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, I fed Liam.

And put him down a half an hour ago.

- Thanks.
- How's daddy?

- Is he okay?
- Sighs That's up to him.

What does that mean?

We should be at the
hospital helping him out.

- He needs to help himself.
- What?

What's up with taking down the decorations?

Lip told us to.

No one feels much like a party.

Hey, sometimes life throws
a couple swings at you.

But we're Gallaghers, okay?

And there's two things
that we're really good at...

knowing how to get back up
and knowing how to party.

So you get the tape, start
hanging up that banner.

And you go get Kev and V.

Sheila, start taking the food back out.

I'll get Lip. Whoo!

Knock on door

Hungry?

- Don't.
- Chicken pot pie.

- God, seriously.
- Sloppy Joes.

- Stop, Fiona.
- Serves you right.

Hell of a way to start
life after graduation.

- Where is it?
- What?

The piece of paper.

Mm. Clears throat

I wasn't actually sure you'd ever get this.

That makes two of us.

I'm proud of you.

I came into some money.

Bury the lead, why don't you?

I put a bunch away for rent and gas,

but there's something I
want to do with the rest.

Please don't tell me you're gonna promote

another club night,
okay? I'm nauseous enough.

Mm, something else.

Could get a full-time job out of it.

If I say okay, will you
close the fucking door?

- You're wanted downstairs.
- I got the spins, Fi.

Get it together and put
a smile on your face.

Debbie and Carl need motivation.

Come on, everyone's waiting.

Sighs Okay.

- Walk forward.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay.

And...

All: Surprise!

are delicious, Sheila.

Oh.

I was thinking about some fun things

we could do tomorrow together.

Oh, um, actually,
Veronica was gonna take me

- to the skating rink.
- Oh.

I really enjoy hanging
out with you, Sheila,

but now that there's an empty nest,

maybe it's a good time for you

to start making some new friends

closer to your own age
who share your interests.

Maybe.

Whoa! Screaming

an early baby shower gift.

I need you to order a couple thousand cups

Cups? It's a bar, not a frat party.

We drink out of glasses and mugs.

Where did you get this from?

Tell them I convinced you to do it.

Okay.

What's going on?

Chuckles Nice. Best cure for a hangover.

Sweet.

Thanks.

I wanted you to be the first to know.

Jimmy's gone for good?

Mm-hmm.

But there's a chance I might get a new job.

- At the cup company.
- Maybe.

That's great.

Don't tell anybody about
it unless it happens, okay?

Comes with benefits.

Dental?

For me too?

Well, don't blow it. Get the job.

I'll try.

week on Shameless. Spits

Is your mom not pregnant again?

Every time she pees on
a stick, it's bad news.

And then I get depressed
thinking about my husband

banging my mom 'cause we
selfishly want to have a baby

with some of our DNA.

Attention, people! Kevin
is gonna be a daddy!

Why, is Mandy going a little
cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

No need. Moved on.

How many times you gotta hear no, right?

Yeah. Well, uh, I guess the good thing

about falling for Mickey Milkovich

is you know you can
always find someone better.

Aw. Catch up with you after school.

Right.

Hey, Fiona.

Why aren't you getting ready for school?

I am ready.

We only have a half day anyway.

Gonna stop by Sheila's after.
Karen and Jody are moving today.

Groans Oh.

So you think Jimmy's
still gonna buy me braces

when he's done with med school?

Jimmy can't always be

the answer to our problems, Debbie.

- Everything okay with you guys?
- What?

Lip said we're not moving to Michigan.

Lip should mind his own business.

- It is his business.
- What?

To move to Michigan or not.

It is his business.
It's all of our business.

- School. Now.
- But you didn't answer me.

Are we or are we not moving to Michigan?

I don't know! Okay? I don't know!

And I promise that you're
gonna be the first person

that I tell when I do know, okay?

Leave the adult problems to the adults.

Oh, so it's fine for me to be an adult

when it comes to saving this
family from losing this house

by falsely accusing a
relative of molesting me.

But when I want to know

where we're gonna be
living for the next year,

then I'm just supposed to be a kid

and keep my mouth shut, right?

- Yeah.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

Phone ringing

It's Steve. Leave some words.

Beep Seriously?

I leave you a message saying
that I want to work it out,

and you don't even call me back?

Okay, fine. I get it.

You obviously don't
feel the same way. Fine.

But at least have the decency to tell me.

Okay? Two years? I think I deserve that.

Have a good life. Fucking asshole!

- You're not Morgan Fairchild.
- Excuse me?

Heaven.

I always imagined absinthe
and Morgan Fairchild.

I'm Dr. Markman, and you're not dead.

But you will be soon if
you don't stop drinking.

You got anything for the pain?

Vicodin, Percocet, whatever's handy.

You have liver damage, esophageal varices,

immune system dysfunction,
likely renal failure.

Frankly, it would be faster to
tell you what you don't have.

Maybe the online medical school

you graduated from didn't cover this

before they emailed you your diploma.

I'm going to try to make this simple.

The technical term is "withdrawal."

I like the word "parched."

So if there's not a keg handy,

a bottle of your finest pharmaceuticals

should have me ship-shape in no time.

- You need to stop drinking.
- Spare me the sermon.

Juan will take you to processing.

- Processing?
- You're being released.

What?

If we keep you here,
we'd have to treat you.

Stop drinking before it kills you.

Coughing Grunts

Aah! Fuck.

Hit me, Kate.

Thought I was the only one here into that.

No time for flirting, got
some catching up to do.

Line 'em up.

Bluegrass music



- Morning.
- I want to enlist.

Glad to hear it.

Are you interested in
active duty or army reserve?

- Active duty. Full-time.
- All right.

I'd be happy to help you find a specialty,

let you know when they're classing up.

I don't want to wait for a specialty.

I'm ready to leave now.

Any reason why you're seeking out the army?

Trouble at home?

Running away from jail
or a pregnant girlfriend?

Here's my transcript.

I already passed the
vocational aptitude battery

and physical exams.

When's the next bus to
basic combat training?

Tomorrow morning.

- What else do I need?
- Photo I.D.

I'll be here.

Hey, take some time to think on it.

I'm ready now.

So does he know we're
having a party for him?

Nope. It's a surprise.

Men don't give a shit about this stuff.

Well, it's a big deal.

First Gallagher kid getting a diploma.

Hey, what about you?

- G.E.D. doesn't really count.
- Diplomas are overrated.

I didn't get a diploma, and look at me.

Mimicking veronica Hey,
don't give me no shit, Kev!

- I do not sound like that.
- Popping

Oh! Give me those! You
better watch yourself.

Laughs Ow!

How would you like it if I did that to you?

Growls Screams Don't bite! No!

Laughs

So still haven't heard
from what's his name?

Do you want to give me
a hand with the banner?

Oh, I guess that's my
cue to get more coffee.

He didn't even have the
balls to dump me in person.

He told you who he was from the beginning.

Car thief. Lied about his name for months.

- Your point?
- Sorry.

No. I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be a bitch about it.

He's a wuss, forget about him.

He's forgotten.

Just pissed I wasted two years of my life.

- You guys aren't being fair.
- What?

Did you or did you not tell
Jimmy the last time you saw him

- not to come home?
- So?

Well, now you're mad at him
for doing exactly what you said?

She didn't mean it.

- Yeah, I did.
- Aah!

Yeah, but just for that night, not forever.

I didn't think he'd take it for real.

Why not?

Because that's what women
do in the heat of the moment.

- We say shit we don't mean.
- I got it.

But how the fuck is he
supposed to know that?

Just go get the car, Kev.

We're gonna be late for the baby doctor.

Okay, fine, but how do I know
you really mean go get the car?

You could be saying, "go get the car,"

in the heat of the moment.

Crazy time of year, end of semester.

I have to let a litany
of underachievers know

they'd best be advised to cut their losses

and learn a trade, something
that utilizes their backs

instead of their brains. Chuckles

It's moments like this
that make the job worth it.

Crap pay, miserable working conditions,

but the chance to change
one special kid's life.

Congratulations.

Wow.

Guess this is where I'm
supposed to, uh, thank you

for never giving up on me.

- Chuckles
- Well.

I'll see ya, Dick. Sighs

Teachers are taking bets
what's next for you, Gallagher.

College, ten to one. Prison, four to one.

Hey, Kate, can I get a shot?

And enable your truancy?

This place is pathetic enough already.

I'm not skipping school.

Surprisingly, they let me graduate.

Good for you. This one's on the house.

Thanks.

I know what you're
thinking. You can tap that.

And you'd be right. But chew on this.

Sure, she's got some
frisky tricks up her sleeve,

but there's more tread on
those tires than it's worth.

Trust me, been there.

Planted my flag and I got
the piss pins and needles

to prove it.

I thought you were in jail, Frank.

Got out on a technicality.

Why did you take the rap for Carl?

Because that's what family does.

- Have I taught you nothing?
- Congratulations.

- Thank you.
- Congra... what for?

Your kid got his diploma.

My boy!

Why didn't you say something?
We need to celebrate.

Attention! Grunts

Denizens of this dump!

- Frank, you okay?
- Better than ever!

Because my progeny has joined
the ranks of the graduated!

Cheers and applause

Which makes official
something we've long known,

which is that the Gallaghers
are head and shoulders above

all of you shitbirds! Crowd grumbling

Seriously, Frank, you look like crap.

Even for you. You're one to talk, Tommy.

You're one bucket of kfc extra crispy away

from giving precious a run for her money.

Laughter Oh!

You know I got a fucking
thyroid condition...

Chuckles Oh.

And I could still kick your ass.

Well, why don't you put your money

where your halitosis-ridden mouth is.

Hey, I'm not mopping up the
blood and the teeth again.

Figure out another way to
settle your pissing contest.

- Fine, pissing contest!
- Fine!

Let's go!

Hey, I didn't mean it literally!

Pushups!

Scoffs You won't make double digits.

What does it matter?

You can't count that high anyway.

- Oh, I want in on this!
- Me too!

Let's do it! Push these tables aside.

- Hold on.
- Make a hole.

No girlie, on-your-knees push-ups.

Only one of us spends
time on their knees, Frank,

and it ain't me.

- Laughs
- Okay, 10 bucks in.

My kid will hold. 20!

Thank you. Overlapping chatter

Thank you, thank you.
All right, no food stamps.

But lottery scratchers are accepted.

Okay. All right, we're ready.

Get set!

And go!

One, two,

three, four... All grunting

Five, six, seven...

- Coughing
- Eight, nine!

Tommy!

Coughing

11, 12!

Know what kind of upper body strength

it takes to handle a rig, Gallagher?

I can do this all day.

Not just a test of strength but stamina.

The kind one gets from
years of running from people,

not sitting on your ass in
a truck for 18 hours a day.

Grunts

27, 28, 29, 30,

31, 32! Uh-oh.

All shouting

Laughs

Um, there you go, uh, drink responsibly.

Scoffs

Hey, Kate, can I get another shot?

Hey, wanna go celebrate?

- Uh...
- A steak.

- No.
- Aw, come on!

You got something better to do?

Make it a scotch and a lobster,

you got yourself a deal.

All right!

Sighs

Phone rings

It's Steve. Leave some words.

Beep Chuckles

So you just never pick up anymore, huh?

Hi. It's Fiona.

Fiona Gallagher. Remember me?

We used to date.

Maybe we still do.

I left you a message this morning.

You should probably just delete that.

Chuckles

You know that thing I
said about not coming home?

I didn't mean it.

I mean, I did mean it.
Just for that night though.

Not forever, silly.

Sorry if I wasn't clear about that.

Give me a call.

I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Okay, so I've got little baggies

of dried nuts and blueberries,
which are good brain food.

Great, mom, but I'm pretty sure

they have all that stuff in Sedona.

Yes, but it's 1,642 miles
if you take scenic I-40.

Bye, Hymie. It's been nice knowing you.

Grunts And you have to look up Shiva Ray.

Remember I told you about him?

He's the medicine man that lives in Sedona.

I read about him online.

He cured this woman's ovarian cancer

by giving her wheatgrass douches.

- Great, I'll look her up.
- Him. He's a him.

- Shiva Ray. Him.
- I'll look him up.

Okay.

Grunts All right. This is it.

Oh, my goodness.

I know I agreed to
this, but it doesn't mean

it's not hard to say good-bye

to my baby.

Both my babies.

All three of my babies!

Bye, baby. Cries

Shh. Okay.

- Cries
- It's okay, it's okay.

Sighs

My sweet Karen.

I knew this day would come,

when I'd be saying a
proper good-bye to you.

It didn't really look like this though.

You didn't...

you didn't have a wheelchair and... and...

a big... scar on your head.

I know I have to let you go.

Goodbye.

Just stop it. No more good-byes.

Just see you soon.

- See you soon.
- See you soon!

- See you soon.
- See you soon!

Baby.

We'll call you when we get settled in.

Okay. Go heal my baby.

I will.

- Sniffles
- Bye, baby.

Door closes Bye, baby.

Engine starting

Bye, honey!

Bye! Bye!

Love you!

Want me to make you
some macaroni and cheese?

Uh, I have to finish
getting the house ready

for Lip's party.

Let me grab my coat. I can come help.

Sure.

So don't worry, I'll make sure

that you have everything you need.

Dr. Lishman?

Fiona. Hi.

Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.

I'm surprised to see
you. Are you feeling okay?

Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

Oh.

How's Ian?

Fine.

I was wondering if you'd seen Jimmy lately?

How long?

Almost a week.

You two are having problems?

Things have been a
little rough lately, yeah.

Any sign of conflict or
things not going his way,

and he just... disappears.

Gone.

- Chipotle?
- What?

I always have my hot dog
with a little chipotle sauce.

- You want some?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

Rosa, two specials. Chipotle.

It's what he does. I've gotten used to it.

At least as used to it as
a father can when his son

doesn't call or email for months at a time.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Maybe this time's different?

Absolutely.

Yeah, you never know, right?

I should get back to work.

You'll be fine.

Thanks for the hot dog.

All right, there we go.
There's the little peach pit.

Holy crap, there he is!

He looks just like you, baby.

He kind of does, doesn't he?

Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl, doc?

12 weeks is too early to
tell. Give it another month.

12 weeks? That's impossible.

But we only started trying 12 weeks ago.

Then it must have happened
on the first go-around.

Let me print this up, and
I'll let you get dressed.

Ooh, yeah, that's weird.

Chuckles My body usually
tells me when I'm pregnant.

You know, it's never been wrong before.

Wonder what happened this time.

- What are you doing?
- ROTC retreat.

- Since when?
- Last minute.

- Hey, where's my knife?
- I don't know.

Carl, my S.O.G. Seal team.
It's the best fixed blade I got.

Sighs

My samurai sword broke. Need
a backup till it's fixed.

Yeah.

What if the zombie apocalypse
goes down while you're gone?

Who's gonna protect Debbie and Liam?

- Fine, keep it.
- Really?

Yeah, just promise you're not
gonna use it on anything human.

- Cats aren't human.
- Anything living. Promise.

Promise. Can you teach me
the different hand grips?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

- Hold on, now.
- 12 weeks pregnant!

Veronica, I promise. I swear I had no idea.

Ladies, please.

Hey, V, come on, that's not right.

Although, hey, I should
probably record this

in case we want to upload it to our site,

make some money, just watch her
belly if you're gonna hit her.

12 weeks, Kev?

Just trying to keep the peace, baby.

Honey, I promise, I didn't know!

Please, you always know.

You're like a walking pee stick!

Yeah, in the past, but this time...

There is no "this time."

You kept quiet 'cause you wanted
to keep fucking my husband!

What the fuck are you looking at, huh?

My husband fucked my
mother to get pregnant.

Sorry we can't all have
our baby the normal way!

Hey, what can I say?

Once you go white, you always stay tight.

Hey, I think I just insulted myself.

- Mom, admit it.
- Okay.

Okay, I thought I might be pregnant!

- Oh, my God.
- No, but, honey.

Look, I didn't know.

I didn't take a test or anything.

- I didn't want to know.
- What? Why?

Because I liked what we had.

- Thank you.
- Excuse me?

No, not what we, me and
Kev had, what we all had.

- What are you talking about?
- Been feeling so lonely lately.

And when you called me to help out,

it made me feel wanted...

wanted in a loving way, in a family way,

needed, important.

High-pitched Hey, I'm your baby fetus.

Please don't fight anymore.

I know Kev is a big, hot stud,

and you couldn't resist
his giant cock penis.

But I'm all that matters now, right?

Groans What does it take
to get a refill around here?

Jacket and tie would probably help.

This is nice. We don't
spend enough time together.

No, we don't spend any time together.

Exactly my point.

You know, son, you can always come to me.

Thanks, dad.

- I worry about you.
- Is that right?

A parent's plight never goes away,

no matter how old your kid gets.

Look at you, 18 now.

A high school graduate.

Where the fuck is that waiter?

Don't go getting misty-eyed on me now.

Grunts

Need any words of fatherly advice?

- No, I think I got it covered.
- Oh, come on, come on!

What's on your mind?

Okay, why not? Day
couldn't get any weirder.

Um, I'm done with school.

I have no idea what I'm gonna do

today or tomorrow

or for the rest of my life.

So no plans?

No.

Good for you. You're just like me.

We march to the beat
of a different drummer.

Everyone will try to cage you in,

tell you you have to
worry about your future.

You know what your future should be?

This... living life to the fullest,

every day like it's your last.

This place is single-handedly
lowering my tolerance.

Let's hit the liquor store.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, um, you really think

they deserve your hard-earned
money for that service?

- Dine and dash?
- Bite and bolt.

- Eat it and beat it?
- I'll take the front door.

Excuse me, amigo, uh, bano?

Gracias.

Excuse me, I gotta take this call.

- Can we see a dessert menu?
- Of course.

Hey, Fiona, missed you at lunch.

What are all these people
doing outside Mike's office?

- Job applicants.
- Thanks so much, man, okay?

We'll talk to you later this week.

You bet.

Hi. Uh, sorry. Can I
talk to you for a second?

Yeah, uh, sure. Clears throat

- There's a job opening up?
- Yeah.

Rick from sales is moving
to our Columbus office.

Well, I want it.

No, I need somebody with experience.

Chuckles

This is about our night in the tent.

- I can assure you it is not.
- But I've been here for months.

My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.

I would love to keep you around,

but Uncle Matt's not
gonna let me hire someone

who doesn't have a proven track record.

Which all those people out there do, okay?

Listen, if you had one sale on the books,

this would be a different conversation.

I've pushed cocktails, that's sales.

Wait, weren't you moving to Michigan?

I mean, you wanted to work
in our Ann Arbor office.

And I convinced all those customers

you thought you lost to re-up.

You got them on the hook, but
it was the sales department

that closed the deals. Sighs

Hey.

You've been a great asset to this company.

I'm really sorry.

I remember the first
time I brought you here.

Fuck you! You never took me skating.

Always took you skating,
to the park, to the zoo.

You tried to make off with a tortoise.

That was you.

Huh. Good market in endangered species.

That's 'cause it's illegal, Frank.

- Bleeding heart eco-fascist.
- Chuckles

It's called survival of
the fittest for a reason.

You don't want to be
endangered, speed the fuck up!

- Laughs
- Grow some opposable thumbs!

Otherwise you end up on eBay for 10 grand,

as Darwin intended.

Coughs

Uh-oh!

Grunts All right.

- More for a rhino.
- What?

Horn. Pay a king's ransom in Asia.

Grind it into powder.
Morons say it cures cancer.

Also tiger dick.

They take a couple of bites,
and they think it turns them

into fuck machines. Laughter

I'm not making this shit up!

Oh, shit! This is slippery. Whoo!

- I'm gonna... shit!
- All right.

Okay, here we go. Here we go.

Laughter

- We should do this more often.
- Afternoon drinking buddies?

We could hit the zoo tomorrow. Steal it.

- What?
- The rhino horn.

Do it together.

- You're fucking wasted.
- Alcohol provides clarity.

We hide in the bird
sanctuary until closing.

We drug the rhino.

Once it's down, a quick
back and forth with the saw.

And we're a few clicks
away from a bidding war.

What do you say?

- Coughing
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

You're not some co-ed on spring break.

Gallaghers do not puke! Oh, stop!

- Vomiting
- Oh!

- Vomiting continues
- Oh, God.

Domino effect!

- Laughs
- Whoa!

Hey!

You two are out of here right now!

- He okay?
- Frank? Frank!

Barry, I need an ambulance.

Can I help you?

Dude, don't you know it's not cool

to rush a woman alone on the street?

He wanted you to have this.

Who? What the hell is that?

The man who lived here with you.

Jimmy?

Wait! Hey, wait!

Was he here? Where is he?

Hey, did he say anything else?

Yes, he said you were too good for him.

He has moved on. Now so must you.

Engine starts

Hey!

Come on! Hey!

Cell phone rings

Lip, what's going on?

Hi, I'm Fiona Gallagher.

My father Frank Gallagher
was just admitted.

- Let me check.
- What's wrong with him?

Sighs You mean this time?
I wouldn't worry, it's Frank.

- I bet he has cancer.
- Only if there's money in it.

First left, fourth door on the right.

Thanks.

Stay here, okay?

- What?
- No.

Yes, I'll tell you as
soon as I know anything.

No, I'm sick of you treating
me like a little baby.

- Me too.
- Okay. Go wait in the lobby.

Now!

Sighs

Hey, uh, were you just
in there with my father?

- Francis Gallagher?
- I was.

Well, can you tell me what's going on?

Just broke the news to
him. Took it in stride.

Although I don't think
he's truly accepting it yet.

What... what news? Took what in stride?

Rock music

Under $100.

Knock on door

- Hi, there.
- Hey! I'm glad you're here.

Try to get me some more of
these pudding cups, would you?

- No! Don't mention food!
- Oh, Jesus, Lip! Really?

It smells like a distillery in there.

Celebrating my graduation.

Getting drunk in the
middle of the day with him?

Are you an idiot? Laughs

Please save the mommy
lecture for tomorrow, please,

when my head isn't pounding so much.

Get up, get home. Get sober.

We're planning a surprise party for you.

It's not a surprise, I already knew.

Well, Debbie and Carl
are waiting in the lobby.

So take them with you. Groans

This isn't gonna be fun.

Yeah, and grab your surprise ice cream cake

out of the freezer and start defrosting it.

- Okay.
- Chuckles

Three raw eggs, worcestershire,
and a sliver of ginger.

Works every time. Coughs

Jesus. No HBO, no
Showtime. Just basic cable.

And what the hell is a Tosh 2.0?

- The doctor talk to you, Frank?
- Yeah.

"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, stop drinking.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

He told me you were really sick.

Do I look really sick to you?

Said you were throwing up blood.

That's 'cause I've got
too much of it in me.

It's a filtration process.

My body knows how to flush itself out.

Stop joking. This is serious.

It's just doctor mumbo jumbo

to scare you into taking more tests.

- Fucking parasites.
- What are you doing?

- I gotta use the can.
- Well, let's get the nurse.

I don't like the one
that's on duty. She's fat.

Roll that thing behind me, will you?

Grunts

Sighs

He said if you don't stop
drinking, you're gonna die.

As in dead, you know,

like, no longer living? And soon.

Urinating When did you start to care?

Not sure that I do.

I've dreamt about your death.

Put money in a collection
box and prayed for it.

Blew out my birthday
candles, wished for it.

If it actually ever happened,

I don't know if I'd feel relief or guilt.

Chuckles Your birthday candles?

Laughs

I wrote a letter to Santa once.

Laughs

So I'm supposed to stop drinking

so that you don't feel guilty?

No.

You're supposed to stop
drinking because you have

children at home who love you.

And I don't know why.

Who would be destroyed if
anything happened to you.

Tragedy makes kids tough, Fiona.

Then be the fabulous
narcissist that you are,

and do it for yourself.

What if I don't want to change?

Then I would know what
I've always feared is true.

What is that?

That you don't give a shit about any of us.

So do it for you.

Do it for your kids.

It doesn't matter.

Do it.

Upbeat rock music



 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, where were you today?
I didn't see you at school.

Something came up.

They gave us homework
over the Christmas break.

I told Mrs. Stoltz that Jesus
didn't want us celebrating

his birthday by fucking reading.

You want the assignments?

- Just came by to see you.
- Who's at the goddamn door?

It's for me, shithead!

Got some nitrous. I'll go get it.

Hey.

Up to four sets of 20.

Get in here. I want to show you something.

Come on. Come check it out.

Wife made me take all my Nazi shit down.

She hates Nazis.

Apparently the Russians
kicked some serious kraut ass

in world war II, so...

She can drink me under
the fucking table, man.

It's weird.

Anyways...

she's working tomorrow night.

Why don't we pick up where we left off?

Figure she's gonna be out fucking dudes.

Why can't I?

No, thanks.

Mm. Hard to get's getting
me hard, Gallagher.

I'm, uh, leaving town.

There a queer rights rally somewhere?

Army.

Ah! Right. You gotta be 18.

Yeah, I figured a way around that.

You serious? You're signing up?

Tomorrow morning.

That's a dumb-ass fucking move. How long?

Four years. Minimum.

What are you hoping, I tell you not to go?

I'm gonna chase after you like some bitch?

Didn't come here for you.

Don't.

- Don't what?
- Just...

I got the nitrous. Meet you outside.

Yeah.

What the fuck do you want?

Really? That's all you're gonna say to him?

You're a fucking pussy.

- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, I fed Liam.

And put him down a half an hour ago.

- Thanks.
- How's daddy?

- Is he okay?
- Sighs That's up to him.

What does that mean?

We should be at the
hospital helping him out.

- He needs to help himself.
- What?

What's up with taking down the decorations?

Lip told us to.

No one feels much like a party.

Hey, sometimes life throws
a couple swings at you.

But we're Gallaghers, okay?

And there's two things
that we're really good at...

knowing how to get back up
and knowing how to party.

So you get the tape, start
hanging up that banner.

And you go get Kev and V.

Sheila, start taking the food back out.

I'll get Lip. Whoo!

Knock on door

Hungry?

- Don't.
- Chicken pot pie.

- God, seriously.
- Sloppy Joes.

- Stop, Fiona.
- Serves you right.

Hell of a way to start
life after graduation.

- Where is it?
- What?

The piece of paper.

Mm. Clears throat

I wasn't actually sure you'd ever get this.

That makes two of us.

I'm proud of you.

I came into some money.

Bury the lead, why don't you?

I put a bunch away for rent and gas,

but there's something I
want to do with the rest.

Please don't tell me you're gonna promote

another club night,
okay? I'm nauseous enough.

Mm, something else.

Could get a full-time job out of it.

If I say okay, will you
close the fucking door?

- You're wanted downstairs.
- I got the spins, Fi.

Get it together and put
a smile on your face.

Debbie and Carl need motivation.

Come on, everyone's waiting.

Sighs Okay.

- Walk forward.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay.

And...

All: Surprise!

You can educate our baby!

Eh, well, um...

I'm going to go with ambrosia.

The shrimp crab cakes
are delicious, Sheila.

Oh.

I was thinking about some fun things

we could do tomorrow together.

Oh, um, actually,
Veronica was gonna take me

- to the skating rink.
- Oh.

I really enjoy hanging
out with you, Sheila,

but now that there's an empty nest,

maybe it's a good time for you

to start making some new friends

closer to your own age
who share your interests.

Maybe.

Whoa! Screaming

Laughter Congratulations.

Debs, play some music. Get it going!

Hey, Fi, good news, V and I came up

with a compromise on a name.

Amy if it's a girl,
D'Shawndre if it's a boy.

- Giggles
- What?

Please tell me this is
an early baby shower gift.

I need you to order a couple thousand cups

for the Alibi first thing in the morning.

Cups? It's a bar, not a frat party.

We drink out of glasses and mugs.

Where did you get this from?

Tell them I convinced you to do it.

Okay.

What's going on?

Chuckles Nice. Best cure for a hangover.

Sweet.

Thanks.

Where the fuck's he going? Door closes

Worried?

What's gonna happen to daddy?

He always finds a way.

We're not moving to Michigan.

I wanted you to be the first to know.

Jimmy's gone for good?

Mm-hmm.

But there's a chance I might get a new job.

- At the cup company.
- Maybe.

That's great.

Don't tell anybody about
it unless it happens, okay?

Comes with benefits.

Dental?

For me too?

Well, don't blow it. Get the job.

I'll try.

This is the one I was telling you about.

This is Fiona Gallagher,

Good one. A sale in the books.

Yeah. Overnight, no less.

Let's give her a two-week trial, Mike.

- See if it works out.
- Laughs Thank you, sir.

Okay.

- Aah!
- Yay!

Here we go.

Pens, paper, and all the office supplies

you need are in the top drawer.

Your direct phone number
is listed on the call sheet.

You should record an outgoing message.

Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Clears throat Phillip?

It's Lip.

It's just Gallagher now. Get on.

Next.

We can order your business cards.

Whoohoo!

- Ah, thank you!
- Laughs

Once you get settled, Mike
wants to have a meeting

with you and all the other
sales reps this afternoon.

Okay, cool. Thanks, Connie.

Congratulations, Fiona.
You remind me of me.

Hi, this is Fiona with worldwide cup.

This is what you missed last
week on Shameless. Spits

Is your mom not pregnant again?

Every time she pees on
a stick, it's bad news.

And then I get depressed
thinking about my husband

banging my mom 'cause we
selfishly want to have a baby

with some of our DNA.

Attention, people! Kevin
is gonna be a daddy!

Why, is Mandy going a little
cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran
over Karen with her car.

- I can't feel.
- Mandy did this?

Because of me, you ruined Karen's life!

When I was your age, my pop
took me on my first heist.

My foster gays have a lot of nice stuff.

Whoa, can I help you?

We have reason to believe
this child may have robbed

his former foster parents.

He didn't do the heist. I did. Cuff me.

That whore that Mickey is marrying

is an actual whore that
works at Garden Springs spa.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean we can't still bang.

I need a change.

I hear reports of, um, medical school.

Yeah, I may have to spend
some more time in Michigan.

What?

Have you signed up for classes already?

Technically I'm enrolled.

And when was the last
time you saw my daughter?

- Uh, two days ago.
- I saw her three hours ago.

In I.N.S. holding.

It will be dealt with.

You have known from day one

what you were getting into with me.

Right, I got sucked into your world.

I bent to your rules.

You made me feel like
I could depend on you.

Be a man. Get onto the boat.

Hey, it's me. I love you.

High strung's the luck you got

I can't even put my hands on a goddamn oxy.

- Flossing's for fags.

Jackass, what are you doing
with a water gun in the house?

'Cause I don't have a paintball gun.

Actually, that kind of makes sense.

Gonna need a paintball gun

Uh, no.

Hell survivors paintball

outside Ann Arbor.

- We're not going to Michigan.
- We're not?

- Fiona said we were.
- Yup.

That's when Jimmy was here.
You seen him around lately?

Exactly.

- Did Fiona and Jimmy break up?
- I don't know.

Fiona barks at me every time I bring it up.

But I picked a fight with Becky Alexander

because I thought I was never
gonna have to see her again.

- See who again?
- That a new look for work?

Maybe if I was working
the street corner, yeah.

But since I'm doing data
entry, I better put this on.

- Yeah, whatever.
- No, it's not a "whatever."

First Gallagher kid getting his diploma.

- It's a big deal.
- Who'd you buy it from?

He's getting it fair and square and setting

a good example for both
of you, so pay attention.

We have to go to some stupid ceremony?

Nope, I'm picking up my diploma

at the guidance office and
getting the hell out of there.

There's no ceremony in the fall.

He'll walk with everyone in the spring.

- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

And we'll all be there to
yell, "Lip!" and embarrass him.

- Morning.
- Wow, Ian, looking sharp.

- Thanks.
- What, you got ROTC

on the last day before Christmas break?

Yeah, they're having some
sort of winter ceremony.

No more talk of Michigan.

Yo! G.I. Jane, slow down.

- Hey.

Glad to see you out of bed.

Thought we were gonna have
to put you on a suicide watch,

take away your shoelaces and bed sheets.

No need. Moved on.

How many times you gotta hear no, right?

Yeah. Well, uh, I guess the good thing

about falling for Mickey Milkovich

is you know you can
always find someone better.

Aw. Catch up with you after school.

Right.

Hey, Fiona.

Why aren't you getting ready for school?

I am ready.

We only have a half day anyway.

Gonna stop by Sheila's after.
Karen and Jody are moving today.

Groans Oh.

So you think Jimmy's
still gonna buy me braces

when he's done with med school?

Jimmy can't always be

the answer to our problems, Debbie.

- Everything okay with you guys?
- What?

Lip said we're not moving to Michigan.

Lip should mind his own business.

- It is his business.
- What?

To move to Michigan or not.

It is his business.
It's all of our business.

- School. Now.
- But you didn't answer me.

Are we or are we not moving to Michigan?

I don't know! Okay? I don't know!

And I promise that you're
gonna be the first person

that I tell when I do know, okay?

Leave the adult problems to the adults.

Oh, so it's fine for me to be an adult

when it comes to saving this
family from losing this house

by falsely accusing a
relative of molesting me.

But when I want to know

where we're gonna be
living for the next year,

then I'm just supposed to be a kid

and keep my mouth shut, right?

- Yeah.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

You obviously don't
feel the same way. Fine.

But at least have the decency to tell me.

Okay? Two years? I think I deserve that.

Have a good life. Fucking asshole!

- You're not Morgan Fairchild.
- Excuse me?

Heaven.

I always imagined absinthe
and Morgan Fairchild.

I'm Dr. Markman, and you're not dead.

But you will be soon if
you don't stop drinking.

You got anything for the pain?

Vicodin, Percocet, whatever's handy.

You have liver damage, esophageal varices,

immune system dysfunction,
likely renal failure.

Frankly, it would be faster to
tell you what you don't have.

Maybe the online medical school

you graduated from didn't cover this

before they emailed you your diploma.

I'm going to try to make this simple.

The technical term is "withdrawal."

I like the word "parched."

So if there's not a keg handy,

a bottle of your finest pharmaceuticals

should have me ship-shape in no time.

- You need to stop drinking.
- Spare me the sermon.

Are you interested in

- Active duty. Full-time.
- All right.

I'd be happy to help you find a specialty,

let you know when they're classing up.

I don't want to wait for a specialty.

I'm ready to leave now.

Any reason why you're seeking out the army?

Trouble at home?

Nope. It's a surprise.

from what's his name?

Do you want to give me
a hand with the banner?

Oh, I guess that's my
cue to get more coffee.

He didn't even have the
balls to dump me in person.

He told you who he was from the beginning.

Car thief. Lied about his name for months.

- Your point?
- Sorry.

No. I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be a bitch about it.

He's a wuss, forget about him.

He's forgotten.

Just pissed I wasted two years of my life.

- You guys aren't being fair.
- What?

Did you or did you not tell
Jimmy the last time you saw him

- not to come home?
- So?

Well, now you're mad at him
for doing exactly what you said?

She didn't mean it.

- Yeah, I did.
- Aah!

Yeah, but just for that night, not forever.

I didn't think he'd take it for real.

Why not?

Because that's what women
do in the heat of the moment.

- We say shit we don't mean.
- I got it.

But how the fuck is he
supposed to know that?

Just go get the car, Kev.

We're gonna be late for the baby doctor.

Okay, fine, but how do I know
you really mean go get the car?

You could be saying, "go get the car,"

in the heat of the moment.

you didn't have a wheelchair and... and...

a big... scar on your head.

Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.

I'm surprised to see
you. Are you feeling okay?

Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

Oh.

How's Ian?

Fine.

I was wondering if you'd seen Jimmy lately?

How long?

Almost a week.

You two are having problems?

Things have been a
little rough lately, yeah.

Any sign of conflict or
things not going his way,

and he just... disappears.

Gone.

- Chipotle?
- What?

I always have my hot dog
with a little chipotle sauce.

- You want some?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

Rosa, two specials. Chipotle.

It's what he does. I've gotten used to it.

At least as used to it as
a father can when his son

doesn't call or email for months at a time.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Maybe this time's different?

Absolutely.

Yeah, you never know, right?

I should get back to work.

You'll be fine.

Thanks for the hot dog.

All right, there we go.
There's the little peach pit.

Holy crap, there he is!

He looks just like you, baby.

He kind of does, doesn't he?

Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl, doc?

12 weeks is too early to
tell. Give it another month.

12 weeks? That's impossible.

But we only started trying 12 weeks ago.

Then it must have happened
on the first go-around.

Let me print this up, and
I'll let you get dressed.

Ooh, yeah, that's weird.

tells me when I'm pregnant.

You know, it's never been wrong before.

Wonder what happened this time.

- What are you doing?
- ROTC retreat.

- Since when?
- Last minute.

- Hey, where's my knife?
- I don't know.

Carl, my S.O.G. Seal team.
It's the best fixed blade I got.

Sighs

My samurai sword broke. Need
a backup till it's fixed.

Yeah.

What if the zombie apocalypse
goes down while you're gone?

Who's gonna protect Debbie and Liam?

- Fine, keep it.
- Really?

Yeah, just promise you're not
gonna use it on anything human.

- Cats aren't human.
- Anything living. Promise.

Promise. Can you teach me
the different hand grips?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

- Hold on, now.
- 12 weeks pregnant!

Veronica, I promise. I swear I had no idea.

Ladies, please.

Hey, V, come on, that's not right.

Although, hey, I should
probably record this

in case we want to upload it to our site,

make some money, just watch her
belly if you're gonna hit her.

12 weeks, Kev?

Just trying to keep the peace, baby.

Honey, I promise, I didn't know!

Please, you always know.

You're like a walking pee stick!

Yeah, in the past, but this time...

There is no "this time."

You kept quiet 'cause you wanted
to keep fucking my husband!

What the fuck are you looking at, huh?

My husband fucked my
mother to get pregnant.

Sorry we can't all have
our baby the normal way!

Hey, what can I say?

Once you go white, you always stay tight.

Hey, I think I just insulted myself.

- Mom, admit it.
- Okay.

Okay, I thought I might be pregnant!

- Oh, my God.
- No, but, honey.

Look, I didn't know.

I didn't take a test or anything.

- I didn't want to know.
- What? Why?

Because I liked what we had.

- Thank you.
- Excuse me?

No, not what we, me and
Kev had, what we all had.

- What are you talking about?
- Been feeling so lonely lately.

And when you called me to help out,

it made me feel wanted...

wanted in a loving way, in a family way,

needed, important.

High-pitched Hey, I'm your baby fetus.

Please don't fight anymore.

I know Kev is a big, hot stud,

and you couldn't resist
his giant cock penis.

But I'm all that matters now, right?

Groans What does it take
to get a refill around here?

Jacket and tie would probably help.

This is nice. We don't
spend enough time together.

No, we don't spend any time together.

Exactly my point.

You know, son, you can always come to me.

Thanks, dad.

- I worry about you.
- Is that right?

A parent's plight never goes away,

no matter how old your kid gets.

Look at you, 18 now.

A high school graduate.

Where the fuck is that waiter?

Don't go getting misty-eyed on me now.

Grunts

Need any words of fatherly advice?

- No, I think I got it covered.
- Oh, come on, come on!

What's on your mind?

Okay, why not? Day
couldn't get any weirder.

Um, I'm done with school.

I have no idea what I'm gonna do

today or tomorrow

or for the rest of my life.

So no plans?

No.

Good for you. You're just like me.

We march to the beat
of a different drummer.

Everyone will try to cage you in,

tell you you have to
worry about your future.

You know what your future should be?

This... living life to the fullest,

every day like it's your last.

This place is single-handedly
lowering my tolerance.

Let's hit the liquor store.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, um, you really think

they deserve your hard-earned
money for that service?

- Dine and dash?
- Bite and bolt.

- Eat it and beat it?
- I'll take the front door.

Excuse me, amigo, uh, bano?

Gracias.

Excuse me, I gotta take this call.

- Can we see a dessert menu?
- Of course.

Hey, Fiona, missed you at lunch.

What are all these people
doing outside Mike's office?

- Job applicants.
- Thanks so much, man, okay?

We'll talk to you later this week.

You bet.

Hi. Uh, sorry. Can I
talk to you for a second?

Yeah, uh, sure. Clears throat

- There's a job opening up?
- Yeah.

Rick from sales is moving
to our Columbus office.

Well, I want it.

No, I need somebody with experience.

Chuckles

This is about our night in the tent.

- I can assure you it is not.
- But I've been here for months.

My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.

I would love to keep you around,

but Uncle Matt's not
gonna let me hire someone

who doesn't have a proven track record.

Which all those people out there do, okay?

Listen, if you had one sale on the books,

this would be a different conversation.

I've pushed cocktails, that's sales.

Wait, weren't you moving to Michigan?

I mean, you wanted to work
in our Ann Arbor office.

And I convinced all those customers

you thought you lost to re-up.

You got them on the hook, but
it was the sales department

that closed the deals. Sighs

Hey.

You've been a great asset to this company.

I'm really sorry.

I remember the first
time I brought you here.

Fuck you! You never took me skating.

Always took you skating,
to the park, to the zoo.

You tried to make off with a tortoise.

That was you.

Huh. Good market in endangered species.

That's 'cause it's illegal, Frank.

- Bleeding heart eco-fascist.
- Chuckles

It's called survival of
the fittest for a reason.

You don't want to be
endangered, speed the fuck up!

- Laughs
- Grow some opposable thumbs!

Otherwise you end up on eBay for 10 grand,

as Darwin intended.

Coughs

Uh-oh!

Grunts All right.

- More for a rhino.
- What?

Horn. Pay a king's ransom in Asia.

Grind it into powder.
Morons say it cures cancer.

Also tiger dick.

They take a couple of bites,
and they think it turns them

into fuck machines. Laughter

I'm not making this shit up!

Oh, shit! This is slippery. Whoo!

- I'm gonna... shit!
- All right.

Okay, here we go. Here we go.

Laughter

- We should do this more often.
- Afternoon drinking buddies?

We could hit the zoo tomorrow. Steal it.

- What?
- The rhino horn.

Do it together.

- You're fucking wasted.
- Alcohol provides clarity.

We hide in the bird
sanctuary until closing.

We drug the rhino.

Once it's down, a quick
back and forth with the saw.

And we're a few clicks
away from a bidding war.

What do you say?

- Coughing
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

You're not some co-ed on spring break.

Gallaghers do not puke! Oh, stop!

- Vomiting
- Oh!

- Vomiting continues
- Oh, God.

Domino effect!

- Laughs
- Whoa!

Hey!

You two are out of here right now!

- He okay?
- Frank? Frank!

Barry, I need an ambulance.

Can I help you?

Dude, don't you know it's not cool

to rush a woman alone on the street?

He wanted you to have this.

Who? What the hell is that?

The man who lived here with you.

Jimmy?

Wait! Hey, wait!

Was he here? Where is he?

Hey, did he say anything else?

Yes, he said you were too good for him.

He has moved on. Now so must you.

Engine starts

Hey!

Come on! Hey!

Cell phone rings

Lip, what's going on?

Hi, I'm Fiona Gallagher.

My father Frank Gallagher
was just admitted.

- Let me check.
- What's wrong with him?

Sighs You mean this time?
I wouldn't worry, it's Frank.

- I bet he has cancer.
- Only if there's money in it.

First left, fourth door on the right.

Thanks.

Stay here, okay?

- What?
- No.

Yes, I'll tell you as
soon as I know anything.

No, I'm sick of you treating
me like a little baby.

- Me too.
- Okay. Go wait in the lobby.

Now!

Sighs

Hey, uh, were you just
in there with my father?

- Francis Gallagher?
- I was.

Well, can you tell me what's going on?

Just broke the news to
him. Took it in stride.

Although I don't think
he's truly accepting it yet.

What... what news? Took what in stride?

Rock music

Under $100.

Knock on door

- Hi, there.
- Hey! I'm glad you're here.

Try to get me some more of
these pudding cups, would you?

- No! Don't mention food!
- Oh, Jesus, Lip! Really?

It smells like a distillery in there.

Celebrating my graduation.

Getting drunk in the
middle of the day with him?

Are you an idiot? Laughs

Please save the mommy
lecture for tomorrow, please,

when my head isn't pounding so much.

Get up, get home. Get sober.

We're planning a surprise party for you.

It's not a surprise, I already knew.

Well, Debbie and Carl
are waiting in the lobby.

So take them with you. Groans

This isn't gonna be fun.

Yeah, and grab your surprise ice cream cake

out of the freezer and start defrosting it.

- Okay.
- Chuckles

Three raw eggs, worcestershire,
and a sliver of ginger.

Works every time. Coughs

Jesus. No HBO, no
Showtime. Just basic cable.

And what the hell is a Tosh 2.0?

- The doctor talk to you, Frank?
- Yeah.

"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, stop drinking.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

He told me you were really sick.

Do I look really sick to you?

Said you were throwing up blood.

That's 'cause I've got
too much of it in me.

It's a filtration process.

My body knows how to flush itself out.

Stop joking. This is serious.

It's just doctor mumbo jumbo

to scare you into taking more tests.

- Fucking parasites.
- What are you doing?

- I gotta use the can.
- Well, let's get the nurse.

I don't like the one
that's on duty. She's fat.

Roll that thing behind me, will you?

Grunts

Sighs

He said if you don't stop
drinking, you're gonna die.

As in dead, you know,

like, no longer living? And soon.

Urinating When did you start to care?

Not sure that I do.

I've dreamt about your death.

Put money in a collection
box and prayed for it.

Blew out my birthday
candles, wished for it.

If it actually ever happened,

I don't know if I'd feel relief or guilt.

Chuckles Your birthday candles?

Laughs

I wrote a letter to Santa once.

Laughs

So I'm supposed to stop drinking

so that you don't feel guilty?

No.

You're supposed to stop
drinking because you have

children at home who love you.

And I don't know why.

Who would be destroyed if
anything happened to you.

Tragedy makes kids tough, Fiona.

Then be the fabulous
narcissist that you are,

and do it for yourself.

What if I don't want to change?

Then I would know what
I've always feared is true.

What is that?

That you don't give a shit about any of us.

So do it for you.

Do it for your kids.

It doesn't matter.

Do it.

Hey, where were you today?
I didn't see you at school.

Something came up.

They gave us homework
over the Christmas break.

I told Mrs. Stoltz that Jesus
didn't want us celebrating

his birthday by fucking reading.

You want the assignments?

- Just came by to see you.
- Who's at the goddamn door?

It's for me, shithead!

Got some nitrous. I'll go get it.

Hey.

Up to four sets of 20.

Get in here. I want to show you something.

Come on. Come check it out.

Wife made me take all my Nazi shit down.

She hates Nazis.

Apparently the Russians
kicked some serious kraut ass

in world war II, so...

She can drink me under
the fucking table, man.

It's weird.

Anyways...

she's working tomorrow night.

Why don't we pick up where we left off?

Figure she's gonna be out fucking dudes.

Why can't I?

No, thanks.

Mm. Hard to get's getting
me hard, Gallagher.

I'm, uh, leaving town.

There a queer rights rally somewhere?

Army.

Ah! Right. You gotta be 18.

Yeah, I figured a way around that.

You serious? You're signing up?

Tomorrow morning.

That's a dumb-ass fucking move. How long?

Four years. Minimum.

What are you hoping, I tell you not to go?

I'm gonna chase after you like some bitch?

Didn't come here for you.

Don't.

- Don't what?
- Just...

I got the nitrous. Meet you outside.

Yeah.

What the fuck do you want?

Really? That's all you're gonna say to him?

You're a fucking pussy.

- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, I fed Liam.

And put him down a half an hour ago.

- Thanks.
- How's daddy?

- Is he okay?
- Sighs That's up to him.

What does that mean?

We should be at the
hospital helping him out.

- He needs to help himself.
- What?

What's up with taking down the decorations?

Lip told us to.

No one feels much like a party.

Hey, sometimes life throws
a couple swings at you.

But we're Gallaghers, okay?

And there's two things
that we're really good at...

knowing how to get back up
and knowing how to party.

So you get the tape, start
hanging up that banner.

And you go get Kev and V.

Sheila, start taking the food back out.

I'll get Lip. Whoo!

Knock on door

Hungry?

- Don't.
- Chicken pot pie.

- God, seriously.
- Sloppy Joes.

- Stop, Fiona.
- Serves you right.

Hell of a way to start
life after graduation.

- Where is it?
- What?

The piece of paper.

Mm. Clears throat

I wasn't actually sure you'd ever get this.

That makes two of us.

I'm proud of you.

I came into some money.

Bury the lead, why don't you?

I put a bunch away for rent and gas,

but there's something I
want to do with the rest.

Please don't tell me you're gonna promote

another club night,
okay? I'm nauseous enough.

Mm, something else.

Could get a full-time job out of it.

If I say okay, will you
close the fucking door?

- You're wanted downstairs.
- I got the spins, Fi.

Get it together and put
a smile on your face.

Debbie and Carl need motivation.

Come on, everyone's waiting.

Sighs Okay.

- Walk forward.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay.

And...

All: Surprise!

are delicious, Sheila.

Oh.

I was thinking about some fun things

we could do tomorrow together.

Oh, um, actually,
Veronica was gonna take me

- to the skating rink.
- Oh.

I really enjoy hanging
out with you, Sheila,

but now that there's an empty nest,

maybe it's a good time for you

to start making some new friends

closer to your own age
who share your interests.

Maybe.

Whoa! Screaming

an early baby shower gift.

I need you to order a couple thousand cups

Cups? It's a bar, not a frat party.

We drink out of glasses and mugs.

Where did you get this from?

Tell them I convinced you to do it.

Okay.

What's going on?

Chuckles Nice. Best cure for a hangover.

Sweet.

Thanks.

Where the fuck's he going? Door closes

We're not moving to Michigan.

I wanted you to be the first to know.

Jimmy's gone for good?

Mm-hmm.

But there's a chance I might get a new job.

- At the cup company.
- Maybe.

That's great.

Don't tell anybody about
it unless it happens, okay?

Comes with benefits.

Dental?

For me too?

Well, don't blow it. Get the job.

I'll try.

We can order your business cards.

This is what you missed last
week on Shameless. Spits

Is your mom not pregnant again?

Every time she pees on
a stick, it's bad news.

And then I get depressed
thinking about my husband

banging my mom 'cause we
selfishly want to have a baby

with some of our DNA.

Attention, people! Kevin
is gonna be a daddy!

Why, is Mandy going a little
cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

Yeah, I think she ran
over Karen with her car.

is an actual whore that
works at Garden Springs spa.

You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

doesn't mean we can't still bang.

I hear reports of, um, medical school.

Yeah, I may have to spend
some more time in Michigan.

What?

Have you signed up for classes already?

Technically I'm enrolled.

And when was the last
time you saw my daughter?

- Uh, two days ago.
- I saw her three hours ago.

Karen and Jody are moving today.

Groans Oh.

So you think Jimmy's
still gonna buy me braces

when he's done with med school?

Jimmy can't always be

the answer to our problems, Debbie.

- Everything okay with you guys?
- What?

Lip said we're not moving to Michigan.

Lip should mind his own business.

- It is his business.
- What?

To move to Michigan or not.

It is his business.
It's all of our business.

- School. Now.
- But you didn't answer me.

Are we or are we not moving to Michigan?

I don't know! Okay? I don't know!

And I promise that you're
gonna be the first person

that I tell when I do know, okay?

Leave the adult problems to the adults.

Oh, so it's fine for me to be an adult

when it comes to saving this
family from losing this house

by falsely accusing a
relative of molesting me.

But when I want to know

where we're gonna be
living for the next year,

then I'm just supposed to be a kid

and keep my mouth shut, right?

- Yeah.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

Phone ringing

It's Steve. Leave some words.

Beep Seriously?

I leave you a message saying
that I want to work it out,

and you don't even call me back?

Okay, fine. I get it.

You obviously don't
feel the same way. Fine.

But at least have the decency to tell me.

Okay? Two years? I think I deserve that.

Have a good life. Fucking asshole!

- You're not Morgan Fairchild.
- Excuse me?

Heaven.

I always imagined absinthe
and Morgan Fairchild.

I'm Dr. Markman, and you're not dead.

But you will be soon if
you don't stop drinking.

You got anything for the pain?

Vicodin, Percocet, whatever's handy.

You have liver damage, esophageal varices,

immune system dysfunction,
likely renal failure.

Frankly, it would be faster to
tell you what you don't have.

Maybe the online medical school

you graduated from didn't cover this

before they emailed you your diploma.

I'm going to try to make this simple.

The technical term is "withdrawal."

I like the word "parched."

So if there's not a keg handy,

a bottle of your finest pharmaceuticals

should have me ship-shape in no time.

- You need to stop drinking.
- Spare me the sermon.

Juan will take you to processing.

- Processing?
- You're being released.

What?

If we keep you here,
we'd have to treat you.

Stop drinking before it kills you.

Coughing Grunts

Aah! Fuck.

Hit me, Kate.

Thought I was the only one here into that.

No time for flirting, got
some catching up to do.

Line 'em up.

Bluegrass music



- Morning.
- I want to enlist.

Glad to hear it.

Are you interested in
active duty or army reserve?

- Active duty. Full-time.
- All right.

I'd be happy to help you find a specialty,

let you know when they're classing up.

I don't want to wait for a specialty.

I'm ready to leave now.

Any reason why you're seeking out the army?

Trouble at home?

Running away from jail
or a pregnant girlfriend?

Here's my transcript.

I already passed the
vocational aptitude battery

and physical exams.

When's the next bus to
basic combat training?

Tomorrow morning.

- What else do I need?
- Photo I.D.

I'll be here.

Hey, take some time to think on it.

I'm ready now.

So does he know we're
having a party for him?

Nope. It's a surprise.

Men don't give a shit about this stuff.

Well, it's a big deal.

First Gallagher kid getting a diploma.

Hey, what about you?

- G.E.D. doesn't really count.
- Diplomas are overrated.

I didn't get a diploma, and look at me.

Mimicking veronica Hey,
don't give me no shit, Kev!

- I do not sound like that.
- Popping

Oh! Give me those! You
better watch yourself.

Laughs Ow!

How would you like it if I did that to you?

Growls Screams Don't bite! No!

Laughs

So still haven't heard
from what's his name?

Do you want to give me
a hand with the banner?

Oh, I guess that's my
cue to get more coffee.

He didn't even have the
balls to dump me in person.

He told you who he was from the beginning.

Car thief. Lied about his name for months.

- Your point?
- Sorry.

No. I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be a bitch about it.

He's a wuss, forget about him.

He's forgotten.

Just pissed I wasted two years of my life.

- You guys aren't being fair.
- What?

Did you or did you not tell
Jimmy the last time you saw him

- not to come home?
- So?

Well, now you're mad at him
for doing exactly what you said?

She didn't mean it.

- Yeah, I did.
- Aah!

Yeah, but just for that night, not forever.

I didn't think he'd take it for real.

Why not?

Because that's what women
do in the heat of the moment.

- We say shit we don't mean.
- I got it.

But how the fuck is he
supposed to know that?

Just go get the car, Kev.

We're gonna be late for the baby doctor.

Okay, fine, but how do I know
you really mean go get the car?

You could be saying, "go get the car,"

in the heat of the moment.

Crazy time of year, end of semester.

I have to let a litany
of underachievers know

they'd best be advised to cut their losses

and learn a trade, something
that utilizes their backs

instead of their brains. Chuckles

It's moments like this
that make the job worth it.

Crap pay, miserable working conditions,

but the chance to change
one special kid's life.

Congratulations.

Wow.

Guess this is where I'm
supposed to, uh, thank you

for never giving up on me.

- Chuckles
- Well.

I'll see ya, Dick. Sighs

Teachers are taking bets
what's next for you, Gallagher.

College, ten to one. Prison, four to one.

Hey, Kate, can I get a shot?

And enable your truancy?

This place is pathetic enough already.

I'm not skipping school.

Surprisingly, they let me graduate.

Good for you. This one's on the house.

Thanks.

I know what you're
thinking. You can tap that.

And you'd be right. But chew on this.

Sure, she's got some
frisky tricks up her sleeve,

but there's more tread on
those tires than it's worth.

Trust me, been there.

Planted my flag and I got
the piss pins and needles

to prove it.

I thought you were in jail, Frank.

Got out on a technicality.

Why did you take the rap for Carl?

Because that's what family does.

- Have I taught you nothing?
- Congratulations.

- Thank you.
- Congra... what for?

Your kid got his diploma.

My boy!

Why didn't you say something?
We need to celebrate.

Attention! Grunts

Denizens of this dump!

- Frank, you okay?
- Better than ever!

Because my progeny has joined
the ranks of the graduated!

Cheers and applause

Which makes official
something we've long known,

which is that the Gallaghers
are head and shoulders above

all of you shitbirds! Crowd grumbling

Seriously, Frank, you look like crap.

Even for you. You're one to talk, Tommy.

You're one bucket of kfc extra crispy away

from giving precious a run for her money.

Laughter Oh!

You know I got a fucking
thyroid condition...

Chuckles Oh.

And I could still kick your ass.

Well, why don't you put your money

where your halitosis-ridden mouth is.

Hey, I'm not mopping up the
blood and the teeth again.

Figure out another way to
settle your pissing contest.

- Fine, pissing contest!
- Fine!

Let's go!

Hey, I didn't mean it literally!

Pushups!

Scoffs You won't make double digits.

What does it matter?

You can't count that high anyway.

- Oh, I want in on this!
- Me too!

Let's do it! Push these tables aside.

- Hold on.
- Make a hole.

No girlie, on-your-knees push-ups.

Only one of us spends
time on their knees, Frank,

and it ain't me.

- Laughs
- Okay, 10 bucks in.

My kid will hold. 20!

Thank you. Overlapping chatter

Thank you, thank you.
All right, no food stamps.

But lottery scratchers are accepted.

Okay. All right, we're ready.

Get set!

And go!

One, two,

three, four... All grunting

Five, six, seven...

- Coughing
- Eight, nine!

Tommy!

Coughing

11, 12!

Know what kind of upper body strength

it takes to handle a rig, Gallagher?

I can do this all day.

Not just a test of strength but stamina.

The kind one gets from
years of running from people,

not sitting on your ass in
a truck for 18 hours a day.

Grunts

27, 28, 29, 30,

31, 32! Uh-oh.

All shouting

Laughs

Um, there you go, uh, drink responsibly.

Scoffs

Hey, Kate, can I get another shot?

Hey, wanna go celebrate?

- Uh...
- A steak.

- No.
- Aw, come on!

You got something better to do?

Make it a scotch and a lobster,

you got yourself a deal.

All right!

Sighs

Alternative music



Phone rings

It's Steve. Leave some words.

Beep Chuckles

So you just never pick up anymore, huh?

Hi. It's Fiona.

Fiona Gallagher. Remember me?

We used to date.

Maybe we still do.

I left you a message this morning.

You should probably just delete that.

Chuckles

You know that thing I
said about not coming home?

I didn't mean it.

I mean, I did mean it.
Just for that night though.

Not forever, silly.

Sorry if I wasn't clear about that.

Give me a call.

I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Okay, so I've got little baggies

of dried nuts and blueberries,
which are good brain food.

Great, mom, but I'm pretty sure

they have all that stuff in Sedona.

Yes, but it's 1,642 miles
if you take scenic I-40.

Bye, Hymie. It's been nice knowing you.

Grunts And you have to look up Shiva Ray.

Remember I told you about him?

He's the medicine man that lives in Sedona.

I read about him online.

He cured this woman's ovarian cancer

by giving her wheatgrass douches.

- Great, I'll look her up.
- Him. He's a him.

- Shiva Ray. Him.
- I'll look him up.

Okay.

Grunts All right. This is it.

Oh, my goodness.

I know I agreed to
this, but it doesn't mean

it's not hard to say good-bye

to my baby.

Both my babies.

All three of my babies!

Bye, baby. Cries

Shh. Okay.

- Cries
- It's okay, it's okay.

Sighs

My sweet Karen.

I knew this day would come,

when I'd be saying a
proper good-bye to you.

It didn't really look like this though.

You didn't...

you didn't have a wheelchair and... and...

a big... scar on your head.

I know I have to let you go.

Goodbye.

Just stop it. No more good-byes.

Just see you soon.

- See you soon.
- See you soon!

- See you soon.
- See you soon!

Baby.

We'll call you when we get settled in.

Okay. Go heal my baby.

I will.

- Sniffles
- Bye, baby.

Door closes Bye, baby.

Engine starting

Bye, honey!

Bye! Bye!

Love you!

Want me to make you
some macaroni and cheese?

Uh, I have to finish
getting the house ready

for Lip's party.

Let me grab my coat. I can come help.

Sure.

So don't worry, I'll make sure

that you have everything you need.

Dr. Lishman?

Fiona. Hi.

Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.

I'm surprised to see
you. Are you feeling okay?

Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

Oh.

How's Ian?

Fine.

I was wondering if you'd seen Jimmy lately?

How long?

Almost a week.

You two are having problems?

Things have been a
little rough lately, yeah.

Any sign of conflict or
things not going his way,

and he just... disappears.

Gone.

- Chipotle?
- What?

I always have my hot dog
with a little chipotle sauce.

- You want some?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

Rosa, two specials. Chipotle.

It's what he does. I've gotten used to it.

At least as used to it as
a father can when his son

doesn't call or email for months at a time.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Maybe this time's different?

Absolutely.

Yeah, you never know, right?

I should get back to work.

You'll be fine.

Thanks for the hot dog.

All right, there we go.
There's the little peach pit.

Holy crap, there he is!

He looks just like you, baby.

He kind of does, doesn't he?

Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl, doc?

12 weeks is too early to
tell. Give it another month.

12 weeks? That's impossible.

But we only started trying 12 weeks ago.

Then it must have happened
on the first go-around.

Let me print this up, and
I'll let you get dressed.

Ooh, yeah, that's weird.

Chuckles My body usually
tells me when I'm pregnant.

You know, it's never been wrong before.

Wonder what happened this time.

- What are you doing?
- ROTC retreat.

- Since when?
- Last minute.

- Hey, where's my knife?
- I don't know.

Carl, my S.O.G. Seal team.
It's the best fixed blade I got.

Sighs

My samurai sword broke. Need
a backup till it's fixed.

Yeah.

What if the zombie apocalypse
goes down while you're gone?

Who's gonna protect Debbie and Liam?

- Fine, keep it.
- Really?

Yeah, just promise you're not
gonna use it on anything human.

- Cats aren't human.
- Anything living. Promise.

Promise. Can you teach me
the different hand grips?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

- Hold on, now.
- 12 weeks pregnant!

Veronica, I promise. I swear I had no idea.

Ladies, please.

Hey, V, come on, that's not right.

Although, hey, I should
probably record this

in case we want to upload it to our site,

make some money, just watch her
belly if you're gonna hit her.

12 weeks, Kev?

Just trying to keep the peace, baby.

Honey, I promise, I didn't know!

Please, you always know.

You're like a walking pee stick!

Yeah, in the past, but this time...

There is no "this time."

You kept quiet 'cause you wanted
to keep fucking my husband!

What the fuck are you looking at, huh?

My husband fucked my
mother to get pregnant.

Sorry we can't all have
our baby the normal way!

Hey, what can I say?

Once you go white, you always stay tight.

Hey, I think I just insulted myself.

- Mom, admit it.
- Okay.

Okay, I thought I might be pregnant!

- Oh, my God.
- No, but, honey.

Look, I didn't know.

I didn't take a test or anything.

- I didn't want to know.
- What? Why?

Because I liked what we had.

- Thank you.
- Excuse me?

No, not what we, me and
Kev had, what we all had.

- What are you talking about?
- Been feeling so lonely lately.

And when you called me to help out,

it made me feel wanted...

wanted in a loving way, in a family way,

needed, important.

High-pitched Hey, I'm your baby fetus.

Please don't fight anymore.

I know Kev is a big, hot stud,

and you couldn't resist
his giant cock penis.

But I'm all that matters now, right?

Groans What does it take
to get a refill around here?

Jacket and tie would probably help.

This is nice. We don't
spend enough time together.

No, we don't spend any time together.

Exactly my point.

You know, son, you can always come to me.

Thanks, dad.

- I worry about you.
- Is that right?

A parent's plight never goes away,

no matter how old your kid gets.

Look at you, 18 now.

A high school graduate.

Where the fuck is that waiter?

Don't go getting misty-eyed on me now.

Grunts

Need any words of fatherly advice?

- No, I think I got it covered.
- Oh, come on, come on!

What's on your mind?

Okay, why not? Day
couldn't get any weirder.

Um, I'm done with school.

I have no idea what I'm gonna do

today or tomorrow

or for the rest of my life.

So no plans?

No.

Good for you. You're just like me.

We march to the beat
of a different drummer.

Everyone will try to cage you in,

tell you you have to
worry about your future.

You know what your future should be?

This... living life to the fullest,

every day like it's your last.

This place is single-handedly
lowering my tolerance.

Let's hit the liquor store.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, um, you really think

they deserve your hard-earned
money for that service?

- Dine and dash?
- Bite and bolt.

- Eat it and beat it?
- I'll take the front door.

Excuse me, amigo, uh, bano?

Gracias.

Excuse me, I gotta take this call.

- Can we see a dessert menu?
- Of course.

Hey, Fiona, missed you at lunch.

What are all these people
doing outside Mike's office?

- Job applicants.
- Thanks so much, man, okay?

We'll talk to you later this week.

You bet.

Hi. Uh, sorry. Can I
talk to you for a second?

Yeah, uh, sure. Clears throat

- There's a job opening up?
- Yeah.

Rick from sales is moving
to our Columbus office.

Well, I want it.

No, I need somebody with experience.

Chuckles

This is about our night in the tent.

- I can assure you it is not.
- But I've been here for months.

My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.

I would love to keep you around,

but Uncle Matt's not
gonna let me hire someone

who doesn't have a proven track record.

Which all those people out there do, okay?

Listen, if you had one sale on the books,

this would be a different conversation.

I've pushed cocktails, that's sales.

Wait, weren't you moving to Michigan?

I mean, you wanted to work
in our Ann Arbor office.

And I convinced all those customers

you thought you lost to re-up.

You got them on the hook, but
it was the sales department

that closed the deals. Sighs

Hey.

You've been a great asset to this company.

I'm really sorry.

I remember the first
time I brought you here.

Fuck you! You never took me skating.

Always took you skating,
to the park, to the zoo.

You tried to make off with a tortoise.

That was you.

Huh. Good market in endangered species.

That's 'cause it's illegal, Frank.

- Bleeding heart eco-fascist.
- Chuckles

It's called survival of
the fittest for a reason.

You don't want to be
endangered, speed the fuck up!

- Laughs
- Grow some opposable thumbs!

Otherwise you end up on eBay for 10 grand,

as Darwin intended.

Coughs

Uh-oh!

Grunts All right.

- More for a rhino.
- What?

Horn. Pay a king's ransom in Asia.

Grind it into powder.
Morons say it cures cancer.

Also tiger dick.

They take a couple of bites,
and they think it turns them

into fuck machines. Laughter

I'm not making this shit up!

Oh, shit! This is slippery. Whoo!

- I'm gonna... shit!
- All right.

Okay, here we go. Here we go.

Laughter

- We should do this more often.
- Afternoon drinking buddies?

We could hit the zoo tomorrow. Steal it.

- What?
- The rhino horn.

Do it together.

- You're fucking wasted.
- Alcohol provides clarity.

We hide in the bird
sanctuary until closing.

We drug the rhino.

Once it's down, a quick
back and forth with the saw.

And we're a few clicks
away from a bidding war.

What do you say?

- Coughing
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

You're not some co-ed on spring break.

Gallaghers do not puke! Oh, stop!

- Vomiting
- Oh!

- Vomiting continues
- Oh, God.

Domino effect!

- Laughs
- Whoa!

Hey!

You two are out of here right now!

- He okay?
- Frank? Frank!

Barry, I need an ambulance.

Can I help you?

Dude, don't you know it's not cool

to rush a woman alone on the street?

He wanted you to have this.

Who? What the hell is that?

The man who lived here with you.

Jimmy?

Wait! Hey, wait!

Was he here? Where is he?

Hey, did he say anything else?

Yes, he said you were too good for him.

He has moved on. Now so must you.

Engine starts

Hey!

Come on! Hey!

Cell phone rings

Lip, what's going on?

Hi, I'm Fiona Gallagher.

My father Frank Gallagher
was just admitted.

- Let me check.
- What's wrong with him?

Sighs You mean this time?
I wouldn't worry, it's Frank.

- I bet he has cancer.
- Only if there's money in it.

First left, fourth door on the right.

Thanks.

Stay here, okay?

- What?
- No.

Yes, I'll tell you as
soon as I know anything.

No, I'm sick of you treating
me like a little baby.

- Me too.
- Okay. Go wait in the lobby.

Now!

Sighs

Hey, uh, were you just
in there with my father?

- Francis Gallagher?
- I was.

Well, can you tell me what's going on?

Just broke the news to
him. Took it in stride.

Although I don't think
he's truly accepting it yet.

What... what news? Took what in stride?

Rock music

Under $100.

Knock on door

- Hi, there.
- Hey! I'm glad you're here.

Try to get me some more of
these pudding cups, would you?

- No! Don't mention food!
- Oh, Jesus, Lip! Really?

It smells like a distillery in there.

Celebrating my graduation.

Getting drunk in the
middle of the day with him?

Are you an idiot? Laughs

Please save the mommy
lecture for tomorrow, please,

when my head isn't pounding so much.

Get up, get home. Get sober.

We're planning a surprise party for you.

It's not a surprise, I already knew.

Well, Debbie and Carl
are waiting in the lobby.

So take them with you. Groans

This isn't gonna be fun.

Yeah, and grab your surprise ice cream cake

out of the freezer and start defrosting it.

- Okay.
- Chuckles

Three raw eggs, worcestershire,
and a sliver of ginger.

Works every time. Coughs

Jesus. No HBO, no
Showtime. Just basic cable.

And what the hell is a Tosh 2.0?

- The doctor talk to you, Frank?
- Yeah.

"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, stop drinking.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

He told me you were really sick.

Do I look really sick to you?

Said you were throwing up blood.

That's 'cause I've got
too much of it in me.

It's a filtration process.

My body knows how to flush itself out.

Stop joking. This is serious.

It's just doctor mumbo jumbo

to scare you into taking more tests.

- Fucking parasites.
- What are you doing?

- I gotta use the can.
- Well, let's get the nurse.

I don't like the one
that's on duty. She's fat.

Roll that thing behind me, will you?

Grunts

Sighs

He said if you don't stop
drinking, you're gonna die.

As in dead, you know,

like, no longer living? And soon.

Urinating When did you start to care?

Not sure that I do.

I've dreamt about your death.

Put money in a collection
box and prayed for it.

Blew out my birthday
candles, wished for it.

If it actually ever happened,

I don't know if I'd feel relief or guilt.

Chuckles Your birthday candles?

Laughs

I wrote a letter to Santa once.

Laughs

So I'm supposed to stop drinking

so that you don't feel guilty?

No.

You're supposed to stop
drinking because you have

children at home who love you.

And I don't know why.

Who would be destroyed if
anything happened to you.

Tragedy makes kids tough, Fiona.

Then be the fabulous
narcissist that you are,

and do it for yourself.

What if I don't want to change?

Then I would know what
I've always feared is true.

What is that?

That you don't give a shit about any of us.

So do it for you.

Do it for your kids.

It doesn't matter.

Do it.

Upbeat rock music



 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Hey, where were you today?
I didn't see you at school.

Something came up.

They gave us homework
over the Christmas break.

I told Mrs. Stoltz that Jesus
didn't want us celebrating

his birthday by fucking reading.

You want the assignments?

- Just came by to see you.
- Who's at the goddamn door?

It's for me, shithead!

Got some nitrous. I'll go get it.

Hey.

Up to four sets of 20.

Get in here. I want to show you something.

Come on. Come check it out.

Wife made me take all my Nazi shit down.

She hates Nazis.

Apparently the Russians
kicked some serious kraut ass

in world war II, so...

She can drink me under
the fucking table, man.

It's weird.

Anyways...

she's working tomorrow night.

Why don't we pick up where we left off?

Figure she's gonna be out fucking dudes.

Why can't I?

No, thanks.

Mm. Hard to get's getting
me hard, Gallagher.

I'm, uh, leaving town.

There a queer rights rally somewhere?

Army.

Ah! Right. You gotta be 18.

Yeah, I figured a way around that.

You serious? You're signing up?

Tomorrow morning.

That's a dumb-ass fucking move. How long?

Four years. Minimum.

What are you hoping, I tell you not to go?

I'm gonna chase after you like some bitch?

Didn't come here for you.

Don't.

- Don't what?
- Just...

I got the nitrous. Meet you outside.

Yeah.

What the fuck do you want?

Really? That's all you're gonna say to him?

You're a fucking pussy.

- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, I fed Liam.

And put him down a half an hour ago.

- Thanks.
- How's daddy?

- Is he okay?
- Sighs That's up to him.

What does that mean?

We should be at the
hospital helping him out.

- He needs to help himself.
- What?

What's up with taking down the decorations?

Lip told us to.

No one feels much like a party.

Hey, sometimes life throws
a couple swings at you.

But we're Gallaghers, okay?

And there's two things
that we're really good at...

knowing how to get back up
and knowing how to party.

So you get the tape, start
hanging up that banner.

And you go get Kev and V.

Sheila, start taking the food back out.

I'll get Lip. Whoo!

Knock on door

Hungry?

- Don't.
- Chicken pot pie.

- God, seriously.
- Sloppy Joes.

- Stop, Fiona.
- Serves you right.

Hell of a way to start
life after graduation.

- Where is it?
- What?

The piece of paper.

Mm. Clears throat

I wasn't actually sure you'd ever get this.

That makes two of us.

I'm proud of you.

I came into some money.

Bury the lead, why don't you?

I put a bunch away for rent and gas,

but there's something I
want to do with the rest.

Please don't tell me you're gonna promote

another club night,
okay? I'm nauseous enough.

Mm, something else.

Could get a full-time job out of it.

If I say okay, will you
close the fucking door?

- You're wanted downstairs.
- I got the spins, Fi.

Get it together and put
a smile on your face.

Debbie and Carl need motivation.

Come on, everyone's waiting.

Sighs Okay.

- Walk forward.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay.

And...

All: Surprise!

Cheers and laughter

What's Sheila doing here?

Upbeat rock music

Cheers

Yeah! It's crab cakes.

Overlapping chatter

Party horn blows

Cheers and applause



You can educate our baby!

Eh, well, um...

I'm going to go with ambrosia.

The shrimp crab cakes
are delicious, Sheila.

Oh.

I was thinking about some fun things

we could do tomorrow together.

Oh, um, actually,
Veronica was gonna take me

- to the skating rink.
- Oh.

I really enjoy hanging
out with you, Sheila,

but now that there's an empty nest,

maybe it's a good time for you

to start making some new friends

closer to your own age
who share your interests.

Maybe.

Whoa! Screaming

Laughter Congratulations.

Debs, play some music. Get it going!

Rock music playing

Hey, Fi, good news, V and I came up

with a compromise on a name.

Amy if it's a girl,
D'Shawndre if it's a boy.

- Giggles
- What?

Please tell me this is
an early baby shower gift.

I need you to order a couple thousand cups

for the Alibi first thing in the morning.

Cups? It's a bar, not a frat party.

We drink out of glasses and mugs.

Where did you get this from?

Tell them I convinced you to do it.

Okay.

What's going on?

Chuckles Nice. Best cure for a hangover.

Sweet.

Thanks.

Where the fuck's he going? Door closes

Knock at door

Worried?

What's gonna happen to daddy?

He always finds a way.

We're not moving to Michigan.

I wanted you to be the first to know.

Jimmy's gone for good?

Mm-hmm.

But there's a chance I might get a new job.

- At the cup company.
- Maybe.

That's great.

Don't tell anybody about
it unless it happens, okay?

Comes with benefits.

Dental?

For me too?

Well, don't blow it. Get the job.

I'll try.

Jimbo Mathus's Haunted John

 Whoo, there's haunted
John, haunted John



 haunted John, haunted John



Buzzing

What's going on?

Shaving your head.

What? Razor clicks off

To let the sunrays in,
so they can heal you,

like they did with my cancer.

Sunrays. Right.

Won't take long.

Carry on.

Soft rock music

Faucet turns off

Hey, little man.

I'll send postcards, all right?

Knock on door

Coming.

Hello! Hi.

- Hi.
- Oh!

Debbie, Sonia, Terry.

Come in, come in.

Clears throat

- Gallagher?
- Yeah, thanks.

Sighs

And this little gem... or
should I say, giant gem,

is the black bullet stimulator.

And its cousin, the
silver bullet stimulator.

Now I recommend getting several of these

for your home, car, and travel needs.

I have one last item to show you.

This is the vanilla-scented
snug shrink cream.

Now, who needs help
filling out the order forms?

Just see...

Gasps Oh. Indistinct chatter

Um, here you go. Great.

Um, feel free to change the
name and... um, here you go.

And pen.

Rock music



This is the one I was telling you about.

This is Fiona Gallagher,
made the Alibi Room sale.

Good one. A sale in the books.

Yeah. Overnight, no less.

Let's give her a two-week trial, Mike.

- See if it works out.
- Laughs Thank you, sir.

Okay.

- Aah!
- Yay!

Here we go.

Pens, paper, and all the office supplies

you need are in the top drawer.

Your direct phone number
is listed on the call sheet.

You should record an outgoing message.

Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Clears throat Phillip?

It's Lip.

It's just Gallagher now. Get on.

Next.

We can order your business cards.

Whoohoo!

- Ah, thank you!
- Laughs

Once you get settled, Mike
wants to have a meeting

with you and all the other
sales reps this afternoon.

Okay, cool. Thanks, Connie.

Congratulations, Fiona.
You remind me of me.

22 years ago, I started
here, at that very desk.

 I come to life

 when the night is in

Hi, this is Fiona with worldwide cup.

How are you today?

I'm well, thank you, we've noticed that you

haven't renewed your order in a while.

 Going down, going down

 yeah, I'm going down to
the devil's playground

 hey, hey, hey, hey

Still awaiting final vote.

15 of these nominees have
been pending since last year.

18 of them have received
strong bipartisan support

from the Senate Judiciary Committee.

These are non-controversial
nominees that are due

the up or down vote for
the United States Senate.

And there is no justification
for the delay of the Senate

carrying out its
constitutional responsibility...

Fuck.

Knocks on door

Hey.

Hi, um...

Lord Huron's Ends of the Earth

Vocalizing



Vocalizing

It's a full ride.

Anyway, it wouldn't have
happened without you.

So...

thank you.

 Oh, there's the river
that winds on forever

 I'm gonna see where it leads

Are you gonna go?

 Oh, there's a mountain
that no man has mounted

 I'm gonna stand on the peak

 out there's a land
that time don't command

 wanna be the first to arrive

 no time for ponderin'
why I'm a-wanderin' on

 while we're both still alive

 to the ends of the earth,
would you follow me?



 there's a world that was meant

 for us to see

 to the ends of the earth,
would you follow me?



 well, if you want, I will
say my good-byes to thee



Phone rings

It's Steve. Leave some words.

Last message, I promise.

Wherever you are...

Bye.

 To the ends of the earth,
would you follow me?



 there's a world that
was meant for us to see



 to the ends of the earth,
would you follow me?



 well, if you want, I will
say my good-byes to thee



 I was ready to die for you, baby

 doesn't mean I'm ready to stay

 what good is living the
life you've been given

 if all you do is stand in one place?

 I'm on a river that winds on forever

 follow till I get where I'm going

 maybe I'm heading to die,
but I'm still gonna try

 I guess I'm going alone
