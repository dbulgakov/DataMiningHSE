<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

    Moody's said Marathon Oil Co's recent establishment of up

prolific Yates Field has significant negative implications for
USX's unsecured creditors.
    The company appears to have positioned its steel segment
for a return to profit by late 1987, Moody's added.
    Ratings lowered include those on USX's senior debt to BA-1
from BAA-3.

quarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln
dlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal
1986.
    The company said any decline would be due to expenses
related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current
quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of
the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.
    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales
will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.
    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in
late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early
April this year.
    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,
including conducting appraisals, in connection with the
acquisitions.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

<TITLE>DEAN FOODS &lt;DF> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.
    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've been
after for years," Douglas told analysts.

<TITLE>BROWN-FORMAN &lt;BFDB> SETS STOCK SPLIT, UPS PAYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brown-Forman Inc said its board
has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
in the company cash dividend.
    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and
continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.
    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
common shares would be effective March 13.
    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of
37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
    The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve
Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."

<TITLE>BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
February, bankers said.
    They declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place," one senior banker said.
    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in Venezuela.
    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

<TITLE>TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Gelb, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission report, which
says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
report made public today.
    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
and was denied credentials."
    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
won't do it again'?"
    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences," it said.
    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
reasons last month.
    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
being heroes," Tower told reporters.
    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
popularity is still relatively high.
    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
doing a good job as president.
    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
address next week.
    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
a dramatic turnaround.
    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
of the Senate to the Democrats.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of previously owned homes
dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors
(NAR) said.
    But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the
highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in
November 1978, the group said.
    "The drop in January is not surprising considering that a
significant portion of December's near-record pace was made up
of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment
under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.

<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

<TITLE>CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sugar imports subject to the U.S.
sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial
week of the 1987 sugar quota year, totaled 5,988 short tons
versus 46,254 tons the previous week, the Agriculture
Department said.
    The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year

compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was

    The department said the Customs Service has reported that
weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight
basis and when final polarizations are received, cumulative
import data are adjusted accordingly.

<TITLE>BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 26 - Brazil's "Cruzado" anti- </DATELINE><BODY>inflation
plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
pct inflation rate.
    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
economist said.
    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
foreign debt.
    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
under 150 mln.

<TITLE>U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought."
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth."

<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said
prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.
    It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired
in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six
months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year
period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln
dlrs.
    The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of
the fiscal year, AM said.
    AM International said its old division are expected to
benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline
in the value of the dollar.
    "Research, development and engineering expenditures in
fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company
said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital
expenditures.
    Earlier AM reported a fourth quarter operating loss of two
cts a share compared to profits of seven cts a share a year
ago. Revenues rose to 291.8 mln dlrs from 151.1 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina could suspend payments on
its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr
loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party
Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.
    "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the
negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth
of the country," he added.
    Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New
York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks,
told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the
banks were divided on the loan request.
    Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day
of talks had been postponed.
    He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of
Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest
payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was
to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in
1987, Baglini said.
    "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own
pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest
payments," he added.

<TITLE>KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die."
    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated."
    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose."

<TITLE>CANADA'S WILSON SEEKS TEMPORARY BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson
said he will use temporary authority under the Financial
Administration act to borrow an additional 600 mln dlrs in next
Thursday's treasury bill auction.
    In a statement, Wilson said the action would permit the
government to proceed with its debt program during a period
when there was not sufficient borrowing authority, which is
granted by Parliament, to cover the government's needs.
    Ottawa announced previously it was seeking Parliamentary
approval for the additional authority to cover the financing of
an increase in the government's foreign reserves.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>QUEBECOR &lt;PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Arraf, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest
publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new
daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president
Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.
    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec
government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue
Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper
mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.
    "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This
is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he
plans to announce a decision early next week.
    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last
year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily
newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the
second-largest circulation paper in Canada.
    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-
language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city
the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North
America, analysts have said.
    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English
language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six
months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new
venture would have the support of major advertisers.
    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55
pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of
two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project
but has not decided whether he would take partners in the
newspaper venture.
    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one
of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.
    "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the
short term," Peladeau said.
    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L>
does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.
    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake
in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the
govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British
printing acquiring the other 49 pct.
    "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of
newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to
print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to
myself...next time we'll be ready."
    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint
capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.
    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year
and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror
newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.
    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49
pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's
540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will
have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build
another mill to meet their demands .
    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or
other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be
on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed
area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the
government.
    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures
with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in
France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large
printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.
    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would
provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are
prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would
consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in
France or the U.S.
    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of
about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of
two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating
the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,
Peladeau said.
    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers
in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the
province.
    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its
listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock
Exchange listing.

<TITLE>IRAN ANNOUNCES END OF MAJOR OFFENSIVE IN GULF WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran announced tonight that its major
offensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing
savage blows against the Baghdad government.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in
London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into
Iraq on January 9 was now over.
    It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and
Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had
"dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the
history of the Iraq-imposed war."
    The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to
herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in
southern Iraq.
    "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad
government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance
power of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA.
    It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive
and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and
discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in
Iraq.
    Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of
enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken
over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into
Basra.
    The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the
statement said.
    It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally
destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The
victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti-
aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and
the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been "acting a bit
strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very
profitable securities firm."
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization," said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way," he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company," he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

<TITLE>COLECO INDUSTRIES &lt;CLC> SEES PROFIT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST HARTFORD, Conn., FEb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coleco Industries Inc said
it expects to return to profitability in 1987.
    Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for
the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln
dlrs in the year earlier.
    In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic
swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep
decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln
dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.
    Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a
more diversified organization through four major acquisitions
last year.
    Products from the new acquisitions and other new product
introductions are expected to enable it to return to
profitability, it said.
    At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president
Morton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts
a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.

<TITLE>GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study on grain certificates due out
shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
told Reuters.
    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
senate agriculture committee.
    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire
against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.
    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,
while USDA remains firmly committed to it.

<TITLE>Venezuela seeks 'flexibility' from banks-azpurua</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Caracas, feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela is seeking a 'constructive and
flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to
reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister
manuel azpurua told a press conference.
    He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york
between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's
13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they are
progressing."
    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's
decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate
according to its own interest.
    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors
today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over
libor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."
    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to
venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last
february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct
Venezuela wants.
    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with
the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments
due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment
schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.
    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in
public and private debt principal this year. It was due to
amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420
mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.
    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no
principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting
that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank
loans.
    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to
lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that
no direct commitment was likely on new loans.
    "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and
there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of
financing is guaranteed," azpurua said.
    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan
proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt
payments, "because circumstances change too quickly."
    At the same time, he said the government is presently
studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private
sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.
The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the
central bank.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thomson McKinnon Mortgage Assets Corp, a
unit of Thomson McKinnon Inc, is offering 100 mln dlrs of
collateralized mortgage obligations in three tranches that
include floating rate and inverse floating rate CMOS.
    The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an
initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis
points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon.
    The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs. It has an average
life of 13.49 years and matures 2018. These CMOs were given an
initial coupon of 11-1/2 pct and priced at 104.40.
    Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2
pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct).
    A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse
floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The
yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said.
    The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were
assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor's and secured
by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, Freddie Mac, certificates.

<TITLE>OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cenergy Corp reported fourth quarter net
income of 790,000 dlrs or seven cts per share on revenues of
7.7 mln dlrs.
    For the year it reported a net loss of 6.5 mln dlrs or 70
cts per share as a result of writedowns in the book value of
its oil and gas properties in the first two quarters. Revenues
were 37 mln dlrs.
    Following the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1985,
it changed to a calender year end.
    For the nine months ended Dec 31, 1985, it reported a loss
of 63.4 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs per share on revenues of 47.6 mln
dlrs, which it said was a result of noncash writedowns of oil
and gas properties.
    For the year ended March 31, 1985, Cenergy reported net
income of 3,705,000 dlrs or 36 cts per share on revenues of 71
mln dlrs.
    The company said its reserves during the year fell to five
mln barrels from 6.4 mln barrels of oil and to 60.1 bilion
cubic feet of gas from 63.7 BCF. It said these reserves did not
disappear but are available to produce as prices recover.

<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nova, the Canadian company that
owns 56 pct of Husky Oil Ltd, said it received government
approval for a transaction under which &lt;Union Faith Canada
Holding Ltd> would buy a 43 pct stake in Husky.
    Nova said the Minister of Regional and Industrial
Expansion, Michel Cote, ruled that Union Faith's purchase of
the Husky stake would not result in Husky ceding control to a
non-Canadian company. It said this ruling was a key condition
in completing the deal.
    Union Faith is equally owned by &lt;Hutchison Whampoa Ltd> and
&lt;Hong Kong Electric Holdings Ltd>.
    Under the agreement with Union Faith, Husky will become a
private company with Union Faith and Nova each holding 43 pct
of its stock.
    Nine pct of Husky would be owned by relatives of Li
Ka-Shing, chairman of Hutchison, and five pct by the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerice.

(FDIC) said three troubled banks in Texas and Louisiana were
merged with healthy financial institutions.
    The FDIC said it subsidized the merger of Central Bank and

that Central was in danger of failing.
    Central had assets of 28.3 mln dlrs.

Bank, Hart, Tex., were assumed by Hale County State Bank,
Plainview, Tex.
    Farmers, with 9.6 mln dlrs in assets, was closed by Texas
bank regulators.
    The deposits of the failed First National Bank of Crosby,
Crosby, Tex., with total assets of 8.2 mln dlrs, were assumed
by Central Bancshares of the South Inc, Birmingham, Ala., after
First National was closed by federal bank regulators, the FDIC
said.
    The number of federally insured banks to fail so far this
year now totals 32, the FDIC said.

<TITLE>BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.
    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon
what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an
initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina
has threatened to emulate Brazil's payments moratorium if the
banks do not grant its request.

<TITLE>LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY NAILENE CHOU WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Liquefied natural gas imports from
Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
    "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
profitably even in the current price environment,"  Frank
Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
higher by the end of 1987.
    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
    Company sources also said that any negotiations with
Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market
values.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,
before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.
    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when
Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.
    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of
the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.
    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.
    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent
Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    "A significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses," Beesley said.
    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington
said.
    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without Congressional legislation.

<TITLE>REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sue Baker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission's scathing   
comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald
Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last November.
    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they
opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.
    "Their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president," the report said after a three-month probe.
    "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages."
    The report saved some of its most scathing language for
Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal
friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House
angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.
    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser," said
the report.
    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower
Commission's findings next week.
    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not
be the only White House official to leave in the near future.

<TITLE>SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland's economy, combining low
unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, OECD, said.
    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
said.
    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
nation OECD area.
    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
respectively in 1986.
    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
would shrink in both years.
    But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
improving international balances," the OECD said.
    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
years of relative weakness, it noted.
    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
GDP, it added.
    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
after vigorous growth in 1986.
    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
earners of foreign exchange.
    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
    Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in
international financial markets give rise to the question
whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said.

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
officials said.
    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"
an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."
    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
Moscow, it could take several months.
    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.
    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"
said one former USDA official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
China wheat under the subsidy program.
    An official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviets.
    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,
basic, factual economics."
    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal
suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
from the Iran arms affair.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said it was willing
to participate with several other industrial countries in
providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.
    The Treasury announcecement did not name the other
countries nor the amount of financing the United States was
willing to supply.
    Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday
night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15
billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.
    "Our willingness to participate in this multilateral
short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's
economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable
balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.
    In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine
officials said the country needed "a more serene climate" to
carry out structural changes in the economy.
    But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its
foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.
    The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for
Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.
    The one-page statement noted the International Monetary
Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and
prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for
it on February 18.
    "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF
balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to
repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation
of its economic program," the statement said.
    The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less
than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze
to restrain inflation.
    The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine
Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for
several days.
    Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower
interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign
debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of
the money is loaned in Argentina.

<TITLE>BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.
    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon
what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an
initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina
has threatened to follow Brazil in declaring a payments
moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.

<TITLE>JURY FINDS FOR DOW &lt;DOW> IN BIRTH DEFECT CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dow Chemical Co's &lt;DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to
corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the
conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA
Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had
indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two
dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987
program this month.
    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the
department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who
enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.
    "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to
demands that would follow from other commodity groups.

<TITLE>AGENCY VOTES TO END LOCAL NUCLEAR PLANT VETO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,
which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial
plants in New York and New Hampshire.
    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public
comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation
standards of its own.
    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,
N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in
evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.
    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe
evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full
power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.
    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan
on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting
the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.
    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had
not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.
    In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission
said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in
cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency
evacuation planning.

grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the
government that they had done so probably will be allowed to
continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program
benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program
benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to
the acreage base for that crop.
    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that
farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown
oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt
oats production or lose corn program benefits.
    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats
but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.

National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush
trader said.
    "But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

<TITLE>FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to
today."
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."
    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."
    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."

here today in NASA's first successful launch of the year.
    The 116-foot (35.4-meter) Delta -- a reliable workhorse of

    The launch came after two delays in two days. The first
postponement was caused by fuel leak and the second by
high-speed crosswinds that NASA officials say could have torn
the rocket apart during fiery ascent.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO TRY TO OPEN MARKET TO U.S. CAR PARTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has pledged to try to increase
its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to
monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.
    U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese
officials to try to force open the Japanese market to
American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five
billion dlr deficit in car parts trade.
    Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made
parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts
for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.
    He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try
to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to
monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.
    The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that
"statistics support the perception in the United States that
American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner
circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional
suppliers."
    It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five
billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S.
firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market.

<TITLE>FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's right wing government is facing
growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
forecasts for this year.
    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
september.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
elections due by April 1988.
    "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"
said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have the
impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
this year."
    "The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
moderation will be maintained," he added.
    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
justified by increased productivity.
    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
prices.
    Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," he
also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
government would spend two billion francs on a series of
measures to boost employment and training
    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
its top priority.
    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
    "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
government and I dont think this administration is going to
reverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist at
recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
said.
    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
    "But that would still be an exceptional achievement
considering that for the first time since the Second World War
all french prices have been freed," he commented.
    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
costs.
    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
as the government kept wages under control.
    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
he added.
    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
deficit, several analysts said.
    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
expected growth, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unadjusted consumer price index
(base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to 99.7 in January from the previous
month, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
    The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.
    The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1
pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct
in September 1958.
    Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell
for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall
decline for the month.
    Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January
compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities,
gasoline and vegetables fell.
    The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area
(base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month
earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing
and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down
0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.

<TITLE>JAPAN MARCH BOND COUPON SEEN UNCHANGED AT FIVE PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has proposed
informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon
on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from
February at five pct, underwriting sources said.
    They said the ministry wants a 0.50 yen raise in issue
price from February to 99.50 to yield a record low 5.075 pct.
    The 5.151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record
low. The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the
600 billion in February.
    The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed
terms immediately, the sources said.

<TITLE>U.S. LAUNCHES WEATHER SATELLITE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>An unmanned Delta rocket
carrying a 57 mln dlr weather observation satellite blasted off
here today in the first U.S. Space launch of the year.
    The 116-foot rocket lifted off at 1805 local time (2305
GMT) and placed in orbit a 1,850 pound Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to replace an
identical one that was destroyed last May when a Delta rocket
exploded after liftoff.
    Weather forecasters have had only a single satellite to
cover the entire U.S. Since another GOES failed in orbit in
August 1984.
    "We'll have both our weather eyes open again," said Thomas
Pyke, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which owns and operates the satellite.
    The smooth launching came after two delays in as many days.
The first was caused by a fuel leak and the second by powerful
crosswinds.
    The Delta was the first of six rockets scheduled for launch
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration this year.
The launch marked the third straight success for the space
program which was battered by a series of failures in 1986,
including the loss of the Challenger shuttle.

<TITLE>ITALIAN COALITION MEETS AS GOVERNMENT CRISIS LOOMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaders of Italy's five coalition parties
have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences
which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's
Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats.
    Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said
Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week,
allowing negotiations on a new government leader.
    The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting
after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last
August, under which he was to hand over the prime minister's
job next month, was unlikely to be fulfilled.
    Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely
to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social
Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister's
job. They said Craxi's plans to resign show he has decided to
stick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program
and sharing of ministries will not be easy.
    They said there is dissent among the partners and that
Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said
the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether
formation of a new government is feasible or early elections
are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988.

<TITLE>N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monetary and credit growth rates in
New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels
following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late
last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.
    The monetary and credit growth figures for the December
quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high
growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short
term money market, Russell said in a statement.
    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs
of the recent expansion became apparent in September and
October last year, Russell said.
    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of
17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in
the year ended September.
    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was
30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.
    "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,
including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting
differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading
banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese life insurers, trust banks and
corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond
market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the
U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.
    After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,
Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on
similar types of investments, they said.
    Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may
double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in
1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.
    Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and
strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began
poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,
but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases
suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each
of the previous five months.
    Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.
    This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw
the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct
of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.
    "The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first
because of its size and next because it has been successful
over the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managing
director of Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,
enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in
and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.
    However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.
They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.
    Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which
concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover
payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.
Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,
manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed
income activities.
    There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term
investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a
significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the
liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.
    Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.
Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.
Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.
    Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports
of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations,
he added.
    Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance
Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which
are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign
securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and
intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.
    Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their
funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West
Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.
    Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks
relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the
strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to
offset currency risks, he added.
    One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct
annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in
U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund
investment stategies.
    The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European
bonds, he said.
    Japanese investments in British equities have already
turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew
Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at
County Securities Japan.
    "Last week was the busiest week we had," he said.
    Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of
British companies and the recent deregulation of government
controlled firms, fund managers said.
    Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese
interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by
worries about the French franc, they said.
    Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and
speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term
political stability, they added.
    Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany,
particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts,
are concerned about the recent dollar fall.
    Australia also poses some risks due to currency values,
they added.

    A bank official told Reuters the increase came mainly from
increased local obu borrowings from their Asian counterparts.
    He said the assets, held by 15 foreign and local banks,
were mainly in U.S. Dollars with the remainder in certificates
of deposit and bonds. About 90 pct of the assets came from Asia
and the rest from North America and Europe, he added.

<TITLE>JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Domestic demand is now expected to make
no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal
1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all
of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.
    However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic
Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise
in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.
    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this
financial year and net export growth will provide the total
source of gdp growth.
    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would
contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5
pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.
    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic
parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a
slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit
than first anticipated.
    "The government initially forecast a current account deficit
for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that
the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.
    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC
in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is
broadly on track, Keating said.
    "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more
sluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.
    "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more
than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth
in domestic production and employment."
    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation
rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.
    "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in
inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary
effects wane," he said.
    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick
up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in
net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from
private domestic demand.
    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a
strengthening in real household disposable income.
    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year
should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level
broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.
    "The current account deficit will continue to show
improvement in 1987/88," Keating said.
    "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent
years recede further, and given continued effective wage
restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," he
said.

<TITLE>MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will offer its commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative
to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the
alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt
rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing."
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country"s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt
certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in
selected industries under the Philippines" debt/equity program.
    Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of
5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to
Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received."
    "We don"t believe that there is going to be a problem on the
accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative
proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government
regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

<TITLE>PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks on the possibility of reintroducing
global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with
sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was
not included in a key negotiating forum.
    The special meeting of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a
prolonged slide in coffee prices.
    However, delegates said no solution to the question of how
to implement quotas was yet in sight.
    World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to
regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement
-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to
a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.
    Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.
    Producers and consumers now are facing off over the
question of how quotas should be calculated under any future
quota distribution scheme, delegates said.
    Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight
producing countries was not represented in a contact group of
five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which
was set up to facilitate debate.
    The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court
and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of
Costa Rica said.
    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas
April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota
shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before
September 30, delegates said.
    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil
to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export
market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia
six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
    But consuming countries and the dissident producer group
have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined
by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable
production and stocks statistics.
    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and
Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota
distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal
that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.
    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on
a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even
adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.
    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the
supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a
result, industry sources said.
    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about
steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an
upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,
they said.

<TITLE>BRITISH CONSERVATIVES AHEAD OF LABOUR IN NEW POLLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain"s ruling Conservatives have
enlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party, according
to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday.
    A Market &amp; Opinion Research International (MORI) poll
conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a
six point lead, while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for
The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead.
    The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the
Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in
a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of
Greenwich, near London.
    The MORI poll, conducted in the six days leading up to the
by-election, showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote,
Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and
Liberals with 21 pct.
    The Sunday Express said its poll, conducted on Friday,
found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote, Labour
with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct.
    A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last
Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over
Labour. In that survey, the Conservatives had the support of 39
pct of the voters, Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
1987.
    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
a drawdown on stocks.
    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
gain," the report says.
    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
and palm kernels."
    Constraints to significant overall increases in
agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
report underlines.
    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
largely offset gains in yields.
    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
resistant rice types.
    The government is depending on increased production of
export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
oil prices.
    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
report says.
    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
in domestic demand.
    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
in 1984.
    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
for the slump.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks
published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked
for such a meeting."
    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister
said.
    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.
    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international
oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."
    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
April at the request of certain of the body"s members.
    Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.
    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We
expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
April." But he expected the situation would later improve.

<TITLE>INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."
    "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"
the report says.
    Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s," the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry."
    "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture," the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

<TITLE>INDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opposition politicians, businessmen
and newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget
and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees.
    They said the budget failed to provide incentives for
economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform.
    But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise
in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where
playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a
vote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest selling
paper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier."
    The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelessly
political." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is bad
for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and
neutral in respect of everything else."
    Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done
little for them.
    Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and
education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current
expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He
told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of
money-losing public sector industries.
    Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but
otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation
policy launched two years ago.
    Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generally
unfavourable.
    Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals
for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost
industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real
economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the
1985-90 development plan.
    Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers
of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital
market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove
surtax on corporate income.
    Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fell
in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"s
proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities
industry.
    The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and
trading was suspended several times.
    Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in
capital gains tax on stock sales.
    Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of
three years without incurring capital gains tax.
    Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the
fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were
taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come.

<TITLE>MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will offer its commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative
to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the
alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt
rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing."
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the
debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in
selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program.
    Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of
5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to
Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received."
    "We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the
accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative
proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government
regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi riyal interbank deposits were
steady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market.
    Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions
amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting
the current decline in oil prices.
    Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab
producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC
prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency
meeting of the 13-member organisation.
    A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European
weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.
    Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct
after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday.
    One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at
6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively.
    The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the
dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday.

<TITLE>QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DOHA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs
regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf money markets have grown reasonably
well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain
to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf
International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.
    The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf
capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional
investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank
accounts and precious metals.
    "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with
more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the
disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.
    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three
categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.
    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of
short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had
floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.
    "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large
extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.
    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans
and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of
stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock
exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish
exchanges.
    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,
governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital
markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.
    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had
"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital
markets in the region."
    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,
financial awareness among investors is still lacking and
investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack
depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted
investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.
    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some
Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt
financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.
    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation
of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.
    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made
available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been
taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to
own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.
    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth
from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and
the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi
Arabia.
    But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal
denominated bond issued in 1978.
    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading
in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal
exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,
Azzam said.

<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the
... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance."
    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market."
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.
    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
pricing agreement.
    "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.
    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Coffee Organization
(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued
with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but
delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and
consumers were diminishing by the minute.
    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in
coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without
agreement, delegates said.
    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within
the next six weeks or in September, they said.
    The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became
apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the
formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates
said.
    Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices
soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by
nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee
producer and exporter.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Economy continued to expand in
February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    But production remained vigorous, with more than three
times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually
resumed production.
    The same number of members reported inventories were higher
as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened
since August 1984.
    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying
higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine
to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

    It said wheat stocks at the end of 1986 were 390,000
tonnes, up from 223,000 at end-1985. It forecast end-1987
stocks at around 290,000 tonnes.
    The main suppliers in 1986 were Australia (44 pct), the
U.S. (29 pct), Canada (12 pct), Argentina (8 pct) and Saudi
Arabia (5 pct).

<TITLE>ZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange
auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since
January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.
    "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been
abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.
    He said the system would be reintroduced after current
talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.
    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction
system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private
bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.
    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the
government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.
    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and
strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible
for the government and the private sector, he said.
    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The
kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.
In January 1987 the government was more than two months in
arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and
the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange
rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the
country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete, open and
frank, a senior Polish banker was quoted as saying.
    Wladyslaw Baka, head of Poland's National Bank, told the
official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step
towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.
    "Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the
talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of
understanding for Poland's difficult economic position," PAP
quoted Baka as saying.
    Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial
obligations to the U.S., "but not in a short time, and not
without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a
cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."
    Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June, after a 36-year
absence, IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on
fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. A major
report is expected to be issued in Washington soon.
    Poland has said it will not be able to meet interest
repayments and debt principle falling due this year.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's raw sugar output is likely
to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and
below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.
Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.
    Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world
markets in late 1986, the report said.
    The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar
production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of
1.99 mln.
    It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency
in 1984 may have been short-lived.
    The report said, "The government continues to promote
sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification
program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane
producers.
    "However, there are considerable indications that farmers
are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not
as good as that of other crops."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts
in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests
by European farmers, Community officials said.
    The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's
Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has
called for radical changes in the price support system.
    EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food
surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners
and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such
action.
    With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes
of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge
stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days
of open-ended price guarantees must end.
    EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices
paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the
new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC
members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline.
    Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled
with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead
to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products.
    A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed
guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be
scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases.
    The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on
agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow
two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European
currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected
shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.
    The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils
and fats tax and a change in the "green" exchange rate system,
which translates EC farm prices into national currencies.
    The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on
imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger
a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides
the EC with the bulk of its soybeans.
    It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat
products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter
consumption.
    West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which
would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with
weak and strong currencies were brought more into line.

<TITLE>QANTAS TO BUY FOUR 747-400'S FOR ONE BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firm
order with Boeing Co &lt;BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost
of 250 mln Australian dlrs each, chairman Jim Leslie said.
    The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others
arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a
statement.
    The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747
family, he said.
    The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet
to 28, he said.
    Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who
are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will
announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.
    He said they are United Technologies Corp &lt;UTX> unit &lt;Pratt^M
and Whitney>, General Electric Co &lt;GE> and Britain's &lt;Rolls-Royce^M
 Ltd>.
    He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such
as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced
electronics, should have its first flight next February. The
400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms
further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said.
    The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and
foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay
for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.
    The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up
from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel
saving, he said.
    The higher range and payload means they will first be used
on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.
    They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney
and Los Angeles.

    Analysts said there was speculation that American Express
would sell a stake of Shearson to a Japanese firm and also that
20 pct of the profitable brokerage would be sold to the public.
Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express's 1.25
billion dlrs net in 1986.
    American Express remained silent last Thursday and Friday
as rumours drove its stock up a total of 5.50 dlrs in two days.
It closed Friday at 74.

<TITLE>INDONESIA UNLIKELY TO IMPORT PHILIPPINES COPRA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia is unlikely to import copra
from the Philippines in 1987 after importing 30,000 tonnes in
1986, the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said.
    The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesian
rupiah, an increase in import duties on copra and increases in
the price of Philippines copra have reduced the margin between
prices in the two countries.
    Indonesia's copra production is forecast at 1.32 mln tonnes
in calendar 1987, up from 1.30 mln tonnes in 1986.

<TITLE>STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the
Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand
and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas,
officials and seismologists said.
    There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake
jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas.
    The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually
isolated.
    A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which
has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges
in the area had been damaged.
    No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to
hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud
slip.
    Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes,
the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were
followed by a series of aftershocks.
    The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato
regions in the northeast of the North Island.
    Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more
than a week.
    Police said many districts lost power supplies and
telephone links.
    Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water
behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above
Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the
roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina, the
largest earth dam in the North Island.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES HEADS CONFIDENTLY INTO DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin
starts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory
committee in New York tomorrow, buoyed by an economy on the
mend and political stability one year after President Corazon
Aquino took power, central bank officials said.
    The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion
dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between
January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on
another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any
new agreement, the officials said.
    Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage
point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and
Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR
portend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repayment
suspension last week, the officials said.
    Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since
1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16
percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a
77 billion dlr rescue.
    Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is
currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.
    The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered
when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7.
    Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional
5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments.
    One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type
accord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing
to endorse five months after it was signed.
    In Manila's case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs
outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks
on the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks have
average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.

<TITLE>SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi crude oil output last month fell
to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in January, Gulf oil sources said.
    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    The production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
entitlements before the month-end.
    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
    The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
&lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
refineries.
    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
at around 200,000 bpd each.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN PALM OIL OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's palm oil output is expected
to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its
annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector.
    The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output
is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in
1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln
in 1985.
    The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a
provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.
    A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln
tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.
    "More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will
be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes," the report said.
    The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export
tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher
international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase
in exports this year.
    Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against
695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
    The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
produced in 1985/86.
    In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
    The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of
quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
    Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
    Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
    The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
    The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
Indonesian cocoa beans.
    The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
(crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
CTC processing plants.
    Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
    Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
123,000 tonnes in 1986.
    Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
    The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality
controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more
competititve in the world market.

<TITLE>SINGAPORE EXCHANGE SEEKING NASDAQ/LONDON LINK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)
plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation System, banking sources said.
    The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York
authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was
very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end
of this month.
    Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters
they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems
on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local
financial support for the plan existed.
    Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the
three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling
a gap when no trading takes place.
    A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start
of three-centre trading to determine investor interest.
    The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed
in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and
transfer information among the different time zones, but some
details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank
director said.
    Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy
sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market
liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.
    But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head
start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong,
Toyko and Australia, he said.
    On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ),
modelled on NASDAQ.
    At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one
company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd
(SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small
firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.
    Market sources expect the next few companies listed will
also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem
meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of
Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said.
    SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek
Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr
each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times.
    In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial
1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far
more than 900,000 shares have traded.

<TITLE>GERMAN EUROBOND MARKET EXPECTS BREATHING SPACE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>After an onslaught of new paper, fewer
mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.
    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume
for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.
    "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said.
    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,
including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.
Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,
from 3.6 billion in January.
    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very
best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.
    "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you
can give a good coupon," another manager said.
    But even some government borrowers were not getting the
best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more
readily under other conditions.
    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,
bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees
on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.
    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday
at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2
pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.
    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees
at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.
    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the
10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for
Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks
mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.
    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last
two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain
about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which
they say is too inflexible.
    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be
registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the
two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on
the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the
next calendar period to schedule the bond again.
    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.
    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks
from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be
completely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would give
that up," one banking analyst said.
    "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"
the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the
volume of new issues themselves.
    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar
without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the
registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through
the euromarket, he said.
    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank
sacrificing its present calendar system.
    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication
departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to
the carnival holiday.
    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.
In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.

<TITLE>JAPAN'S NTT FORECASTS PROFITS FALL IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>
(NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, 1988 from a projected 348 billion this
year, the company said.
    Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to
5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTT
said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry.
    NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770
billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research and
development, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year.
    An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new
entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a
sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January, were the
major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.
    The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in
1985.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai Airways International plans to
expand its fleet to 58 from 30 aircraft by 1995, company
officials said.
    Thamnoon Wanglee, vice-president for finance, told a
weekend marketing conference Thai would finance the expansion
by borrowing, but he did not give details.
    He said the airline planned to reduce its yen borrowing to
36.4 pct of overall debt by September 1992. It is currently
64.3 pct of overall debt.
    He said dollar borrowing should rise to 56.2 pct of overall
debt in the same period, compared to 15.7 pct now.
    Other company officials said the state-owned airline had no
plans to go private. They said the airline is studying a
government proposal for it to merge with Thai Airways Company,
the state-owned domestic carrier.
    A report presented to the conference showed the airline
expects passenger sales revenue to be 13 pct higher in 1987
than in 1986. This follows a 20 pct jump in passenger sales
revenue in the past four months.
    Executive vice president Chatrachai Bunya-ananta said the
current expansion of Bangkok airport would be completed this
year.

<TITLE>IRAQ DEFERS PAYMENTS ON 500 MLN DLR EUROLOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq has secured agreement to defer
outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan
following five months of negotiations with creditor banks.
    Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's
continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its
economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world
oil prices.
    Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last
September it could not meet the remaining four principal
repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first of
these for 71.25 mln due on September 29.
    The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management of
Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has a
five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over
London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some
way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the
first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not
deferred.
    One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of
the accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in three
more instalments to be made every six months.
    The remaining three principal instalments - originally due
in March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be
deferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said.
    The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty
interest is being imposed, the sources added.
    Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one
of resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative for
Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign
debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought
to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies,
particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
    The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned
Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr
deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in
October, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period.
    The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its
allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing.
    But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of
credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and
western government export credit agencies has been underway.
Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of
obligations due on letters of credit.

<TITLE>JAPAN PLANS MORE FLEXIBLE CORPORATE BOND ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses will issue new
corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back
to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.
    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.
    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition
among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    Market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.
    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.
    The cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange
Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system
would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in
1988, the sources said.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUYS SOME 95,000 TONNES SOYBEANS FROM CHINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese importers bought some 95,000
tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September
shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources
said.
    The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs
from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down
from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.
    Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices
in Chicago plus the FOB premium.
    Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot
buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986
crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some
300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.
    Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to
remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the
sources said.
    In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese
edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,
but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of
Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

<TITLE>TRADING DELAYED ON SINGAPORE'S NEW BILL MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The start of trading on the new
Singapore Government Securities Market has been postponed until
late March or early April because legislative amendments still
need parliamentary approval, banking sources said.
    The new bill market, intended to establish a base for a
wider capital market and to encourage private bond issues in
Singapore, was supposed to be launched today.
    William K.K. Wong, managing director of Indosuez Asia
(Singapore) Ltd, said there is no real obstacle to prevent the
new market from taking off. Most dealers are optimistic it will
provide more liquidity for operators to trade, he said.
    Lawrence Yeo, director of Citicorp Investment Bank
(Singapore) Ltd, said the market's success depends on domestic
participation.
    The five primary dealers and the three registered dealers
will all be local companies.
    The primary dealers are &lt;Commercial Discount Co Ltd>,
&lt;National Discount Co Ltd>, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd
&lt;OCBM.SI>, &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd> and United Overseas Bank
Ltd &lt;UOBM.SI>. They will underwrite the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) auctions, maintain market liquidity and channel
open-market operations, MAS said.
    &lt;Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd>, &lt;Indosuez Asia
(Singapore) Ltd> and &lt;Credit Suisse First Boston Asia Ltd> will
be recognised as registered dealers. They will act as market
makers but will not bid directly at auctions.
    MAS plans to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments
grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38
billion dlrs of paper over the first five years.
    Non-competitive bids from primary dealers prepared to
accept average yield will be allocated first, to a maximum
500,000 dlrs for notes and bonds and to an unlimited amount for
treasury bills.
    The remaining amount will be awarded to competitive bidders
from the lowest yield upwards.
    In the secondary market, the standard lot traded between
dealers will be one mln dlrs worth of treasury bills and
500,000 dlrs worth of government notes and bonds.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
companies at the core of their business empire.
    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
&lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
&lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
any raid on the heart of their business empire.
    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
interests to protect its core activities.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soybean imports are forecast to rise to
425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated
300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy
said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.
    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of
self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it
did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because
yields have remained below target.
    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000
tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000
tonnes in 1985/86.
    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to
1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and
890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.
    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to
rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to
come on stream in early 1988.
    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the
U.S. Provides the rest, it said.
    "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since
domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are
willing to pay a premium for them," it said.
    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both
1986/87 and 1987/88.
    "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient
supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"
the report said.

    The offer capitalises IC Gas at around one billion stg.
    It said it was tendering for both ordinary stock and loan

<TITLE>JAPANESE BANKS COOL ON NIGERIAN DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese banks are expected to give
Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here
tomorrow for talks, banking sources said.
    "We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt
rescheduling," said a senior official at a leading Japanese
bank.
    A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese
creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support
for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr
foreign debt, bankers said.
    The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank
creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria
although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept
rescheduling of part of their existing loans.
    "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese
creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the
nation's debt situation," said another Japanese bank official.
    He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent
of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were
uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.
    Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria,
representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western
commercial institutions, banking sources said.
    They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs
in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5
billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese
banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as
well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day
meeting here, the sources added.
    "Otherwise, our response will be very negative," the senior
official said.
    Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor
banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt
proposal.
    Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial
banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems.
    Barclays Bank plc &lt;BCS.L> has the most exposure to
Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee
looking at the problem, the banking sources said. BankAmerica
Corp &lt;BAC.N> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far
East and representing them on the committee, they added.

    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 1.61 billion stg.
    Partly offsetting this outflow, exchequer transactions and
a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360
mln stg respectively. In addition, bankers' balances above
target will add some 20 mln stg to the system today.

<TITLE>JAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely
to leave office this summer amid opposition to his
controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.
    They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has
suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct
sales tax planned for January 1988.
    "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the
end of his administration, which is not only impossible but
also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori,
professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.
    "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as
parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,"
Shiratori said.
    Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of
parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is
needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.
    Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP
members who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objecting
because of their constituencies," he told a meeting of
government and party leaders. "If the party discipline is
broken, I would like to see punishment considered."
    "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly
because Nakasone breached his election pledge against
introducing it," Shiratori said.
    "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels
uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's
appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is
rapidly aging," he said.
    Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect
the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April,
involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and
assemblies at all levels.
    But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties
excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with
the LDP, the political analysts added.
    Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of the
sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for
some time before the government makes a final decision.
    "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to
perhaps three pct.
    "A third alternative for the government is to ram through
the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said.
    Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University,
thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alone
will take a vote on the tax bills," he said.
    The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and
143 in the 252-seat Upper House.
    To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP
pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to
resign, Sato said.
    "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to
return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said.

<TITLE>BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOWETO, South Africa, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thousands of black
mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize
control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal
mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant
black workers.
    About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves
proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).
    They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the
end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations.
    Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more
than half of the labour force in the mines.
    It was not stated how the union would "seize control."
    The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of
single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by
housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.
    The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since
South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also
shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with
anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front
(UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their
support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela be released.

    It said the quota allocation was based on a national

from 3.05 mln in mid-January.

<TITLE>ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rajan Moses, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mine and industry officials from
most member states of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group
exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according
to views polled by Reuter correspondents.
    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at
cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and
boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.
    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account
for some 65 pct of the world's tin output.
    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export
quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,
Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.
    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.
However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly
equal to its expected output this year.
    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.
    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,
said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that
output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started
March 1.
    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that
excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in
the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.
    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb
and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More
than 100 applications for licences are pending.
    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining
licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed
that local mines were not overproducing.
    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister
Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.
    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT
Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to
stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was
close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.
    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said
Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this
would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.
    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin
exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage
bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be
permitted, he said.
    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to
disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive
production, industry sources said.
    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told
Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,
Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.
    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in
1985, Pramual said.
    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than
its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.
    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz
that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in
calendar 1987.
    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of
October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state
mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of
Bolivia's total exports.
    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports
but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be
achieved. He did not elaborate.
    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in
Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its
ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had
declined due to poor demand and high production costs.
    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was
less than 1,000 tonnes last year.
    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'
export figures every three months using customs documents and
make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to
be breached within the year-long quota period.
    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to
breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.
    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil
their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other
members at the ATPC's discretion.
    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated
106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.
    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with
the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes
respectively during the quota period.

<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea plans to take steps to keep
its 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs,
Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
    Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead
of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and
investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from
rising too quickly.
    Last year South Korea's current account surplus was 4.65
billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484
mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln in
January 1986, Bank of Korea figures show.

<TITLE>SAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rosario Liquicia, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Disagreement over management of &lt;San
Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's
appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investment
analysts said.
    They told Reuters the presence of &lt;United Coconut Planters
Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean
changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by
the family of its president, Andres Soriano.
    Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls
51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned.
    The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds
six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln
sequestered shares.
    The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by
Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was
a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he
left the country after Marcos's fall.
    Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for
the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit.
    The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded
at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday's close.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday
that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the
objections of some directors associated with Soriano.
    "I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such," he
said.
    "I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where
you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has
assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a
contentious manner," Ongpin added.
    The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing
Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that
a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit
and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a
clear conflict.
    UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy's
appointment, petitioning the PCGG "so that the interests of the
owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected."
    Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a
right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers
who claim ownership of the disputed shares.
    The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would
probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to
resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government
officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual
election is scheduled for May.
    A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to
the PCGG to decide whom to appoint.
    One analyst said objections were understandable from the
family that founded the company 97 years ago.
    "It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano,"
he said.
    SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net
sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales
of 10.36 billion.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The combined profits of Japan's major
corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to
fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to
the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research
Institute of Economics said.
    The private research body also said in a statement that 437
of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year
against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.
    Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on
sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.
    Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries
to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten
their business outlook, the institute said.
    It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce
corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved
performance outlook.
    Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will
be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction
businesses, it said.
    The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates
of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.

<TITLE>INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal
1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit
will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the
country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty,
economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.
    The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is
56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of
a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.
    The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on
wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.
    Economists pointed out that the government itself had
expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87
economic survey report published last week.
    Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime
Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to
trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for
1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he
said.
    But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously.
They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an
initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees.
    Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific
measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices.
    Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as
reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may
cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by
15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of
1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86
period.
    Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects,
after bad weather last year, may strain prices further.
    Economists said the deficit would also cause the government
to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and
bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up
from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion.
    No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes,
which will discourage savings, economists said.
    Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union
Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to
around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency
notes to cover the deficit.
    Brokers said stock market investors have started selling
long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the
budget that reduces the holding period required to claim
exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three.
    Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, "There is uncertainty
in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure."
    But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic
selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the
scene. "Just now there is acute nervousness in the market," he
said.
    Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help
small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the
capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market
on a long-term basis.
    New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and
non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion
rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion
in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan decided at a policy
board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation
by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money
market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.
    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank
said.
    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen
from 300 mln.
    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the
bank said.
    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less
will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD
rates.
    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln
yen from 30 mln.
    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by
0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut
in the official discount rate on February 23.
    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at
banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,
respectively.
    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said the broad
measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally
adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December.
    The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1
pct in the year to December.
    The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a
seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a
non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said.
    The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two
weks ago.
    In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and
by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year.
    The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a
non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also
confirmed provisional figures issued in February.
    The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct
in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the
Bank said.
    The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth
in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg.
    Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)
showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank
private sector's holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1
billion stg.
    There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in
January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing
sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest
bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.

<TITLE>EXCO BUYS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Mar 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of
British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, said it had
agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ Holdings
Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs.
    Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was
being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currently
holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.
    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct
each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.
    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the
largest U.S. Government securities brokers.
    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other
instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.
    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.
Government securities broker for the past four years and had
made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp
&lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.
    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be
bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net
income of around 16 mln dlrs.
    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of
brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.
    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in
the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which
provided computer software for the financial services
community.
    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market
turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a
day, and in London where it has 15 billion.
    It was also given permission last week to open an office in
Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about
five billion dlrs a day.
    The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of
B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Lewis, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary is to embark on a new series of
austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled
last year after quadrupling in 1985.
    The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by
Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.
    But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget
financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as
too high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed.
    "All the organizations of economic management have been
charged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said.
    Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "The
Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,
and of course the Fund would support these efforts."
    IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.
    Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state
budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last
year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.
    The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints
because of poor performance by state firms, which needed
subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.
    The exact extent and nature of savings are still under
discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest
budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.
    Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low
consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164
billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.
Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.
    "I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the
former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,"
Boesze said. "The central administration must be hard. ... If we
are not hard then we will not be successful."
    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve
provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and
800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. "I believe
these reserves should not be used at all," he said.
    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic
product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.
    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real
wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax
penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.
    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail
price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.
    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.
    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and
33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.
    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant
cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made
this difficult.
    But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to make
curtailments in subsidies in this area as well."
    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the
beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and
value added tax. The IMF supports these aims.
    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an
attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.
    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be
unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is
being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.
    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state
by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to
shed labour. He gave no exact figures.
    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible
for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped
the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.
    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single
budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved
for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).
    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to
more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven
billion in 1986, Boesze said.
    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year
to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while
trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more
than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years
earlier.
    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct
by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10
pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.
    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian
economists in a speech this month that the country's economy
was in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis.
    There would have to be a turnround with tangible results
this year, however, and borrowing must be used more
effectively.
    "Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,"
Berecz said.

<TITLE>DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
"Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Leach, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 2  - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's strong economic revival has led
some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some
quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian
experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.
    "I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian
miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always
oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and
unwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy's
leading economists and a professor at Rome University.
    According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have
been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute
seen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar and
the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,
    "I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be
the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign
newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another
story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark
room."
    Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists
here, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly the
dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial
enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.
     Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.,
&lt;FIAT.M> and &lt;ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the
major state industries are back in the black after years of
losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of
payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some
experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's
fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.
    Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it
feels to be its second-rate status among the major
industrialised countries.
    Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this
status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers
from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.
    Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an
agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada
attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned
managing the international monetary system.
    But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems
still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.
    "We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,"
warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti.
    He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed
cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on
the problems still remaining rather than those already solved.
    The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment
and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most
worrying problems, experts say.
    The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at
109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion
lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral
again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss
university in Rome.
    Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a
decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running
at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee
international competiveness, economists and industrialists say.
    And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last
October according to the latest official data.
    Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million
people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged
between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at
17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product
(GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct
in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to
check rising unemployment.
    Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw
materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.
    This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last
year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade
deficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billion
lire in 1985.
    But economists say the improvement owes little to any
structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal
of the trend in costs could have serious consequences.
    If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top
industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket
operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality
information about their activities, economists say.
    Italy has no controls on insider trading.
    The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements
controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to
be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less
blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating
procedures, economists say.
    "Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I
doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks
which would allow me to do that," says Spaventa.

<TITLE>JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
growing increasingly irritated with each other.
    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
    "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese
government official said. "But we are also frustrated."
    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
but it will, he said.
    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
remain when it talks with Congress.
    "It would only take five minutes to list their
accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.
    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
    On the following two days, the topics will range from
multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
problems as super computers.
    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
buying more imports.
    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one
Japanese official said.
    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
action by the U.S., Officials said.
    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
overhanging them.
    "We have no leverage," one official admitted.
    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
super computers.
    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
super computer market.
    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
public institutions like universities which buy the
sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
sellers, officials said.

    The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others
arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a
statement.
    The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747
family, he said.
    The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet
to 28, he said.
    Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who
are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will
announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.
    He said they are &lt;Pratt and Whitney> and General Electric
Co &lt;GE>, a unit of United Technologies Corp &lt;UTX>, and
Britain's &lt;Rolls-Royce Ltd>.
    He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such
as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced
electronics, should have its first flight next February. The
400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms
further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said.
    The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and
foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay
for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.
    The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up
from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel
saving, he said.
    The higher range and payload means they will first be used
on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.
    They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney
and Los Angeles.

<TITLE>EC OPENS ANTI-DUMPING ENQUIRY INTO SOVIET MERCURY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission said
it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union
is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.
    The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from
EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet
mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the
European industry.
    According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC
had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between
August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of
the EC market if they continue at the same pace.
    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than
40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to
cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The
imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.
    The Commission said the industry would probably be unable
to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would
result in loss of sales and jobs.
    The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the
Commission will allow all interested parties to state their
cases to the authority.

<TITLE>MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will offer commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash,
the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that
the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when
debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing."
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the
debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries
under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila
is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points
over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring
3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone
to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received."
    "We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on
the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this
alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the
government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

<TITLE>ARGENTINE DEBT NEGOTIATOR CONFIDENT OF ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's chief debt negotiator
said he was confident of a prompt accord with international
creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.
    "I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and
quick negotiation," Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on
return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world
financial officials.
    Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering
committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet
four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for
a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit.
    Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable, but
Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments
on its foreign debt.
    He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to
meet the targets, adding that the banks' attitude had improved
following Brazil's decision.
    The United States and a group of other industrial nations
on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan.
    Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Michel Camdessus.

<TITLE>MANILA OFFICIALS SPLIT OVER DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A rift has occured among Philippine
officials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief
negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.
    Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had
decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to
fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion
dlrs.
    "He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as
possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted," Monsod said.
    Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6
billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8
billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource
transfer in the same period.
    Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over
the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    Monsod said,  "Right now we are saying to the banks, let's
share the financing burden."
    Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of
multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth
facility to bridge the funding gap.
     He said the government and the consultative group would
meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid
donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to
finance any gap on a shared basis.
    He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to
pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility.
    Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.
"Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said. "She talks
and I listen but I don't necessarily agree."
    Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging
the financing gap would have aided the government's
pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.
    She said if private sector investment continued to be held
back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising
interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross
national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over
the next six years.
    "If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan.
How can there be a program if there is no finance?" she said,
adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.
    "It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult
for the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said.
    "Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going
to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not
be able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said.
    Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressed
Manila's policy was growth before debt.
    She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the
Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing
all debt repayments.
    "If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of
the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have
an option," Monsod said. "You just don't send it abroad. You do a
Brazil."

<TITLE>TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff
cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
A senior economic planner said.
    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
half of this year.
    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
faster and more substantially," he said.
    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
too selective.
     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
among the island's main export-earners.
    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
more generous terms.

Rhone-Poulenc &lt;RHON.PA> said it will increase its capital with
a 2.5 billion franc issue of preferential investment
certificates on March 9.
    Company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said 500 mln francs of
the issue will be placed in the U.S. Details of the issue will
be announced by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur on March 6.
    The group, due to be privatised at an unspecified date,
said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue
its development strategy and make further acquisitions.
    Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the
Paris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The
group's capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs.
    Fourtou, speaking at a news conference, did not give
details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987.
    He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial
investment program of around five billion francs, and research
spending of about 3.5 billion francs. Rhone-Poulenc spent 5.5
billion francs on acquisitions last year.
    "Chemistry is on the move and we face opportunities that
must be seized," Fourtou said.

<TITLE>HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>
expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not make any specific projections for the company's
earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
split.
    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
remaining shares.
    Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
export-led growth.
    Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.
May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
the British colony.
    He said all of the company's major operations showed
improved results in 1986.
    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to
&lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
Hongkong Electric.
    Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local
stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
    Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
    The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
    Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
the government for the spin-off.
    He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.
Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property
development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO.TO> of Canada
and Pearson Plc &lt;PSON.L> of Britain.

<TITLE>BALLADUR EXPECTS IMPROVED FEBRUARY INFLATION DATA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French inflation rate is expected to
show a substantial improvement in February after January's very
high 0.9 pct monthly rate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
said.
    He told a French television interviewer that half of the
high January rise, which took year on year inflation that month
to three pct, was due to higher oil prices.
    "Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecast
for price rises this year is two and a half pct," he said.
    Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target,
which the government had initially set at two pct for this
year, should not affect wage expectations for this year.
    "There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy,"
he said, referring to the government's aim of holding public
sector wage increases to three pct this year.
    Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in
1985.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. economy continued to expand in
February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    However, production remained vigorous as more than three
times as many members reported it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X>
gradually resumed production.
    An equal number of members reported inventories were higher
and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August
1984.
    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher
rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc &lt;PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL NEEDS MORE, FASTER FINANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil would not have suspended
payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more
and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    He said he would not seek more money from the International
Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and
said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.
    "It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't
finance a little bit more quickly and easily," Funaro told
reporters at the Brazilian Embassy.
    Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of
monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if
official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied,
"Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these
agencies."
    Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro
said "It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to
receive from the other side."
    Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs,
stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments
on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World
Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the
past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.
    He said the net transfer was hurting the country's
continued growth and capacity to import goods.
    "Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to
be found to finance a country like Brazil," Funaro said.
    He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he
would like to see "automatic" official lending when needed so
that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves,
now reported to be below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade
surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight
billion dlrs.
    But he said that without increased and faster lending from
official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export
earnings to finance development and imports and also service
its debt.
    "We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and
internal adjustment," Funaro said.
    He complained that official lending agencies had imposed
tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving
commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available.
    Funaro said U.S officials understand his position "but they
don't like it." Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe
and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany,
France, Switzerland and Italy.
    Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent
a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over
Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of
short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

<TITLE>SWISS HAVE NET GAIN IN 1985 GOVERNMENT FINANCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland recorded last year its first
overall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending with
a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministry
said.
    The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term
investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion
francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986
budget.
    All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and
expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast.
    The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18
billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61
billion proposed in the original 1986 budget.
    Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985
figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71
billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling
1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985
deficit of 696 mln.
    Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above
forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected
receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.
    Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than
planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.
    The ministry said the improvement in the overall account
reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to
introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax
increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of
inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil
prices were also important factors.
    A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used
its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs
of government debt, which accounted for the difference between
the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln
franc overall surplus.

<TITLE>APPLE COMPUTER &lt;AAPL> UPGRADES MACINTOSH LINE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dean Lokken</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Apple Computer Inc today will
announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable
Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the
business market.
    The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has
been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new
machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster
and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than
earlier models.
    The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Apple
says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,
goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging
from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.
    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than
the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced
between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.
    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for
about 2,200 dlrs.
    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld
Conference in Los Angeles.
    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers
at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance
Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the
expanding market for science and engineering workstations.
    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE
should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this
year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.
    "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for
most people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a real
power product for revenue."
    Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers
but expected the new products to do well.
    "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of
computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,"
he told Reuters. "The graphics interface on the Mac products is
significantly better than anything IBM has to date."
    International Business Machines is expected to announce
updated personal computers this spring.
    The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an
"open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerous
peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of
memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with
a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.
    In a demonstration of its speed and power, company
executives said they thought the Mac II would push the
development of software for Apple computers in new directions
that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail
systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use.
    The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256
colors or shades of gray.
    The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and
will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four
megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.
    Both new computers have two optional keyboards, a new
feature in the Apple line of products.

    After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New

<TITLE>LL/E ROYALTY &lt;LRT> REVENUES MAY BE ESCROWED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>LL and E Royalty Trust said Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co &lt;LLX>, the working interest owner for
its oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to start
placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue
to the trust.
    LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any
amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the
necessity of doing so.  The trust said "If the working interest
owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties
paid to the trust would be significant."  Royalties from the
properties are the trust's only source of income.
    The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary
annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted
present value of future net revenues from proved oil and
natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the
trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively
from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural
gas prices.
    It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have
actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates
reflect prices and costs only through September 30.
    The trust said using the September figures, the engineers
determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from
total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices
received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would
have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has
been some weakening in prices since January.
    The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in
estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama
and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986,
as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production
costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

<TITLE>PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.

<DATELINE>    KARACHI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan cotton production during the
current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375
pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman
of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.
    Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln
bales of cotton during the current financial year ending June
after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85.
    They said consumption would increase due to a rise in
demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan
produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and
exported 157 mln.
    The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to
export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year
compared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said.
    The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton
carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales
last year.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said
it is forming a new U.S. pharmaceuticals unit called ICI
Pharma.
    Combined sales of Imperial's existing Stuart
Pharmaceuticals unit and the new ICI Pharma are projected to be
1.1 billion dlrs in 1990, the company said.  Stuart had 1986
sales of 582 mln dlrs.
    Imperial said it plans to introduce several new drugs,
including diprivan, an anaesthetic, and zestril, a heart drug,
over the next three years. ICI Pharma and Stuart will operate
as separate units of ICI Pharmaceuticals Group, it said.
    Stuart Pharmaceuticals and ICI Pharma will have 1987 sales
of approximately 700 mln dlrs, about 450 mln dlrs from the new
ICI Pharma and 250 mln dlrs from Stuart, officials said.
    The combined sales force of about 900 sales people, split
about equally between the two units, will be slightly larger
than the existing sales force at Stuart.
    Regulatory approval for the annesthetic diprivan is
expected in late 1987, while zestril, a hypertension and heart
drug, should be approved in mid or late 1988, company officials
said.
    Approval for oth new drugs, including, statil, a treatment
for diabetic complications, is not expected until 1989 and
1990, the officials said.

    A spokesman said Alcan was closing the smelter, with annual
capacity of 44,000 tonnes and 320 employees, because of high
electricity costs and the low world market price of aluminium.
    Alkan had said earlier this year it would close half the
plant's capacity but decided to shut down completely when talks
with potential cooperation partners failed, the spokesman said.
He declined to name the other companies involved in the talks.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony
Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.
    BankAmerica Corp's &lt;BAC> Bank of America unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT>
RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books
on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.
    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more
closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to
market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.
    "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.
    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    The Bank of America certificates were issued by California
Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal
was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries
when First Boston priced the deal," one said.
    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.
    "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.
    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of
America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.
    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California
Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a
unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks
Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>, via
Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.
    The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>REAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Szekely</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>After a week that left his presidency
shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his
new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an
administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.
    Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,
whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan
praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing
criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with
Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.
    Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is
assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has
done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey
as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
    White House officials are checking to see how much support
Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have
if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote,
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.
    Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," the
Kansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in some
difficulty."
    Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority
by Baker.
    Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale
scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates
nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only
after months of congressional probes into the affair.
    "He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen.
and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. "He is a victim."
    Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week With
David Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is in
trouble." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said
the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.
    When asked on the syndicated television program, "John
McLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed,
the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn't bet any money on it.
    "I think this report hurts that," Nunn said. "It indicates
that the National Security Council had policy-type influence
over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into
that with Mr. Gates.
    Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report
prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief
of staff.
    Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury
secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past
two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the
botched handling of the Iran arms sale.
    The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on the
White House" since it was first revealed last November that
profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra
rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
    The two other victims of the scandal are former National
Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was
disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale
were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower
commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have
refused to testify.
    Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed
in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose
inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.
    That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and
threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves
office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found
that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership,
a record low, and a third believed he should consider
resignation.
    After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over
the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen.
John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television
address this week to respond to the criticisms of his
presidency.

<TITLE>CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK>
is expecting strong results this year after reporting better
than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told
reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19
cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a
four-for-one stock split.
    The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15
cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus
issue.
    Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in
1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion
dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln
dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel
to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> for one billion
dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local
property market and substantial increases in contributions from
associated companies.
    "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for
the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's)
exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial
buildings."
    Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in
the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a
land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is
exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a
second airport.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Viacom International Inc said it
received revised merger offers from &lt;National Amusements Inc>
and &lt;MCV Holdings Inc>.
    The company said the special committee plans to meet later
today to review both offers.
    Viacom said National Amusements' Arsenal Holdings Inc
raised the value of its offer for the Viacom shares not held by
National Amusements in three areas. National Amusements holds
19.6 pct of Viacom's stock.
    The cash value of the offer was raised to 42.00 dlrs from
the 40.50 dlrs a Viacom share offered February 23 while the
value of the fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred
being offered was increased to 7.50 dlrs a share from six dlrs.
The interest rate to be used to increase the cash value of the
merger, if delayed beyond April 30, was raised to nine pct from
eight pct and 12 pct after May 31.
    A Viacom spokesman said the Arsenal Holdings's offer
continues to include a 20 pct interest in Arsenal for present
Viacom shareholders.
    Viacom said MCV Holdings, a group which includes the
company's senior management and the Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the United States, raised the value of its offer by
increasing the value of the preferred being offered to 8.50
dlrs from 8.00 dlrs a share and raising the ownership in the
new company to be held by present Viacom shareholders to 45 pct
from 25 pct. MCV called its previous offer, made February 26,
the "final" proposed revision of its agreement with Viacom.

members have struck the news staffs of CBS Inc &lt;CBS> and
Capital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB> this morning after negotiations
for a new contract broke down.
    The guild said there had been extensions prior to the
strike deadline this morning, but said the strike was called
after the companies refused to negotiate.
    The guild said the companies failed to put a final offer on
the table, made no money offer at all, and did not deviate
substantially from their original proposals, which, the guild
said, would have gutted the union contract.
    The guild said the networks demanded the right to terminate
employees at will and lay them off without the  arbitration,
and the hiring of temporary employees to replace staffer
employees.
    The guild represents newswriters, editors, desk assistants,
researchers, production assistants, promotion writers and
graphic artists.
    The strike affects unions in New York, Chicago, Washington
and Los Angeles. Picketing will commence at corporate
headquarters in New York and other locations, the guild said.

<TITLE>MILLER TABAK HAS 91.8 PCT OF PENN TRAFFIC &lt;PNF></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Miller Tabak Hirsch and Co> said it
has received an accepted 3,424,729 common shares of Penn
Traffic Co in response to its 31.60 dlr per share tender offer
that expired Friday, and together with the 380,728 shares it
already owned, it now has about 91.8 pct of Penn Traffic.
    The company said Penn Traffic is expected to hold a special
shareholders' meeting later this month to approve a merger into
Miller Tabak at the tender price.
    It said two Miller Tabak representatives will be named to
the Penn Traffic board on March Four to serve as the only

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee quota talks at the International
Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this
afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached
common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export
quotas, delegates said.
    The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian
proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used
historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to
discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they
said.
    Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for
agreement at this time.
    "Anything could happen," one delegate said.

<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pittston Co said it has
tentatively agreed to acquire WTC International N.V. in a
tax-free exchange of stock.
    Pittston said it agreed to exchange 0.523 common share for
each of the about 8,612,000 WTC common shares outstanding.
    Pittston said WTC's three principal shareholders, who own
62 pct of its stock, are parties to this agreement. They have
granted Pittston the right of first refusal to their shares.
    WTC has granted Pittston an option to buy WTC shares equal
to 18.5 poct of its outstanding stock. The agreement is subject
to approval of both boards and WTC shareholders.
    Pittston said described WTC as a fast growing air freight
forwarding company with operations throughout the world. Its
revenues totaled nearly 200 mln dlrs in the year ended November
30 and for the quarter ended on that date it earned 1.3 mln
dlrs on revenues of 55.8 mln dlrs.
    Pittston said its Burlington Air Express subsidiary
generates about two-thirds of its 450 mln dlrs in annual
revenes with its domestic air freight services.

borrowing facilities to those discount houses wishing to use
them at 1430 GMT.
    The Bank also said it provided the money market 456 mln stg
assistance in the afternoon session bringing its total help so
far today to 493 mln stg. This compares with its forecast of a
shortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg.
    The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising
41 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct 361 mln stg in band two at
10-13/16 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 10-3/4 pct.
    Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently
used the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does
not want to see an early reduction in U.K. Base lending rates.
    The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at
rates of interest higher than its prevailing money market
dealing rates.

USDA LIFTS CROSS-COMPLIANCE FOR 1987 CROP OATS
    REPEAT FROM LATE FRIDAY
    WASHINGTON, Feb 27 - The USDA said it is lifting the
limited cross-compliance requirement for 1987 crop oats.
    Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said the action was being
taken to help alleviate the short supply of oats.
    Under limited cross compliance, the plantings of other
program crops on the farm may not exceed the crop acreage bases
of those crops.
    The lifting of the cross-compliance on oats permits the
planting of oats in excess of the oat acreage base without
sacrificing eligibility for other crop program benefits.
    Myers said soybean plantings are expected to decrease as a
result of the action on oats, planting of which are expected to
increase by two to three mln acres.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."
The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and
European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in
Washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West
Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with
governments.
    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and
Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.
The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.
    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems
with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only
partial servicing of the debt.
    "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance
for part of the service, because we cannot service all that," he
said. "I really think we have to change the old rules."
    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather
than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a
solution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to the
governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the
banks have some limits."
    "It is a political discussion from our point of view," he
said.
    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to
Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk
to the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from the
governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks." He was
not sure how long it would take to reach a solution.
 &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the
mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in
need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually
closed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said.
    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by
Brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood
Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.
    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "because
we can't stay as we were the last few years."
    "I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us
would like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. Although
Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call
in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to
World Bank President Barber Conable.
    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to
decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight
billion dlr trade surplus in 1987.
    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had
declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last
year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.
    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,
Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only
one pct.  "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," he
said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and
inducing an internal recession in order to service debt.
    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,

Mapinduzi (CCM) party has endorsed the government's economic
reform programme but said it did not think more changes, such
as a further devaluation of the shilling, would be needed.
    Tanzania has devalued the shilling more than 65 pct in less
than a year and has started to overhaul inefficient government
firms in line with a package agreed with the IMF.
    The CCM's national executive committee said it was
satisfied with government efforts to implement IMF conditions.
"Measures taken so far are satisfactory and there is no need to
take other ones -- the devaluation of the shilling included," it
said.
    The committee's statement was in response to a government
report on the IMF package submitted last Thursday.

Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the
growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign
Trade official said.
    Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile
export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988,
based on the value of 1985 exports.
    The official said the pact was unfair because the United
States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and
South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until
1991.
    He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its
two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of
the surging value of the Taiwan dollar.

<TITLE>CONSOLIDATED TVX TO BUY BRAZIL GOLD MINE STAKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Consolidated TVX Mining Corp> said it
agreed to issue 7.8 mln treasury shares to acquire interests in
three gold mining companies in Brazil and an option to increase
the company's interest in a platinum property.
    The company said the transactions will bring immediate
production and earnings to Consolidated TVX, enhance its
precious metal potential and is expected to improve cash flow
and earnings on a per share basis. The company did not give
specific figures.
    Consolidated TVX said it will acquire 29 pct of CMP, a
public gold mining company in which TVX already holds a 15 pct
interest, making TVX the largest single shareholder.
    The company also agreed to acquire a 19 pct stake in Novo
Astro, a private company, and a 16 pct interest in Teles Pires
Mining, increasing the TVX's ownership to 51 pct.
    In addition, Consolidated TVX said it will acquire the
right to add a 10 pct interest to a platinum property in which
it already owns a 29.4 pct stake.
    CMP earned 11 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986 and expects to
produce 42,000 ounces of gold in 1987 at a cost of 160 U.S.
dlrs an ounce, Consolidated TVX said.
    Novo Astro operates Brazil's richest gold mine located in
Amapa State, with an average grade of 0.8 ounces of gold a ton
in a hardrock quartz vein, Consolidated TVX said. Mining of
eluvial surface material produced 25,000 ounces in 1986 and is
expected to produce 60,000 ounces in 1987.
    It also said Teles Pires Mining controls rights to a 350
kilometer section of the Teles Pires River, where one dredge is
expected to produce 10,000 ounces of gold in 1987.

<TITLE>NUCLEAR DATA &lt;NDI> GETS EXTENSIONS ON LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nuclear Data Inc said its bank lenders
agreed to extend its secured loan agreement through June 30,
1987.
    The agreement, which covers about 9.5 mln dlrs in short
term debt, had been scheduled to expire February 28.
    Terms of the extension require Nuclear Data to obtain
replacement financing from outside sources before June 30, it
said.
    If the company is unable to or fails to achieve certain
projected operating results in the meantime, it will be
required to divest enough assets to retire its debt, it said.
    For the first nine months of its fiscal 1987 year ended
November 30, 1986, Nuclear Data reported a loss of almost nine
mln dlrs or 4.98 dlrs a share on revenues of 32.6 mln dlrs.
    Nuclear Data cited improvement in printed circuit board
sales and said it is confident it will obtain replacement
financing.
    In other action, Nuclear Data said it set up a 1.25 mln
dlrs reserve to cover the revaluation of certain domestic
medical inventory and the redirection of its U.S. medical sales
efforts.
    The reserve was taken to offset a decline in the U.S.
dollar against the Danish Kroner and other factors adversely
affecting sales of its Danish manufactured medical products in
the U.S. market, Nuclear Data said.

<TITLE>U.K. SAYS HAS NO ROLE IN BRAZIL MORATORIUM TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that
negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter
for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks
this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities
to be able to present a convincing economic program to the
country's creditors. He added an accord with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks.
    Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a
clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official
cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.
    Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco
Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an
attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite
suspension of interest payments earlier this month.
    Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the
IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity
program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption
would lead to recession and threaten democracy.
    Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of
their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts
to change the means by which developing countries finance
growth.
    Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not
have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and
faster financing from international agencies.
    He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching
governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves
about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks have
some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of
view."
    Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials
had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve
Brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial
contact.
    He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had
been at Funaro's request.
    After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerland
and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week
before starting negotiations with banks.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Union of Mineworkers,
NUM, said it will demand a 55 pct annual wage increase in
upcoming negotiations with South Africa's mining companies.
    The union, representing some 360,000 black workers at about
118 mines, last year sought a 45 pct boost in salaries and
settled for 23.5 pct.
    NUM General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa told a news
conference the miners were "very angry at low wages...And are
prepared to press their struggle for as long as it takes to get
their demands met."
    Salaries for black miners currently range from a low of 195
rand or 94 dlrs a month to 800 rand, or 384 dlrs, with an
average monthly wage of 345 rand or 165 dlrs, Ramaphosa said.
    He also said the union has asked the mining companies to
begin new contract talks on April one instead of the usual May
one starting time. The current one-year contract expires at the
end of June.

reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of
customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves
directly instead via System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at

under upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year
notes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study group said the United States
should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln
barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact
of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.
    U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private
group, also called for new research for oil exploration and
development techniques.
    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a
barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with
imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.
    It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves
and more exploration and development research would help to
guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

plans to build 485,000 cars in the April-June period, compared
with 497,000 a year ago.
    Ford's new production schedule represents a 12 pct increase
from previous production plans for cars and 10 pct for trucks,
Ward's said.

<TITLE>REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM &lt;VIA> OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>French operators last Friday requested
licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
French trade sources said.
    The latest requests for the maize were for export to
Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
Ecu daily rebate.
    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
dispute over grain sales to Spain.
    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
context to 25,500 tonnes.
    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an
unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

<TITLE>STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study group said the United States
should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln
barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact
of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.
    U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private
group, also called for new research for oil exploration and
development techniques.
    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a
barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with
imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.
    The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to
protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such
device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.
    But the group did not strongly back either option, saying
there were benefits and drawbacks to both.
    It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves
and more exploration and development research would help to
guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Carbide Corp is looking to
acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and
plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of
Chemicals and Plastics.
    Describing this as a major departure in the company's
approach to commercial development, he told the annual new
business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We
are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
markets we've identified."
    Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if
we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it
was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger
explained.
    He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable
market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
up profitably with someone who is already there."
    He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
same way.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp's GMAC Financial
Services said it plans to offer 25 billion dlrs in pre-approved
credit to more than two mln "preferred customers" in a
nationwide direct mail campaign.
    The GM unit said the program is the largest automotive
credit offer of its kind in history.
    GMAC Financial Services said the mailing will be completed
by early March. Selected current GMAC customers will receive
offers of pre-approved credit equal to the cash selling price
of the vehicles they are currently financing, rounded up to the
next 1,000 dlrs.
    Within this group, Buick owners will also receive a special
discount of 300 dlrs that would be provided by GM's Buick motor
division if they accept GMAC's offer to finance or lease a new
Buick.

<TITLE>CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government is expected
to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn
exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.
government and farm group representatives said.
    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.
    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a
similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,
Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the
Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn
exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.
    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn
imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last
month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to 
corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch port and transport union, FNV,
agreed to an employers' request to reconvene abandoned peace
talks tonight to try to end strikes that have disrupted
Rotterdam's general cargo sector for the past six weeks, a
union spokesman said.
    Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after
employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which
started January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800
from the sector's 4,000 workforce, starting with 350 this year.
    The employers' invitation to restart the talks comes on the
day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf
for a resolution of the dispute expires.
    De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he
would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the
sector.
    No comment was immediately available from the employers'
organization.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community steelmakers
presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan
for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be
forced reluctantly to accept.
    Under the plan steel output would remain subject to
restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for
years to come while steel firms undertook a massive
slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.
    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the
ending of the quota system by December 1988.
    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC
law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."
    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this
idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in
their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to
alternative products and accounts firmly in the red.
    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are
likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the
industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the
political impact of plant closures, they said.
    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the
EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota
production system at least until the end of 1990.
    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it
identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to
reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.
    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that
of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.
    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the
Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program,
particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.
    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this
decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Stock Exchange said its ruling
council has decided to close the trading floor for government
bonds (gilts) and equities in due course because most of the
business is now done between brokers' offices.
    A trading floor for traded options will be retained.
    Dwindling activity on the exchange floor reflects the
introduction of the new dealing system, known as SEAQ, which
was part of the Big Bang restructuring of the market last
October. Since then, brokers and market-makers have been
dealing on the basis of competing share quotes displayed on
screens.

<TITLE>CME PLANS RULE CHANGES TIGHTENING S/P TRADING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Directors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition
asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading
activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock
Index futures pit, an exchange executive said.
    The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal
practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade
for their own account.
    But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an
opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called
"front-running", where traders enter orders for their own account
before executing orders for their customers.
    Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule
on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P
Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures
trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to
submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.
    In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed
said the special committee will also make suggestions about a
possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P
500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would
alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.
    Melamed said directors are likely to approve the
recommendations of the special committee because "most actions
of the board are in line with committee recommendations."
    CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board
accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be
submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for
approval.
    If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,
a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership
for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.
    Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on
before the recommendations from the special committee are made
"it will confuse the issue."
    Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict
dual trading.
    Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most
exchanges.
    "It's a question of the integrity of the person you do
business with," Wolff said.
    Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that
trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up
for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in
chaotic futures trading pits.
    "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult
for a broker to function because of his errors," said John
Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.
    "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"
he said.
    Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage
makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.
    "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or
even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michael
said.
    An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for
instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day
at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.  Even figuring
what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such
brokerage can be lucrative.
    Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of
an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the
brokerage business, Michael said.

Trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the
portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58
dlrs per mln Btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln Btu.
    The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in
the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this
reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.

<TITLE>INVESTOR GROUP HAS TALKS WITH PESCH ON AMI &lt;AMI></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>WEDGE Group Inc, a Houston investment
firm with a 5.5 pct stake in American Medical International
Inc, said it has had talks with Pesch and Co, which is seeking
control of the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living
in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of
joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI.
    WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control
of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future.
    WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management,
Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern
controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI
shareholders.
    It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues --
selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try
-- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did
not produce any agreements or understandings.
    WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of
AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate
at this time."
    WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said
it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch
and other shareholders.
    Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22
dlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based
on AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share
bid, which the company rejected.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks at the extended special meeting of
the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the
reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of
success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.
    Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian
proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,
with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new
quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop
year, they said.
    Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a
quota agreement varied widely.
    Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly
more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of
its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks
likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.
    No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had
been tabled formally today, delegates said.
    A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a
progress report, delegates said.

<TITLE>SEC STAFF ADVISES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST WPPSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The staff of the federal Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the
Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with
securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on
2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters.
    WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by
SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be
asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official
statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear
power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was
selling the bonds.
    English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staff
planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for
power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants,
which were to built with the bonds' proceeds.
    English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made no
public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond
sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.
    "We at all times told the public everything we knew about
the costs," he said.
    English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC might
meet on the staff's recommendations.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, never comments on its
enforcement activities.
    The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and the
agency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized on
several occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC's
budget and operations.
    Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS,
one has been completed, two remain under construction, and two
others--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- have
been terminated.

recently acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd in preparation
for the companies' merger this summer.
    Pacific Western said it appointed president and chief

was previously president of Pacific Western's airline unit,
Pacific Western Airlines Ltd.
    Pacific Western acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines for 300

    Canadian Pacific Air Lines said president and chief
executive Donald Carty and four senior vice-presidents resigned
last week. Carty said in a company memorandum that he accepted
another senior post in commercial aviation and that some of the
vice-presidents were taking early retirment and others were
resigning for personal reasons.
    Pacific Western said the new management structure "will
facilitate our objective of proceeding quickly to successfully
position ourselves in the marketplace as a single airline
network beginning this summer."

<TITLE>AIBD, CEDEL, EUROCLEAR JOIN IN TRADE MATCH SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of International Bond
Dealers, AIBD, said it will cooperate with major clearing
agencies Cedel and Euroclear on a eurobond trade confirmation
and matching system to come into force by September this year.
    The system, designed to give market participants a fast and
reliable way of checking whether transactions are matched, will
initially cover reporting of confirmed and mismatched trades.
    It will include recording additional trade data, checking,
comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply
initially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.
    The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for
developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems
when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and
confirmation systems by September this year.
    Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one"
matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered
by 1000 London time, designed to work with a planned AIBD rule
requiring the entry of previous day's trades by that time.
    The confirmation system covering critical trade data is
designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and
also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.

<TITLE>IRISH OIL CONCERN HAS 8.5 PCT OF CYNERGY &lt;CRG></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bryson Oil and Gas Plc, a Belfast,
Northern Ireland, oil company, said it has acquired an 8.5 pct
stake in Cynergy Corp and took steps to help it consider the
possibility of seeking control or influencing the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
which it disclosed its stake, Bryson said it also asked Cynergy
for a list shareholder list in case it decided to communicate
with the holders.
    Shareholder information would be vital to anyone planning a
tender offer and is commonly requested by individuals or groups
mulling takeover attempts.
    Bryson told the SEC it may review the feasibility of trying
to influence the management policies of Cynergy, or of trying
to gain control of the company through representation on its
board of directors.
    A shareholder list would also be necessary for a group
trying to mount a campaign for the election of directors.

<TITLE>AIBD, CEDEL, EUROCLEAR JOIN IN TRADE MATCH SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of International Bond
Dealers, AIBD, said it will cooperate with major clearing
agencies Cedel and Euroclear on a eurobond trade confirmation
and matching system to come into force by September this year.
    The system, designed to give market participants a fast and
reliable way of checking whether transactions are matched, will
initially cover reporting of confirmed and mismatched trades.
    It will include recording additional trade data, checking,
comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply
initially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.
    The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for
developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems
when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and
confirmation systems by September this year.
    Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one"
matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered
by 1000 London time, designed to work with a planned AIBD rule
requiring the entry of previous day's trades by that time.
    The confirmation system covering critical trade data is
designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and
also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.

<TITLE>OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OIL MARKET BEING MANIPULATED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KINGSTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused
"oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks and
spreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its
15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last December.
    Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the
18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.
    "People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPEC
by drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this is
having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the
market which we know is not real," Lukman said.
    Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said that despite probable
"minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically OPEC
is producing around what it said it would produce."
    After OPEC's price and production accord last December, the
market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to
around 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization was
producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February.
    But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain its
discipline, in view of past experience. "We have the experience
of what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations of
agreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.
    Lukman was in Kingston as a guest of the state-owned
Petroleum Corp of Jamaica.

upgraded 500 mln dlrs of debt of Navistar International Corp
and its unit Navistar Financial Corp.
    Raised were the companies' senior debt to BB from B and
subordinated debt to B-plus from CCC-plus.
    S and P cited Navistar's recent issuance of 104 mln shares
of common stock and planned redemption of 515 mln dlrs of debt.
The recapitalization would save Navistar about 86 mln dlrs in
annual interest expense, the rating agency said.
    However, the ratings remain speculative because of severe
pricing pressures in the trucking industry, S and P stressed.

police in this northeastern city during a march to demand a
better deal from the EC, protest organisers said.
    The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets
and occupied local government buildings in Saragossa.
    In the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more
than 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets to protest against
duties levied by the EC against their exports.
    Spain joined the community in January last year and farmers
say they have suffered competition from EC imports without
sufficient compensation.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER TO SELL CARS IN EUROPE BEFORE YEAR END</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp &lt;C> will begin exporting
vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, the world's
second largest market, which it left in 1978.
    Robert Lutz, executive vice president, told a news
briefing: "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about
to re-enter the European market. And we are here to stay."
    Michael Hammes, vice president of international operations,
said Chrysler planned to market "a few hundred vehicles" by year
end. "By the end of 1988, we hope to reach 5,000." The first cars
would be sold in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he
said.
    The European base would be in West Germany, but no final
decision had been made on other sites.
    The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, but
intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the
vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.
    Lutz commented, "We prefer to export to Europe rather than
manufacture here because it will allow us to take full
competitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due to
the declining value of the dollar."
    The vehicles, on show at this week's Geneva motor show,
include Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible, the Dodge
Lancer ES four-door hatchback, the Dodge Shadow ES compact, the
Plymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z.
    Chrysler is aiming for the mainstream European buyer, who
appreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines, officials said.
    Prior to negotiating a loan guarantee program with the U.S.
Government in 1978, Chrysler sold its European operations to
Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.P>. Chrysler now owns 24 pct of Mitsubishi
Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> and 15 pct of &lt;Maserati>, which may serve
as European distribution channels in future, Hammes said.

    A full ICO council meeting is set for 1900 hours local for
a progress report. Opinions among delegates over the potential
for reaching an agreement vary widely and several delegates
have said the chances of success were almost impossible to

<TITLE>FORD &lt;F> AIR-BAG PROGRAM FLAGGING - REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co's program to introduce
air-bags in its compact cars is facing widespread resistance
from both consumers and dealers, a trade paper said.
    As of February 20, Automotive News said Ford dealers had
sold only 455 1987-model Ford Tempos equipped with airbags and
294 similarly-equipped Mercury Topaz models compared with more
than 100,000 of the standard-equipped compact models.
    Ford has projected output of 12,000 Tempo and Topaz models
equipped with airbags in the 1987 model year, but Automotive
News said the current inventory of unsold cars represents a
disastrously high 1-1/2-year supply at current selling rates.
    Most of Ford's sales of the compact cars equipped with air
bags have been made to fleet buyers such as the U.S.
government, the paper said, with 11,000 having been sold since
they were announced in late 1985.
    Ford executives recently said their goal is to sell
annually between 500,000 and one mln cars equipped with air
bags by 1990 if the federal government will relax certain
regulatory standards as has been urged by some traffic safety
administrative staff.

downgraded to A-plus from AA-minus about 350 mln dlrs of senior
debt of PACCAR Inc and its unit PACCAR Financial Corp.
    S and P said PACCAR has experienced earnings weakness. But
the company remains profitable and should achieve significant

    The rating agency pointed out that price discounting has
eroded some of PACCAR's pricing advantage in the premium,
custom-built segment of the trucking industry, which is
PACCAR's traditional market niche.

<TITLE>ZIMBABWE'S MAIZE MOUNTAIN POSES ECONOMIC PROBLEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Gregson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>More than two mln tonnes of surplus maize
dotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic
headache for the country.
    The grain, Southern Africa's staple, has been bought by the
Grain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it was
planted, and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month in
storage and interest payments to make the purchases.
    Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the
surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and
is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly.
    Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as European
countries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in
return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where the
United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the
hungry.
    But transport constraints keep those figures low and the
only significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to South
Africa last year.
    Because of the costs it has incurred, the GMB cannot afford
to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been
accumulating, economists here said.
    But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets
is damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance
imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added.
    "At present, it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some of
the extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
called for at the weekend will be spent here," a Western aid
specialist said.
    "At least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the
situation too badly," he added. Rainfall during the current
rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the
irrigated lands of large commercial farmers.
    While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year
to the GMB, the government also acted late last year to slash
maize production and force diversification.
    Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds,
Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viable
price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half
the amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986, and above that
growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs.
    The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops,
such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the
Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February.

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/CHIP INDUSTRY SEEKS CUSTOM DESIGNS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Catherine Arnst, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,
struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly looking
toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for
future profits.
    The market for customized chips - semiconductors designed
for a very specific application or product - is expected to
expand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about six
pct for the entire integrated circuit industry.
     Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales of
customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last
year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990, however,
customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15
billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales.
    More important for their vendors, because they are not a
standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market,
and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly.
    High volume memory chips have become "a perfect commodity
market," Robert Brodersen, a professor of electrical
engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, told
an industry forum.
    "The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer
and another and customers base their buying decisions almost
entirely on price," Brodersen said. 
    He predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful of
the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese)
will produce memory chips, the standard electronic component
found in everything from digital watches to computers. "The
rest of the industry just won't be involved."
    Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference,
the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemed
to support Brodersen's prediction.
     Of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pct
had Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the
United States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the
memory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co's
attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory
(dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now
available.
    The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company
was International Business Machine Corp's &lt;IBM> four mln bit
chip, and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use,
not for the open market.
    The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on
the same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy
and inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese
conglomerates as Sony Corp &lt;SNE>, NEC Corp, &lt;NIPNY> Matushita
and Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics
product lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for
their chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low
cost per unit.
    Customized chips, however, are designed for a specific
customer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive
relative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly
looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,
thus making the final product harder to clone as well.
    Intel Corp &lt;INTC>, the leading manufacturer of the
microprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted
the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips
last fall.
    The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it
will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself
into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.
    Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a
piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage
that the others do not. IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake in
Intel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000
chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those
designs and sell them to others.
    It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer system
for designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the
most advanced in the world.
    Intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. Industry
analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market
item than a customized chip that requires a close working
relationship with the customer.
    Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its
newest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time,
and much lower development costs, will be required for
customized chips if the firm is to succeed.

<TITLE>CONTINENTAL ILL &lt;CIL> TO RECHARACTERIZE LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp settled an
administrative complaint by the Securities and Exchange
Commission by agreeing to recharacterize 425 mln dlrs
previously reported in the second quarter 1984 as a "loss of
sale on loans."
    Under the settlement, which was announced simultaneously
with the filing of the SEC's administrative action, Continental
agreed to restate earlier financial reports to single out the
425 mln dlrs as a separate loan loss item instead of lumping it
together with another item. The bank holding company said the
change does not affect its operating results for 1984.
    The SEC stressed in the complaint that it was not
challenging Continental's reported net loss for the second
quarter of 1984.
    But it said it was misleading for the bank to split the 950
mln dlr loan loss provision in half, attributing 425 mln dlrs
of it to the event of sale.
    The 425 mln dlrs should have been part of a 950 mln dlr
billion dlr loan loss provision required by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, the SEC said.
    Continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan
loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs as a
loss on sale of loans, the SEC said.
    It was misleading for the bank to list the 425 mln dlrs as
loss on sale, which implied the loss would not have occurred
had there not been a sale of distressed loans to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp, the SEC said.
    The bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss
instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the
other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans,
the SEC said.
    Continental agreed to the settlement with the SEC without
admitting or denying any violations, the SEC said.
    But it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to
accommodate the SEC's objections and to report to its
shareholders a summarized version of the SEC's administrative
action against it, the agency said.
    A Continental official stressed that the settlement in no
way will result in any change or restatement of the company's
earnings for that period.

cash flow are likely to continue for some time.
    This will result in stress on debt-protection measures,
although the firm's continuing core businesses have strong

<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S> DEAN WITTER UNIT AGREES TO SEC CENSURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal regulators said Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc, the brokerage subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck and
Co, agreed to a censure to settle charges that it failed to
fully report cash transactions.
    In a complaint which was issued simultaneously with the
settlement, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dean
Witter, the fourth largest U.S. brokerage house, with failing
to report more than one mln dlrs of cash transactions.
    In its administrative complaint, the SEC stressed that was
not charging Dean Witter with taking part in a scheme to
launder cash.
    But it said it found 35 single lump sum cash deposits in
excess of 10,000 dlrs made with Dean Witter's branch offices
and another three multiple cash deposits made by a customer on
a single day which totaled more than 10,000 dlrs. The total
unreported cash was 1,062,234 dlrs, the agency said.
    Federal law requires brokerage firms and banks to report to
the Treasury Department all cash deposits greater than 10,000
dlrs.
    After examining seven pct of the Dean Witter's branch
offices between July 1983 and April 1985, the SEC said it found
that the firm reported 1,880,376 dlrs in cash deposits, each of
which had been greater than 10,000 dlrs, but failed to report
another 1,062,234 dlrs.
    Besides agreeing to the censure, Dean Witter agreed to
tighten its oversight of its branch offices.
    Another major brokerage firm, E.F. Hutton Group Inc,
recently disclosed in an SEC filing that a federal grand jury
in Providence, R.I., was probing its compliance with cash
deposit reporting requirements at its Providence office.

effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing
countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year
started March 1, a government official said.
    The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin
Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and
boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto
appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from
its strategic stockpile.
    "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large
influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said
Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the
State Department. Last year the United States released about
4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.

accept for payment after the close of business today all the
common shares of Rexnord Inc that were tendered under its 26.25
dlr per share tender offer.
    Banner said its offer for all of the roughly 20 mln shares

    Combined with the roughly five mln shares it already holds,
Banner said it will own about 97 pct of Rexnord's shares.
    Banner said last Friday that it had arranged bank credit to
finance most of the tender offer and the subsequent merger with
Rexnord, under which remaining Rexnord holders may receive
26.25 dlrs a share.
    It said the balace of the funds will be obtained through a

<TITLE>DOT REJECTS SMOKING BAN ON DOMESTIC FLIGHTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) has concluded that a ban on smoking on all domestic
airline flights is not justified at this time.
    The department made known its conclusions in a report to
Congress, made public today, on a recommendation by the
National Academy of Sciences that such a ban be adopted.
    "We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could
be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However, we
believe that further study is needed before the department can
propose a definitive response to this recommendation," the DOT
report said.
    The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied the
issue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant.
    It recommended a ban in August after concluding that
tobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner's cabin, posed
potential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated 
passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires.
    The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects of
environmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration and
distribution of pollutants on various aircraft types.
    It also called for more study of possible changes in
aircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend more
time considering whether a ban should be extended to 
international as well as domestic flights.

<TITLE>AMC &lt;AMO> SAYS STEPS TAKEN AFTER UAW TALKS FAIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corp said it will take
steps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified
"alternative location" after the weekend breakdown of talks
with the United Automobile Workers union on a concessionary
contract covering workers at AMC's Wisconsin operations.
    AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the company
will not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at its
Kenosha, Wisc., assembly plant as a result of the talks'
failure.
    "We sincerely regret this outcome, but the responsibility
for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining
committees," the company said in a statement.
    "We will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary to
place the new Jeep product in an alternative location rather
than at Kenosha."
    UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regard
the collapse of talks as final after the company's "final"
proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union
bargainers.
    But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessions
package means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose
6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha "will not be
getting new work" as had been proposed with a new contract.
    "This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of
maintaining existing working and bringing new work to existing
U.S. operations," AMC said.
    Asked if the company considered the decision to phase out
the Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final,
Northard said: "If the union came to us and said they would
accept our final proposal, that's another matter."
    But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75
had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower labor
rates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated a
concessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations.
    AMC, which last week reported its first profitable quarter
in two years, said it wanted a contract for the plants with
labor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between the
UAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S.
    Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse by
driving down AMC's stock price. In active trading, AMC was off
3/8 to 3-1/2, a 9.7 pct decline since Friday's close.

<TITLE>GULF ARAB OIL MEETING ENDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy oil ministers of the six-nation
Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) ended a meeting here after
discussing co-ordination and co-operation in the oil field, the
Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency (GNA) said.
    The deputy ministers, who declined to talk to reporters on
the outcome of the 90 minute formal session, later concluded a
round of informal talks.
    The GCC groups four OPEC members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  and non-OPEC nations
Bahrain and Oman.
    Before the formal session had begun, chairman Yousef
Shirawi, Bahrain's Development and Industry Minister, told
reporters the gathering was a follow-up to talks held last
Sunday in Qatar at full ministerial level.
    GNA gave no details on the outcome of today's talks.
    It said only, "The deputy ministers discussed current
developments in the oil market, particularly those relating to
production and prices."
    The meeting in Qatar had reaffirmed the six Gulf Arab
countries' commitment to OPEC's pricing and production accord
forged in December last year.
    It also discussed ways of marketing crude oil on behalf of
those GCC states encountering resistance to official OPEC
prices.
    Oil industry sources have said Qatar has faced particular
difficulty in selling its full quota of production.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GOVERNMENT BOND BROKER SEES WIDER DATA ACCESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The major U.S. Government bond brokers
are likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors
within the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens
available to many of those firms that are not now eligible to
receive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairman of Exco International
Inc.
    Earlier today, Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in
RMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers
that dominate the business.
    In a telephone interview, Lacy said "Within 18 months, we
think the number of players will be expanded."
    Currently, the four major brokers will sell their
direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S.
Government securities or those that have applied to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.
    The U.S. Justice department is looking into whether
limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers
is a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws.
    Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite
group of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly
from the Fed.
    But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the
brokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as
far-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens
available to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is
more likely that a "second tier" will be established.
    He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from the
group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens
widely available to any one who wants them.
    Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better
prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major
competitors.
    Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure
for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any
time soon. In late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were
cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.
    Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that
with further increases in transaction volume, fees can be cut
without hurting the brokers' profits.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS STRUGGLE TO AGREE ON DAIRY CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community, EC, agriculture
ministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at
limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at
high guaranteed EC prices, diplomats said.
    The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut
dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last
December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.
    The accord, which is due to operate from the start of the
new milk marketing year on April 1, was hailed as the most
significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC
farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.
    Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not
threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened
if the proposals are altered too radically.
    West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on
a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into
public stores when market prices and stocks are high.
    Faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnes
costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged
to cut production to meet demand.
    He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before
the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price
review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales
to other sectors such as cereals.

<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S> TO RESTRUCTURE DISTRIBUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sears, Roebuck and Co said it will
restructure its distribution operations, resulting in a 20 mln
dlr after-tax charge against earnings in its first quarter.
    The retailer on April 30 will close its major Chicago
distribution center as the first part of the restructuring. A
spokesman said up to 1,800 workers will be affected, with many
of them laid off. Some of the workers may be transferred to
other Sears operations.
    Sears said the restructuring and consolidation will save
about 150 mln dlrs by 1991.
    Sears said it will set up a nationwide network of seven
regions to handle all aspects of distribution of its products.
    The closing of the Chicago plant will be followed by the
shutdown of four other distribution units over the next several
years. Distribution centers will be closed in Boston, Atlanta,
Memphis and Minneapolis, with the Boston shutdown coming early
next year. No other closings are planned before 1989.
    A spokesman said that, while there will be layoffs at those
facilities, the company does not yet know how many workers will
be let go.
    Sears' distribution will be consolidated under regional
management in Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Greensboro, N.C.,
Jacksonville, Fla., Kansas City, Mo., Los Angeles and
Philadelphia. However, Sears said it will also evaluate the
productivity of the Los Angeles and Philadelphia facilities "to
determine whether they will be modernized or relocated."
    Responsibility for ordering distribution center inventory
will be centralized in Chicago.

<TITLE>VERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary
has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker
for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie
said.
    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific
Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8
icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and
engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.
    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln
dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the
construction of the vessel.
said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be
required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically
and financially capable of performing the work."
    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than
competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of
direct employment.
    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most
powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and
completed in 1992.
    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last
year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast
Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest
Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the
journey, claiming the area was an international water way.
    The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up
the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic.

<TITLE>CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuba has told international sugar
operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that
these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct
shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.
    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the
language of the message was not totally clear and some believed
shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet
Union as the destination of their contracts.
    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last
week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export
availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.
    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately
available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was
probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender
last month.
    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward
delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the
sale of several cargoes.
    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive
March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export
markets, traders said.

<TITLE>GOODRICH &lt;GR> TO PHASE OUT SOME BUSINESSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>B.F. Goodrich Co said it will phase
out the production of aircraft tires, missile and marine
products and molded rubber products in Akron, Ohio, by the end
of 1987, laying off about 790 salaried, production, maintenance
and support services employees.
    The company said layoffs will start within the next few
weeks.
    Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and
adhesives in Akron, employing about 356.  Another 5000 salaried
employees in Akron work for Goodrich.
    The company said it has not been able to operate the
businesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to
justify the large investment that it has in them.
    Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at
Norwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will
relocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet
chosen.  It said it will stop making insulators for missiles.
    Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of
the United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected
employees and issues related to the continued operation in
Akron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the
phaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and
molded rubber products manufacturing.
    A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse
impact on earnings from the move.

<TITLE>(RPT) U.S. SAYS TIN DISPOSALS WILL NOT AFFECT ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. tin disposals should have little
effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing
countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year
started March 1, a government official said.
    The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin
Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and
boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto
appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from
its strategic stockpile.
    "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large
influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said
Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the
State Department. Last year the United States released about
4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.

<TITLE>DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS &lt;DPCZ> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diagnostic Products Corp president and
chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to
maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in
1987 as the company has for the past five years.
    "We expect the same performance in net income over the next
five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
    Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
    Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
test kits.
    Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
    Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
income in 1987.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Currency fluctuations may reassert their
influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion
bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.
    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any
reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.
    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears
that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.
    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable
long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the
Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.

<TITLE>NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Mercantile Exchange set
April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program "will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

bid by Diagnostic Retrieval Systems Inc for 22 dlrs a share.
    Rospatch earlier requested its stock be halted in over the

    Diagnostic said its bid was for a total 53 mln dlrs through
a cash tender offer for all, but not less than 51 pct of
Rosptach outstanding common.
    For its fourth-quarter ended December 31, 1986, Rospatch
reported net loss 2,649,000 or 1.10 dlrs a share compared a
loss of 627,500 or 35 cts profit for the 1985 period.
    In December the Brookehill Group in New York said it had
9.7 pct stake. J.A. Parini, Rospatch chief executive, responded
on January eight by saying the investment was a vote in

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A bidding war for Viacom International
Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20
days from the day we mail," said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the
company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>.
The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films
and other programs for television.

<TITLE>U.S. ELECTRONIC SALES FLAT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. electronic companies'
sales last year totalled 226.5 billion dlrs, slightly below the
228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American Electronic
Association said.
    Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1
billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of
1984, the AEA said.
    AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, although
the 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at the
end of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figures
before trying to forecast the future.
    "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector,
are still being impacted by the enormous and growing trade
deficit with Japan," he said.
    Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1
pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were
22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985.
    The association represents more than 2,800 firms that
produce electronic goods and services.

<TITLE>TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's decision to raise the issue
of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see
as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy
study group said 
    "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,
when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar
world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.
    U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer
aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,
the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments
of about 150 billion dlrs annually.
    The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline
of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in
U.S.-Canadian relations.
   The study said liberalized trade between the two countries
would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world
markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.
    The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied away
from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be
overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer
association with a country 10 times their size in population."
    But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their
domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and
sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an
increasingly competitive world.
    The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly
interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against 
allegedly subsidized exports.
    A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed
on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being
subsidized.
    The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending
curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and
the so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcasting
and films.
    It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense
cooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian
assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.

<TITLE>UAL &lt;UAL> UNIT ATTACKED ON MINORITY HIRING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>UAL Inc's United Airlines was accused in
a congressional hearing today of locking blacks out of key
jobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress in
minority hiring.
    The issue was aired during a hearing of a House Government
Operations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins,
called the treatment of minorities by the country's largest
airline "pathetic."
    "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that the
number of white women pilots is more than double that of black
pilots, and that white women are more fairly represented in
upper management."
    United has been under a court order since 1976 to increase
its minority employment.
    David Pringle, United's senior vice president for human
resources, said "We take a very aggressive approach to minority
hiring and have made tremendous progress ... we will continue
to pursue even wider goals."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ICI &lt;ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the
largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its
specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better
its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.
    "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added
businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told
reporters at an informal meeting here.
    ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.
drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart
Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current
pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.
    Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in
the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."
    ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug
maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were
about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,
which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.
    He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division
would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.
    "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate
of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who
was also at the meeting.
    Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically
act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs
to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.
    Henderson said the major new products in the company's
pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs
annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,
Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,
a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
    Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing
agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected until
about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin
in the U.S. later this year.
    Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986
income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15
billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.
    Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden
Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a
unit of Hanson Industries Inc.
    Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs
available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40
acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more
acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an
acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."
    Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective
April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who
will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the
earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years
after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

<TITLE>FUNARO REJECTS UK SUGGESTION OF IMF BRAZIL PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro
flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek
International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt
negotiations with commercial creditor banks.
    Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not
help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended
indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external
debt on February 20.
    Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of
European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt
moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve
capital flows between developed countries and third world
debtor nations.
   Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could
be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan
after a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very big
recession."
    "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and
import less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said.
    Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his
talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the
U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a
problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.
    Britain also believed an IMF program would help along
negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the
statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright
rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said.
    "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "But
if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then
that means nothing is helping to find a solution."
    Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and
in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to
unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to
deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.
    "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my
country," he said.
    He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's
efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the
two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring
meetings in Washington, Funaro said.
    Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's
debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to
Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.
    "We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said,
"We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what
happens."
    Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current
domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead
to a five pct economic growth this year.
    "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and
received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said.
"What we have to offer is our cooperation."

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>All major grain producing countries
must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.
wheat organizations said.
    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point
for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel
they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world
grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said
in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
    Future discussions on international wheat trade should
include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.
have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
two organizations said 
    While the Australian proposals are welcome the two
organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
assessments.
    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target
prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to
place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.
farmers, they said.
      Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted
from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.
acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim
Miller, president of NAWG said.
    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the
world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and
restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said.

<DATELINE>    EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gelco Corp said that,
excluding the effects of a restructuring plan, it expects
pre-tax operating earnings for the year to end July 31, 1987,
to be about the same as those of last year.
    For the year ended July 31, 1986, Gelco reported pre-tax
operating earnings of 14.8 mln dlrs, or 1.08 dlrs a share.
    However, final results will be affected by certain charges
including legal and investment advisors fees, preferred stock
dividends and other costs of restructuring, it said.
    Expenses associated with restructuring are expected to be
offset by "significant" gains from the sale of some of Gelco's
business units, it said.
    The final outcome for the fiscal year will be determined by
the timing and proceeds from the sale, it added.

<TITLE>PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New york, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he
has had discussions with several American Medical International
Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
company.
    Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
takeover bid for American Medical with several large
shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family
of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support
one way or the other for his offer, he said.
    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the
conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is
support for his offer.
    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,
the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical
stock.
    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical
management and other American Medical shareholders.
    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American
Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and
appropriate at this time."
    "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of
shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.
    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his
takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in
an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not
rule out a future takeover try.
    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
with the Bass family.
    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's
takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's
previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
Pesch.
    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.
Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a
management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
    An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment
on the new Pesch offer by March 10.
    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in
the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.
    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American
Medical, and the company has previously said the investors
support management's internal plan to improve the company's
performance. The Bass family would not comment on American
Medical or Pesch.
    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp
last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall
Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic
acquisition.
    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
much larger American Medical takeover proposal.
    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without
an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall
Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with
representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities
and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.
    "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
environment," Pesch said.
    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in
acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American
Medical management in place.
    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to
form an efficient network of hospitals.
    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
be made for American Medical.
    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second
fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth
about 20 dlrs per share.
    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second
quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
loss last year.
    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
could be completed because of the revised structure of the
offer. "I think it's much more doable," he said.
    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround
by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

<TITLE>THREE CONVICTED IN HOME STATE FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CINCINNATI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Marvin Warner and two fellow officers
of the former Home State Savings Bank were convicted on charges
connected with the collapse of Home State.
    Warner, the owner of Home State, was found guilty of six
counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home
State money without authorization from the board of directors
-- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985
collapse. He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful
misapplication.
    Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted
of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a
former president, was convicted on three of four counts of
securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of
willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction
    The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a
state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan
companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as
the firms were able to show proof of their solvency.
    Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court
ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a
1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel
pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30.
    Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and
Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said
that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his
convictions.
    All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of
Home State funds through investments with ESM Government
Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt
and triggered the collapse of Home State.
    On March 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all
of the state's privately-insured savings and loan companies and
they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit
insurance or merge with other companies which had federal
deposit insurance.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Efforts to break an impasse between
coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the
world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to
have failed, senior delegates said after a contact group
meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) Jorio
Dauster told Reuters after the contact group meeting there had
been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate
market shares rather than negotiate them.
    Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations
at a later date.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."
The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and
European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in
Washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West
Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with
governments.
    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and
Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.
The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.
    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country'rate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR PUROLATOR&lt;PCC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Several analysts said they do not
believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for
Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
group from Purolator's courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A former stock broker and an investor
who pleaded guilty last June to insider trading as a
participant in the scheme that involved lawyer Michael David
were sentenced by the Manhattan federal court today.
    Morton Shapiro, who was employed as a broker at Moseley
Hallgarten Stabrook and Weeden Inc, drew a two month jail
sentence and a 25,000 dlr fine.
    Daniel J. Silverman, who pleaded guilty to securities
fraud, was sentenced to three years probation, a 25,000 dlr
fine, and ordered to provide 250 hours of community service.
    As a result of trading on information supplied by David,
while he was at the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison, the defendants gained about 160,000 dlrs in their
insider trading scheme, according to U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani.
    The prosecutor also said Shapiro attempted to conceal his
unlawful trading by lying in testimony before the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

it will introduce exchanges for physicals (EFPS) to its energy
futures markets April one.
    An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil
traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after
the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be
hedged in the futures market.
    EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are
expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S.
energy futures, according to traders and analysts.
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

United States and the Virgin Islands have signed a tax treaty
to exchange tax information and provide mutual assistance in
tax matters.
    The agreement was needed to trigger provisions of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 allowing the Virgin Islands to offer
investment incentives by reducing Virgin Islands taxes on
non-U.S. source income, the Treasury said.
    The treaty will be a model for similar agreements to be
negotiated with three other U.S. possessions -- American Samoa,
the Mariana Islands and Guam, the Treasury said.
    The new agreement, which expands and replaces a prior
agreement with the Virgin Islands, was signed on February 24,
the Treasury said.

<TITLE>KIDDER UNIT SELLS CMOS, INCLUDING FLOATERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust
Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln
dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes,
including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.
    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate
class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset
quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11
pct cap.
    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a
so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture
possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.
    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during
the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the
11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,
the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did
not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.
    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.
    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has
an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60
basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This
tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer
said.
    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an
initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly
according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of
1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.
    Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the
500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160
basis points over comparable Treasuries.
    The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 -</DATELINE><BODY>The New York Mercantile Exchange expects
to submit a propane futures contract for federal regulatory
approval within a few days, according to an exchange
spokeswoman.
    As previously announced, the Board of Governors of the
exchange approved the contract last month. The exchange will
now submit the contract to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, according to the spokeswoman.
    Contract specifications will resemble those of heating oil
and gasoline futures. The contract size will be 1,000 barrels,
or 42,000 U.S. gallons.
    The minimum price fluctuation for the propane futures
contract will be  0.01 cent per gallon, or 4.20 dlrs a barrel,
according to the exchange.
    The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on
all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last
business day of the month preceding the delivery month.
    The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller's
pipeline, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu,
Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern
Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.
    Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer,
inter-facility transfer or pumpover, or book transfer and
cannot be done earlier than the tenth calendar day of the
delivery month, according to the exchange. Deliveries must be
completed no later than two business days prior to the end of
the delivery month.
    Buyers taking delivery of the propane must pay the seller
by certified check and the deadline for payment is 1200 EST
(noon) of the second business day following receipt of the
propane.

<TITLE>YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of
Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another
major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.
    In a statement issued by the trade representative's office
following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board
of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe
impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion
dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.
    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its
(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to
vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to
the European market," Yeutter said.
    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate
EC obligations under the GATT.
    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price
of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine
made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,
and closer in price to expensive European butter.
    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such
a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved
the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to
include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.
    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational
course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are
beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global
trade talks)," he said.

<TITLE>GREECE SAYS IT HAS RIGHT ON AEGEAN OIL DRILLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey
against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today
it had the right to decide where and how to do research or
drilling work in the area.
    A government spokesman said the Greek position was made
clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.
    Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today
Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976
Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean
continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.
    The Greek statement today said, "Greece is not prepared to
give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed.
It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or
how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government."
    "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side
know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive
through the fault of Turkey," it said.
    The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the
continental shelf issue before international courts.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leucadia National Corp said two of
its subsidiaries have acquired a 7.2 pct stake in Minstar Inc,
a corporation controlled by corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and
used by him in his forays to acquire stock in companies.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Leucadia said its LNC Investments Inc, a Newark, Del.,
investment firm, and Charter National Life Insurance Co, a St.
Louis joint stock life insurance company, bought their combined
1,261,000 Minstar common shares for investment purposes only.
    The Leucadia subsidiaries had held an 11.0 pct stake in
Minstar, but cut to 1.8 pct, or 313,200 shares, last July.
    Since July, Leucadia said its companies have bought 947,800
Minstar common shares for a total of 24.7 mln dlrs.
    Leucadia said it bought the Minstar stake to obtain an
equity position in the company and has no intention of seeking
control of it.
    Nearly half of Leucadia's common stock is owned by TLC
Associates, a Salt Lake City, Utah, general partnership, whose
partners include the chairman and president of Leucadia and
other investors.

    Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the
issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often
heated talks, delegates said.
    Export quotas -- the major device of the International
Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year
ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in
Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.
    Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee
prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year
lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>French industry is failing to produce the
goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left
the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the
economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct
this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb
to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9
pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.
    The report said the French economy was "increasingly
ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative
prices on both domestic and export markets."
    "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical
bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...
And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18
months," it said.
    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit
to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,
it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the
franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness
relative not only to the United States but also to the newly
industrialised countries."
    This could result in further major losses of market share,
particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a
quarter of French exports, it said.
    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the
authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic
manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to
encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow
more briskly," it added.
    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage
demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a
two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.
    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no
account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct
surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the
government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.
    "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke
runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has
been lost," one OECD official commented.
    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil
prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the
report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast
to around 2.5 or three pct.
    The government last week revised its forecast up to between
2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.
    But the OECD backed the government's view that the
underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,
with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's
fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of
disinflation.
    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in
the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and
its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one
pct this year, it said.
    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for
industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply
as companies built up their profits.
    "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price
competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange
rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"
it said.

<TITLE>SEC PROBES 1986 TRE &lt;TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
laws.
    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
dlr bond offering.
    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
been interviewed by the SEC probers.
    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
and had heard nothing more since that time.
    "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid,
he said.
    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
    "We had nothing to do with TRE."
    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to
comment on its enforcement activities.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

<TITLE>USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain trade representatives continued
to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer
subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture
Department officials said there was no substance to the
reports.
    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA's
Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the
administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow
in the next two to three weeks.
    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not
to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the
speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the
(wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the
basis of the speculation.
    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan
administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain
trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as
much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before
mid-year, if it was "competitively priced."
    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading
organization, told Reuters he had no information to
substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but
said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was
competitively priced.
    "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are
looking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the
administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they
should find ways to do it."

to go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks in
wages and benefits asked for by their employers, Seafarers'
International Union official Roman Gralewicz said.
    "It's 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewicz
said in an interview.
    The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes
and Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in
January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help
settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of
March.
    The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction in
crew levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400
jobs.

<TITLE>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING DOWN THREE PCT IN JAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Contracting for future construction
work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of
236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.
    The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding
construction was largely responsible for the month's setback
from December's higher level.
    Residential building eased three pct in January, while
contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional
buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.
    Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized
rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only
major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to
43.1 billion.
    Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction
advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for
1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after
the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending
authority.
    Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an
annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional
structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the
reason for the gain, the report said.
    Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in
January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally
adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be
strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage
rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as
a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

    Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers over
successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food
production appeared to be gathering strength.
    In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of
Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a
better deal from Brussels.
    The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets
and occupied local government buildings while in the southern
city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons
on the streets in protest at EC duties.
    Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry West
German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning
effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France
pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices.
    Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the
European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit
farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public
stores at high guaranteed EC prices.
    In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review,
at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, Agriculture
Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could
result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct.
    The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform
surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political
embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and
threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas.
    Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a
decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and
to slash beef prices by around 10 pct.
    That decision, agreed in outline last December after
virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the
most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has
since run into difficulties over the fine print.
    West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules
governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the
Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has
been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package.
    Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and
resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before
starting the price review which is confidently predicted to
last many months.
    EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an
overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost
entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this
year of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    SAN MATAO, Calif., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Calny Inc said it has filed a
multi-million-dlr suit against PepsiCo Inc and its La Petite
Boulangerie unit.
    Calny, which holds 15 La Petite Boulangerie franchises,
alleges it and PepsiCo breached their agreements with Calny by
failing to support the franchises in a number of ways.
    The company further alleges that PepsiCo and La Petite
Boulangerie had fiduciary responsibilities to Calny because of
the longstanding relationship between Calny and Taco Bell, also
a PepsiCo subsidiary. Calny operates 143 Taco Bell restaurants.
    Calny said Pepsico misrepresented the readiness of the La
Petite Boulangerie to expand outside San Francisco and
misrepresented costs involved in operating the restaurants.

<TITLE>JAPAN UNEMPLOYMNENT RISES TO RECORD IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the
Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its
current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in
December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
said.
    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,
up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.
    Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
the second-worst level set last December. Record male
unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
    Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal
to the record level marked in April, August, September and
December last year.
    January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed
from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in
export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation
against the dollar, officials said.
    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a
year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the
textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06
mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders,
down 170,000.

    "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability
of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government
is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of
the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.
    Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up
further because this might spark off inflation and depress the
U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.
    The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opec remains within its agreed output
ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current
fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian
Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that
present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of
warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for
oil.
    Prices had also been forced down because refineries were
using up old stock, he said.
    He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production
ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:
"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.
    He said there appeared to have been some attempts to
manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the
cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through
present price difficulties.
    He predicted that prices would recover again in the third
and fourth quarters of 1987.
    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency
Opec meeting.
    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the
spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and
predict the price will be better in the third and fourth
quarters."
    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock
deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price
to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members
stuck together.

<TITLE>OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government's industry aid and
protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission
(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat
industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.
    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance
to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,
he said in a statement.
    He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting
marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the
underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing
Act expire.
    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full
examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.
    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes
which have taken place in the industry as a result of the
agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and
the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"
he said.
    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,
as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger
underwriting support from the government for the first time," he
said.
    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the
guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian
Wheat Board near the start of the season.
    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the
findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,
Handling and Transport, Kerin said.
    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its
findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in
later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the
federal and state governments and the industry.

<TITLE>COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The failure of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas
could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at
least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.
    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80
cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.
    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss
quotas was set, delegates said.
    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the
International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after
prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.
    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer
selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee
roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.
    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket
shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.
    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and
exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the
breakdown of the talks.
    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and
delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council
adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not
prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective
criteria.
    "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas
based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their
political influence in the ICO."
    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster
countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to
dictate quotas, not negotiate them."
    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts
exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market
of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted
quotas to continue under this basic scheme.
    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers
proposed carving up the export market on the basis of
exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's
share to 28.8 pct.
    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes
in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more
readily available to consumers when they need it.
    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest
exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim
proposal could not bring the two sides together.
    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,
illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on
bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to
protect its coffee export earnings.
    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily
on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and
Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure
to agree quotas, analysts said.
    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as
much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates
forecast.
    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full
council is not due to meet again until September, delegates
said.

    Diplomats said member states were unable to settle

original arms sales to Iran and 35 pct thought he was telling
the truth.
    The poll found 42 pct of those surveyed approved Reagan's

<TITLE>EARTHQUAKES CONTINUE TO SHAKE NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Earthquakes and aftershocks are still
shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's
strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.
    Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale
have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east
since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).
    No casualties have been reported and no further major
damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were
treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock.
    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North
Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
    Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the
seismologist added.
    A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared
yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access
to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the forestry
town of Kawerau severely restricted.
    Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale.
    The seismologist said if the pattern of other large
earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to
several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the
chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.
    Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides
in the area are being cleared, with power and water restored to
most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being
repaired.
    Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before
flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference
of foreign ministers.
    A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist
civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources
said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when
the buildings are declared safe.

<TITLE>JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese investor interest in British
gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations
sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and
on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.
    Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been
expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors
seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which
have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.
    Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has
been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office
of a British securities firm said.
    On the other hand, major long-term investors such as
Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about
buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the
Japanese financial year, traders said.
    These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through
dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying
in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British
securities house said.
    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from
234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of
230 to 234 late last year.
    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will
further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from
further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.
    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,
suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand
from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager
Machiko Suzuki.
    She said she expected the yield on the actively traded
11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against
9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.
    The economists said the service sector should grow as the
government stimulates domestic demand under its program to
transform the economy away from exports.
    Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than
those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating
statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.
    "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively
high figure if European methods were used," one economist said.
More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a
year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's
Tsukihara said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKER PLEA ON EXCHANGE RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing
orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Textile Federation said.
    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
associations last Saturday the government could not fix the
Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to
U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold
the exchange rate at that level.
    The federation said in its request that many local textile
exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
business if the rate continued to fall.
    It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against
the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won
climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars
remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said.
    Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar
will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.
    Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's
ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.
    The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.
    Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January
to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the same
figures show.
    Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner, after
electrical and electronic products.
    Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year
from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were
worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs.

<DATELINE>    CAIRO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Egypt allowed five fugitive Libyan
soldiers who landed in a military plane in the far south of the
country last night to stay and flew them to Cairo, official
sources said.
    It appeared the government had agreed to demands by the
five -- two officers and three privates -- for political asylum
but there was no immediate announcement.
    Official sources said Egyptian servicemen flew the Libyans
north from Abu Simbel in their C-130 transport plane. The
status of the sixth Libyan on board, the pilot, was not
immediately known.

<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.

<TITLE>JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip
exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a
U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese
chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
    A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
authorised exporters.
    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be
required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
not automatically be denied licences, he said.
    But some industry officials predicted any government
measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
world semiconductor market remained weak.
    U.S. Government and industry officials have complained
repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
cost to third countries despite the July agreement.
    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs
and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
    The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market
is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
distributing their products through their sales network knowing
they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask
them what they are doing to reduce the figure."
    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long
as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market
prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to
make money," a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said.

<TITLE>BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's improving economy will likely
cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion
dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at
end-February, private bankers said.
    Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to
3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.
    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank
Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively
high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,
and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,
contributed to the projected sharp rise.
    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to
expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.
    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could
achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up
from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.
    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its
current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable
the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.
    Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,
special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target
is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Singapore's Finance Minister Richard
Hu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no
major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1,
bankers and economists told Reuters.
    They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in
calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct
shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course
and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work.
    Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct,
and income tax was reduced by the same margin.
    Last year the government also reduced wage costs by
introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to
the mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund
(CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.
    "I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the
economy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice president
of the Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued
last week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting
measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986.
    But the report said over half the economy -- especially the
commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued
to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional
economies and an excess of domestic property.
    The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery
suggested the government would not introduce much of its
planned consumption tax in the coming financial year.
    In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up
collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign
against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to
levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use.
    The sources said the government does not look likely to
raise more revenue in this year's budget.
    Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget
deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected
an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion.
    Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income
and stringent controls on government operating expenditure,
helped by the wage-freeze policy.
    Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general manager
of American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing exciting
from this year's budget.
    Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of the
tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already
started moving so it does not need government support."
    Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline
in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in
private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from
the budget, economists said.
    The economic report said the sector's activity declined by
25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985.
A further decline is expected in 1987.
    But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for
industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until
the end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is add
incentives for creating property investment unit trusts.
    The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are
incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives
to families who have three children.
    Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced
the government will try to encourage three-child families,
instead of the two-child families it encourages now.

<TITLE>FISONS SEES STRONG INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said strong
international growth had been the main feature of the group's
1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50
pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.
    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a
larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of
its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw
pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.
The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares
nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from
643p.
    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as
well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly
indicated by a strong 1986 performance.
    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion
of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its
ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations
had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash
flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full
programme of capital investment.
    Action to protect the group against foreign currency
movements resulted in a small net gain to profits.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines must devalue the peso if
it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning
Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.
    "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports
more competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question about
it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South
Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies
deliberately undervalued their currencies."
    The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is
currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does
not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and
able to continue to respond to market conditions.
    Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from
the point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher,
our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the
financing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at it
in terms of the economy."
    She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.
    "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to
become uncompetitive because then we are dead."
    Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is
a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)
of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic
thing."
    Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct
in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was
expected to touch five pct this year.
    He said the government and the International Monetary Fund
had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.
    The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the
dollar when it was floated in 1984.

<TITLE>ZAIRE ACCEPTS TIN-EXPORT QUOTA, ATPC SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zaire agreed to limit its tin
exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with
an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb
exports, the ATPC said.
    ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he
received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take
part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes
for a year from March 1.
    Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of
tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports
were about 1,200 tonnes.
    The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by
20,000 tonnes and boost prices.
    All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed
to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan.
Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to
its expected output this year.
    The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand,
Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire.
    China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not
members.

<TITLE>JAPANESE FINANCIAL FUTURES PLAN REVEALED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federation of Bankers' Associations of
Japan released its proposal for early creation of a
comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.
    The market should include a comprehensive range of futures
and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global
money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is
available, the proposal said.
    It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and
incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock
index futures contracts.
    The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must
be conducted on the same market so participants can readily
engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.
    To make this possible, the proposal calls for new
legislation which would administer all related futures and
options transactions under the same legal framework.
    Banking sources said they expect that initially the
currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would
include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,
three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury
bonds.
    Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as
saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible
because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's
financial markets.
    Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective
market participants to banks but was willing to accept those
from wider business circles, the sources said.
    Japan's only current financial futures market, in yen
bonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985.
    But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading
in a basket of leading stocks in April.

former currency clerk of Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> with
misappropriating 8,300 dlrs in July in an alleged
foreign-exchange fraud.
    A spokeswoman for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs
Commission (CAC) said the arrest was part of its investigation
stemming from complaints from Westpac and &lt;Kleinwort Benson
Australia Ltd>.
    CAC and Westpac officials said they were working out how
much money was involved, but said press reports it was as much
as five mln dlrs were probably exaggerated.
    Police told reporters it was alleged the former clerk
quoted an incorrect dealing price relationship between the yen
and the Swiss franc.
    They said the CAC was investigating 14 other cases
involving 214,000 dlrs.
    A Kleinwort Benson spokesman declined to comment on the
case but the company said in a statement yesterday a small loss
incurred in 1986 in its foreign-exchange division was unrelated
to "certain alleged forex irregularities."

<TITLE>JAPAN LIKELY TO LET U.S. BANKS DEAL SECURITIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks to
conduct securities business here, a move that will probably
cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from
brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.
    But the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to
conflicting domestic interests.
    J.P.Morgan and Co &lt;JPM>, Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT>,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Chemical Bank New York
Corp &lt;CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities
business in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.
    "There is no reason for extended delay of approval," one
official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been
seeking finance ministry approval for months.
    To date, Japan has allowed European banks to do securities
business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese
banks can conduct securities business in European countries,
this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for
Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market.
    But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will press
hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct
securities business in the U.S.
    Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be
approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the
decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the
finance ministry declined comment.
    U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on
financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months.
Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April
or June.
    At the last round of financial negotiations in September,
U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was
flagging.
    Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously
considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve
Bank of New York approved five new primary government
securities dealers, including two Japanese brokerages, last
December.
    They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S.
Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open
to foreigners as those of the U.S.
    Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial
deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear
division between the securities and banking businesses.
    Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to
protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are
finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional
fields.
    Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay
special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank
requests because approval would accelerate market
liberalization in Japan.
    The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for
their own entry into the domestic securities market.

<TITLE>CURRENCY SECTORS CONTINUE TO FEATURE EUROBOND TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Early dollar straight eurobond trade was
quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling,
continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current
trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.
    Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by
the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market
on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.
    The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight
bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed
signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting
today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January.
    The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be
weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing
the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading
impetus, one dollar straight trader said.
    "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how
anybody is going to make any money," he said.
    Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of
general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at
six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of
the domestic equity markets.
    Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.
    However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could
soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals
stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.
    Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued
today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.
    There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting
trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started
the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week.
    FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian --
banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press
reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.
    "(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to
Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis
after things had more or less quietened down following the
first shock statements last week," one FRN specialist said.
    Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight
secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early
features on the primary market.
    These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan
Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4
pct.
    The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 --
for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.
    Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due
mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlr&#127;untied loan from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum
Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.
    No further details on the loan were immediately available.
    Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion
in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in
the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.
    The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on
the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and
construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.
    The project also includes construction of liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional
crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia
complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion
of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.
    Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and
materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will
enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz
rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some
LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan
diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.

<TITLE>COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its return
to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium
prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and
greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of
proposed dividend imputation laws.
    This would make five cents for the year against a first and
final of one cent in 1985.
    Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer
from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian
dollar had helped earnings.
    Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint
venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand
Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo
Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases
in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.
    As previously reported Comalco's &lt;Commonwealth Aluminium
Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at
Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon
to &lt;Columbia Aluminium Corp>.
    Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary
provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if
the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the
provision made in the 1986 accounts.
    The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5
mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange
losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.

<TITLE>CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ME}LBOURNE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to
pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
after July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.
    The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.
    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free
to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.
    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.
    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor
year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
gold producers.
    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars
declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.
    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have
steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
but overcapacity continues, CRA said.
    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said
Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs
while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.
    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs
against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.
    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in
1985, CRA said.
    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
from 2.8 mln.
    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for
closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in
future tax provisions, CRA said.
    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The
strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.
    CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985
mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0
mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.

<TITLE>CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
     The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added
     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
     The paper also printed a table showing that, since
bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be
dominated or controlled by international Communism."
     The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
them.
     China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
which the U.S. Side won, he said.
     But, for the first time, China signed last week an
agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
     Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
     "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.
     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
China's interest in participating in GATT.
     "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.
     "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
benefit from its GATT participation," he said.
     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance
planning" and economic levers.
     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
do.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
    Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
yesterday.

<TITLE>TAIWAN BANKS ASKED TO TAKE PART IN INDONESIA LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, Mar 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd of Hong Kong has
approached Taiwan banks to take part in a syndicated loan of
300 mln U.S. Dlrs to finance a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
project in Indonesia, local banking sources said.
    The project calls for construction of a 400 mln U.S. Dlr
facility which could produce two mln tonnes of LNG for supply
by Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp .
    This was the first time Taiwanese banks, including the Bank
of Taiwan and Bank of Communications, were invited to form a
syndicated loan, they added.
    Pertamina has initialled a 20-year contract with Chinese
Petroleum Corp &lt;CPC> for the supply of 1.5 mln tonnes of LNG
for Taiwan starting October 1989, a CPC official said.
    CPC is building an LNG receiving terminal in southern
Taiwan city of Kaohsiung at a cost of 820 mln U.S. Dlrs. The
terminal will be completed in mid-1989.
    A Taiwanese banker said"It will be a good idea for our banks
to take part in the loan if we want to start in the
international lending market."

has signed a one billion dlr contract to sell 10 A320
short-haul jets to &lt;All Nippon Airways> of Japan, with an

    The spokesman declined to comment on a New York Times

    But industry sources said American was about to announce
the purchase of 25 wide-bodied planes from Airbus, as well as
15 747s from Boeing Co &lt;BAN>.
    Airbus has already signed large deals with Pan Am Corp

    The A320 made its first flight on February 22 and is not

    The All Nippon purchase brings the total number of

- Zimbabwe's maize crop in 1986/87 (April/ March) is likely to
be slightly over 1.6 mln tonnes, against 1.83 mln in 1985/86,
Grain Marketing Board figures show.
    Maize exports for 1986/87 to January 31, 1987 totalled
315,000 tonnes, with about a further 40,000 tonnes expected to

rains. Last year's consumption was around 700,000 tonnes.

<TITLE>U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
swap.
    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
today.
    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,
said that the government does not want sterling either to rise
too far or to fall substantially from current levels.
    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.

<TITLE>COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELP RETURN TO PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comalco Ltd said its return to profit
reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and
its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and
greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of
proposed dividend imputation laws.
    This would make five cents for the year against a first and
final of one cent in 1985.
    Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer
from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian
dollar had helped earnings.
    Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it
has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in
Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia
Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of
27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be
reduced if the sales agreement were completed.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
    Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
yesterday.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKS SEEK GREATER BRAZIL LINK WITH IMF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Anthony Williams, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German banks would like Brazil to work
more closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a
view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems,
senior West German banking sources said.
    The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today
between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West
german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazil
should come up with a convincing economic recovery program.
    Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.
    Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve
governments in negotiations with commercial banks on
rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some
109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve
its problems with the banks rather than governments.
    Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early
tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this
evening.
    Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the
IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an
austerity program with the Fund.
    However, the West German banking sources said institutions
here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a
credible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement"
with the IMF.
    "Consultations are the least that can be expected," said one
banker.
    Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to
suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial
debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by
foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.
    One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt
negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro
for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of
banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.
    Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct of
Brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory
committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil
might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,
involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since European
banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative
debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.
    The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional
approach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution."
But he added: "There must be an understanding that special
requests from special regions be taken into account."
    German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of
interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It
was imperative that alternative options be considered. "The menu
must become richer," the banker said.
    Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved
in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in
Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.
    West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the
Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in
the United States, because of their lower exposure.
    According to Bundesbank data from September last year, West
German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16
billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign
credit.

<TITLE>AQUINO ANNOUNCES LAND REFORM PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Corazon Aquino announced
government plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24
billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the
sale of failed businesses taken over by the government.
    Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugar
estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform
programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.
    "Whatever laws will be enacted, I say that nobody is above
the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are
Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are
enacted as far as sugar land is concerned," she told reporters.
    A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan,
including the question of whether land operated by
multinational companies should also be covered, she added.
    Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently
the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land
to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform
programme.
    The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also covers
sugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, he
said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless
peasants, he added.
    Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break
up her family's 6,000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her
sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of
the most pressing problems facing the Philippines.
    It was not known whether government would wait for the
Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or
have Aquino carry it out through an executive order.
    Under the plan, government will purchase land mainly from
landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include
vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50,000 hectares
seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand
Marcos.

<TITLE>OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opec remains within its agreed output
ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current
fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian
Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that
present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of
warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for
oil.
    Prices had also been forced down because refineries were
using up old stock, he said.
    He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production
ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:
"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.
    He said there appeared to have been some attempts to
manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the
cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through
present price difficulties.
    He predicted that prices would recover again in the third
and fourth quarters of 1987.
    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency
Opec meeting.
    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the
spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and
predict the price will be better in the third and fourth
quarters."
    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock
deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price
to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members
stuck together.

<TITLE>JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.

    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile

    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold

<TITLE>JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese investor interest in British
gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations
sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and
on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.
    Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been
expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors
seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which
have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.
    Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has
been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office
of a British securities firm said.
    On the other hand, major long-term investors such as
Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about
buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the
Japanese financial year, traders said.
    These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through
dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying
in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British
securities house said.
    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from
234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of
230 to 234 late last year.
    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will
further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from
further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.
    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,
suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand
from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager
Machiko Suzuki.
    She said she expected the yield on the actively traded
11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against
9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London.

<TITLE>DAIMLER OUTPUT COULD BE AFFECTED BY DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STUTTGART, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car
production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable
future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the
firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.
    A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's
Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for
Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the
beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the
state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ
more workers.
    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the
Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other
plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.
    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which
is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not think
Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on
overtime by its own works councils.
    A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed
down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union
sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later
settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.
    The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was
currently around 2,500 a day.

<TITLE>HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The price of Hongkong and Shanghai
Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
brokers said.
    They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
    Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
from Liang as long term investment.
    He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of
Hk Hotels."
    Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
Hk Hotels.
    &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
    Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
    "It is purely coincidence," he said.
    But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
    Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
    Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
the Hk Hotels board.
    A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
not considered any countermoves so far.
    Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
styles.
    "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked
not to be named.
    Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
current trading price.
    Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
Ltd>.
    Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

    The poll found 42 pct of those surveyed approved Reagan's
handling of his job and 46 pct disapproved. The approval rating
was the lowest since January 1983, when 41 pct approved of the
way Reagan was doing his job.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CUTS WAGE BOOSTS FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp has changed its
method of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is
reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the
total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, a
company spokesman said.
    He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the
calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum
payments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be included
in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change
affects about 109,000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada.
                                       
    GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for
salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. As
a result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the base
pay rates of salaried employees.
    The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain
cost-competitive with other U.S. automakers.
    GM is currently in thje midst of a program to cut
employment of salaried workers by 25 pct.

<DATELINE>    ADA, Okla., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc said it
has signed a letter of intent under which it would receive
financing from I.C.H. Corp.
    The company said under the proposed transaction I.C.H.
would loan it up to 100 mln dlrs, and the loan balance would be
convertible at any time by either party into Pre-Paid common
stock at 11 dlrs per share.  In addition, it said it would
grant I.C.H. a five-year option to purchase new shares at the
same price.  It said the option would enable I.C.H. to acquire
up to 500 pct plus one share of Pre-Paid common.
    Pre-Paid said until expiration of the option, and as long
as Pre-Paid maintained a mutually agreeable combined loss and
expense ratio, I.C.H. would, on Pre-Paid's request, exercise as
much of the option as may be necessary to meet Pre-Paid's
funding needs.
    The company said I.C.H. has requested the right to buy
90,909 Pre-Paid shares from Pre-Paid chairman Harland C.
Stoneciphjer for 11 dlrs each.  Stonecipher now owns or has the
right to acquire 1,965,269 Pre-Paid shares and will agree to
restrictions on the sale of his remaining shares, it said. The
company saiod Stonecipher will remain chairman.
    Pre-Paid said the transactions are subject to approval by
boards of both comnpanies and regulatory agencies.

<TITLE>NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Employers and the port union, FNV, are
to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the
six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but
neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told
Reuters.
    Little progress was made in last night's three hours of
talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.
    "There is still a very large gap between the employers and
the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.
But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.
    Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused
the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all
over the past two months.
    "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am
really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at
all."
    "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to
accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector,
then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin
later this month," Schoufour said.
    The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them
more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the
past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800
redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with
350 this year.
    Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said
unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw
the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.
    Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out
their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from
him before Wednesday at the earliest.

company spokesman said.
    He would not comment on the subject of the press
conference, or would he confirm published reports that AMR will
today announce a 2.5 billion dlr purchase of aircraft and
engines.
    According to a New York Times report, AMR is expected to

&lt;Airbus Industrie> and 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> 767's and the choice
of General Electric Co &lt;GE> to supply all 80 engines for the
craft.  The engine order alone, for 80 CF80C-2's, would be
worth about 500 mln dlrs.
    The Airbus plane order would be worth about 1.25 billion
dlrs and the Boeing order about 750 mln dlrs, according to the
report.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.A> group saw
improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the
Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.
    Very good progress was made last year, while the recent
acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> was a significant
addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to
come.
    Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax
profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period,
making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full
year.
    Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to
the more conventional practice of depreciating assets
individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average
rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the
accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the
net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at
January 1, 1987.
    Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in
buoyant response to the results and share split proposal,
though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers
added.

<TITLE>U.S. LEADING INDEX FELL 1.0 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. index of leading indicators
fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised
2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
December.
    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
plant and equipment.
    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
contributed to the decline.
    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
state unemployment insurance.
    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
prices, new business formation, average work week and money
supply.
    The main factor for the December upward revision was new
business formation.
    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the
leading indicators index for November.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7
pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.
    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of
0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.

<TITLE>COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>This morning's sharp decline in coffee
prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations
in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization,
ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.
    "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the
failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it
will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices
rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters
said.
    "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee
available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.
    "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the
news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to
around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.
    Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries
said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of
consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota
reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be
reallocated on a more equitable basis.
    "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because
the market is well balanced and we must not lose this
opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.
    "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of
clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not
welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete
renegotiation," de Vries added.
    With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have
fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the
foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a
hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices
were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> TO ACQUIRE 40 LONG-RANGE JET AIRCRAFT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp's American Airlines said it
will buy 40 long-range jet aircraft to support international
expansion, including routes in the Caribbean.
    Under one agreement, the airline said, it will acquire 15
Boeing Co &lt;BA> 767-300 planes. Under a separate agreement,
American will acquire A-300-600 aircraft from &lt;Airbus
Industrie>, a European consortium.
    The company's announcement included no value for the order.
    Published reports put the value of the aircraft order,
including engines, at 2.5 billion dlrs.
    A total of 98 General Electric Co &lt;GE> CF6-80C2 engines is
involved in the orders, American Airlines said.
    The published reports valued the engines at five mln dlrs
each.
    The company said it will acquire the planes and engines
using rental leases that can be terminated on relatively short
notice.
    The arrangement allows the airline to acquire the planes
without adding to its debt, it explained.
    The Boeing 767s, to be delivered from February 1988 to
October 1988, will be used on routes between the U.S. and
Europe, American said.
    It said the Airbus A300s, scheduled for delivery from April
1988 through June 1989, will be assigned to the Caribbean,
where American has developed a major new hub at San Juan,
Puerto Rico.

<TITLE>HEINZ INTERESTED IN BUYING GUINNESS BREWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUBLIN, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.J. Heinz &lt;HNZ.N> chairman Tony O'Reilly
would be interested in buying Guinness PLC &lt;GUIN.L>'s brewery
division if it were for sale, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,
said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the
brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together
a consortium, nor has he been buying shares."
    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as
saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that
he had the support of two international banks if he decided
such a purchase might be worthwhile.
    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing
profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,
the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.
    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for
the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he
said.
    "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,
but not impossible," he added.
    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and
Malaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as an
integral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said.

<TITLE>EQUATORIAL COMMUNICATIONS &lt;EQUA> TO HAVE LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Equatorial Communications
Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in December 1988.
    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
    Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

refining arm of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>, raised its
pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln
stg in calendar 1986, compared with 66 mln stg in 1985.
    Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from
4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost
operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln.
    BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional
items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges.
    Chief executive David Kendall said improved results
mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in
recent years.
    However, he warned future financial pressure on the
industry will be severe.
    "The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to
invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a
good many years," he said in a statement.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Earthquakes and aftershocks are still
shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's
strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.
    Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale
have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east
since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).
    No casualties have been reported and no further major
damage, civil defence sources said.
    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North
Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
    The seismologist said if the pattern of other large
earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to
several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the
chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.

<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.

<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing
orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Textile Federation said.
    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
associations last Saturday the government could not fix the
Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to
U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold
the exchange rate at that level.
    The federation said in its request that many local textile
exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
business if the rate continued to fall.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's state-owned &lt;Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro - BNL> said it would issue 120 mln dlrs of five-year
convertible eurobonds, an operation to be lead-managed by
&lt;Credit Suisse-First Boston Ltd>.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference that the
issue, to be placed on the main international markets and
listed in Luxembourg, would be the first equity linked issue by
an Italian bank on the Euromarket.
    BNL officials said the issue is scheduled for mid-March and
additional financial details were not immediately available.
    They said the operation would be through the issue of
depositary receipts by BNL's London branch. They said the bonds
would carry warrants issued by its &lt;Efibanca> subsidiary and
convertible into BNL saving shares within five years.
    The officials said a banking consortium led by Credit
Suisse-First Boston would at the same time arrange for the
private placing of an unspecified number of BNL savings shares
with foreign institutional investors.
    The operation was to further its aim of obtaining a listing
on foreign stock exchanges with a view to future capital
increases through ordinary share issues, they said.

has revised downward its previously reported fourth quarter and
year, ended October 31, results to reflect compensation expense

    The company said resolution of this disagreement with its

involvement. The company will amend its option-granting
procedure to conform to the SEC decision which will eliminate
future charges, it added.
    Transform said its fourth quarter profit was revised to
305,082 dlrs, or two cts a share, from the previously reported
580,955 dlrs, which left the company with a fiscal 1986 loss of
249,814 dlrs, or two cts a share, instead of the reported

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported
improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
&lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

    The investment includes the purchase of 360,537 newly

about 33 mln dlrs, it said. The loan is convertible into an
additional 229,463 DIM shares, it noted.
    The proposed agreement is subject to approval by the French
government, it said.

    The company said it plans to expand from 28 to 55 hotels in
its Asia/Pacific region and to 192 in its Europe/Middle
East/Africa regionby 1995.
    For 1987, the hotel group will focus on expansion on
Western Europe and Asia, citing China as an untapped source for
the international lodging industry.
    Holiday also said it will concentrate on city center hotels
in key destination cities in Western Europe, catering primarily
to business travelers.
    Some of those cities where Holiday said it will open new
properties this year include Amsterdam, Lyon/Atlas and Lisbon.

<TITLE>CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
    The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
    "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
    "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
    "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added.
    The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
    He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.

said after the release of a sharply lower January leading
indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed.
    "The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net
exports," he said in a statement after the department reported
the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest
drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984.
    The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct
December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for
plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods.

<TITLE>KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kenyan economy is heading for
difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
    In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
    The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
1985, he added.
    "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
reserves during the year," he said.
    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
capital for the first time in its history, he added.
    "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
sources to finance our development," he said.
    "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing
four information technology systems that will be led by today's
highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.
    The company said information management products will be
the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business
communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of
Kodak."
    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,
Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four
billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those
sales were independent, that company would rank among the top
100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.
    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications
campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's
commitment to the business and industrial sector.
    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the
information management systems unveilded today --
    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more
than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).
    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information
management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system
that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current
information management systems.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,
computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.
    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a
write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will
market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in
1988.
    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up
to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes
of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed
out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.
    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000
in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system 
allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,
including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,
fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to
sell in the 700,000 dlr range.
    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk
version which provides data storage and retrieval through a
disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing
2.6 gigabytes.
    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of
the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually
loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs
with deliveries beginning in mid-year.
    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with
the more powerful KIMS system 5000.
    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and
software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987
and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.

<TITLE>BANGOR HYDRO &lt;BANG> SEEKS RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGOR, Maine, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it
has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for
a two-stage base rate reduction.
    Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect
on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a
final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln
dlrs, or 9.7 pct.
    The company said lower federal income taxes and lower
capital costs prompted the filing.
    The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the
MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue
reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.
    Bangor Hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce
residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by April 1.
    The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its
fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1.
    Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset
much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some
customers' rates.

<TITLE>PHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast
earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
at their present parities.
    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
on currency movements.
    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
    The company said mainly this represented the premium the
group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
had taken over.
    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
having used more funds than generated by group operations,
mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares
in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular
Inc.

<TITLE>PROXMIRE VOWS QUICK ACTION ON U.S. BANKING BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Banking Committee Chairman
William Proxmire said modified legislation to help a federal
deposit insurance fund and prohibit new limited-service banks
and thrifts could be ready for a Senate vote in two to three
weeks.
    Proxmire said he agreed to demands from committee members
for a one-year moratorium on granting new business powers
sought by commercial banks to increase the bill's chances.
    In its new form, the bill would proscribe regulators from
granting new powers to banks, Proxmire told reporters after a
speech to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
    A vote on the bill by the committee is scheduled for
Thursday. If approved it will go to the full Senate.
    "I have spoken to the majority leader and he has agreed to
bring it up promptly on the Senate floor in two or three weeks,"
Proxmire told the thrift executives.
    The bill would recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp fund with 7.5 billion dlrs.
    It also would prohibit establishment of new nonbank banks
and nonthrift thrifts, so-called because they provide financial
services but do not meet the regulatory definition of both
making loans and receiving deposits.

denying industry speculation, said the company is not
interested in acquiring shuttle routes in the northeast region
of the U.S. from Pan Am Corp.
    But in remarks at a press conference announcing a major
aircraft order, he said AMR would be interested in certain
other Pan Am assets. But he noted that none had been made
available.
    Pan Am earlier today announced an order for 40 new aircraft
from Boeing Co &lt;BA> and &lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European
consortium, for an estimated 2.5 billion dlrs.
    AMR, the parent of American Airlines, has said it is not
interested in acquiring Pan Am as a whole and Crandall
reiterated that position today.
    "Assets are one thing, and companies are another," Crandall
said, referring to the possibility of acquiring assets from Pan
Am.
    He said Pan Am has not offered its transatlantic routes for
sale, adding that it would not make much sense for them to do
so.

part of its foreign expansion policy.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference the Italian
bank was currently involved in talks but declined to name the
German institution.
    He said the takeover move could be seen as BNL's reply to
Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>, which entered the Italian market in
December 1986, with the purchase of BankAmerica &lt;BACN>
subsidiary &lt;Banca D'America e D'Italia>.
    Nesi said BNL had also approved a 200 mln dlr credit line
to the Soviet Union aimed at enabling Soviet companies to pay
for Italian imports. He gave no further details.
    BNL officials said the group had also decided to increase
its activities in the Soviet Union by opening a representative
office in Moscow this month through its subsidiary &lt;Sogecred>,
which specialises in Italian-Soviet trade.

enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase
agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via
System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at

rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25
billion dlrs of five-year Treasury notes.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> HOPES FOR FIVE-FOLD RISE IN EUROPEAN SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Carmaker General Motors hopes to
sell between 7,000 and 8,000 vehicles in Europe this year, a
five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-president
of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation told a news briefing.
    "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he said at
a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.
    "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in
Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later.
Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year.
    Fry said that at an average price of 13,000 dlrs, his
projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln
and 104 mln dlrs in Europe.
    GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500
vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the
then strong dollar, Fry said.
    All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the
United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were
in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The collapse of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the
immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the
customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.
    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation
offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee
imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A
bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).
    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach
agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not
immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the
coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.
    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)
this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

<TITLE>FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES CURRENCY REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Treasury official C. Fred
Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace
the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had
not worked.
    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major
countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they
would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct
intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and
other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute
for International Economics, said in a statement to a House
Banking subcommittee.
    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has
occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should
produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this
year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100
billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he
said.

<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Syria has complained to the
United Nations that Israeli occupation authorities were
blocking the export of citrus fruit from the Gaza Strip to the
countries of the European Community, EC.
    In a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
published here today, Syrian U.N. charge d'affaires Abdul
Mou'men Al-Atassi said: "These measures threaten to create a
slump in citrus production, which constitutes the primary
source of income in the Gaza Strip....They are causing heavy
losses to farmers and all those working in the field of citrus
production and threaten to bring about economic disaster."
    The Syrian envoy said the Israel action was a violation of
the Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Charter and the "legitimacy of
the economic rights endorsed by the United Nations."
    The Gaza Strip, occupied by Egypt in the 1948 Arab-Israel
war, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>There was no evidence of winterkill
in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line
running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.
Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field
report.
    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of
delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall
because of dry conditions.
    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
last fall's late seeding, it said.
    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
report said.
    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage
under these conditions, they said.
    The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the
field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it
emerged from winter.

to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,
Statistics Canada said.

    The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to
2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter,
was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and
investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04
billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.
    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth
quarter of 1985.

a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter
quarter.

<TITLE>CONTINENTAL &lt;GIC> SEES 1987 NET UP FROM TAX LAW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Corp said the fresh start
provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to
1987 earnings per share.
    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln
dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.
    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the
fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening
tax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes
into earnings.
    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline
gradually over the next four years, during which time
Continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.
    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to
have a significant impact on earnings.

<TITLE>BELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the
European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats
and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United
States.
    De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration
officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference
there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and
oils used in the 12 EC countries.
    But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because
there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will
be a compromise."
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United
States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and
access to community markets.
    De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone
its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to
cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was
made toward resolving differences with the United States.
    U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and
the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.
    He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal
with another controversial health proposal that would forbid
the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the
United States.
    De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be
resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.
    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change
slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a
few months later by the hormone rule.

<TITLE>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Loans and advances from the Dutch
central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at
12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2,
the central bank weekly return showed.
    The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion
guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of
interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in
the form of tax payments to the state.
    Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the
public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival
or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.
    Current money market rates are at 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct for
call money against 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 a week ago, and between
5-5/16 and 5-9/16 pct against 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 for one to 12
month periods, dealers said.
    The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion
guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared
with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added.
    They expect the money market shortage to continue around 12
billion guilders this week.
    The weekly return showed total Dutch gold and currency
reserves rose 11.3 mln guilders to 56.0 billion guilders.

Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., called for caution in giving
savings associations forbearance in paying their debts as part
of a bill providing three billion dlrs in new capital for the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
    "We cannot let forbearance stretch to protect the
mismanaged or terminal cases that would serve to further drain
the FSLIC fund," St Germain said at the start of a hearing on
FSLIC legislation. "Forbearance must be designed to help the
well managed institution temporarily on hard times. It must not
be forgiveness for the speculators, the high flyers and the
fast buck artists."
    The use of forbearance for well-managed institutions was
endorsed at the hearing by Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner
L.L. Bowman, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and the Texas
Savings and Loan League.

its board approved plans to offer a stock option plan for its
cable television operators.
    The company said it will offer the options in exchange for
a commitment to operate the company's programs to a set number

five year extension option.
    If the operator agrees to the plan, they will receive
options to buy 10 dlrs worth of common stock for each cable

to run both programs, the company explained.
    The company said the option will vest over a five year
period at the rate of 20 pct per year.
    The company, which offered a similar program last year,
said the current one is directed for those who did not sign up
last year, and for new carriers of the company's home shopping
video shows.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The upcoming five-month deficiency
payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash
and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior
Agriculture Department official told Reuters.
    Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or
"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,
Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state
and county operations, said.
    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs
ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be
delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer
program, von Garlem said.
get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in
certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).
    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at
signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half
of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said
this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most
farmers got advance payments.
    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300
mln dlrs," he said.
    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had
resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "we
proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it."

<TITLE>FORD CANADA &lt;FC> PROFIT DOWN ON CHANGEOVER COST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OAKVILLE, Ontario, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd,
90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, said the earlier reported
decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover
costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant.
    Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter
results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product
program costs, partially offset by lower engine production.
    The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell
to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter
profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior
year.
    Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian
operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth
quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in
the prior year.
    Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from
its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in
1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to
18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of
4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985,
excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.
    Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent
company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion
dlrs.
    The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln
dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter
results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies,
cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were
partially offset by lower industry volumes.
    Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas
operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased
interest costs, the company said.
    Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share
of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said.
The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in
1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.
    Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car
and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were
Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986.

<TITLE>FIRESTONE &lt;FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has
notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its
Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire
plants on or before September 15.
    A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be
covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company
took in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    The company said it was notified by the union March one
that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City
tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other
plants. 
    Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of
its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers
for several months.
    Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding
it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to
work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of
the three tire plants, it added.
    Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants
in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being
designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master
agreement with the rubber workers.
    Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the
leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans
to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits
and work rules.
    Union procedures, however, require approval by the
Firestone section of the union's International Policy
Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master
contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.
    The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package
by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the
limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and
off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude
the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would
permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and
Bloomington plants.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct
of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr
foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.
    Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said
last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public
sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected
Venezuela's improved credit image.
    "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot
be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said.
    Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory
committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor
from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to
1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.
    "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a
marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this
year," Lusinchi said.
    He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the
Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to
reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case,
because of the vulnerability of its economy."
    Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in
February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of
falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year.
    Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to
sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter,
but that in any case it would become effective from April 1.
    Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been
contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public
Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to
round up support.
    Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised
were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the
outlines of a government plan to allow public and private
sector debt capitalisation.
    He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans
to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord.
    "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now
have to define more precisely what projects can be financed
from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel
and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to
materialise.

    The U.S. initiative was introduced last December at a

    The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second
biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to
improve statistics and market transparency of the copper
economy, and provide a forum for discussion.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
stabilise depressed world prices.
    This week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said it
estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.
    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>PANTERA &lt;PANT> AND PIZZA &lt;PZA> AGREE TO MERGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, MO., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pantera's Corp said it agreed in
principle to acquire Pizza Inn Inc in a cash and stock
transaction.
    Under terms of the proposed transaction, each Pizza Inn
share can be exchanged for either three dlrs in cash plus the
lesser of 1.4 shares of Pantera's common stock or 11.50 dlrs
market value of Pantera's stock, or four dlrs in cash plus a
unit consisting of one share of Pantera's stock and a
non-transferrable right to receive up to 0.55 share of
Pantera's stock under certain conditions, it said.
    Completion of the transaction is subject to arrangement of
financing, negotiation of a definitive agreement, and various
regulatory approvals, it said.
    Pantera's said Pizza Inn's largest shareholder, F.J.
Spillman, previously granted Pantera's an option to buy more
than one mln shares of Pizza Inn common stock owned by him.
    Pantera's also said it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger.
Pizza Inn has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to act as its
financial advisor, Pantera's said.
    Yesterday, Pantera's stock closed at 9.50 dlrs on NASDAQ,
while Pizza Inn's stock was quoted at 12 dlrs when the Amex
halted trading pending the announcement of the proposed merger.
    From its Dallas headquarters, Pizza Inn said completion of
the transaction is subject to certain conditions including that
the price of Pantera's stock average not less than seven dlrs
during the 20 trading days before the merger.
    Under the agreement, Pizza Inn said it will still be
permitted to complete a leveraged buyout agreement with Pizza
Inn Acquiring Corp, which has been approved by its
shareholders, but is subject to otaining financing.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new
company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old
Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.
    The communique was issued after two days of talks here
between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and
Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.
    Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria
16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved,
but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in
world iron ore markets.
    Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be
decided after a project feasibility study. This would be
completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials
said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World
Bank, which is also expected to give financial support.
    Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year,
will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early
1990.
    On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for
uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed
that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to
cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and
silver.

<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A World Bank team led by senior
economist Katrine Saito arrived in Uganda for talks on an
economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs
over three years.
    The four-member mission is expected to stay two to three
weeks. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is due here
over the same period, a World Bank offical said.
    The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on
deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues
likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery
program.
    Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most
of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating
industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors
and other agricultural needs.
    He did not say where the money would come from, but
diplomats expect the government to ask the World Bank and other
foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LONDON OPTIONS MARKET SEES CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Stock Exchange's traded
options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year,
and will more than double the range of options available by the
end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain
said.
    He told a news conference that more options contracts were
traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's
existence.
    Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts
traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from
19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth
was expected.
    "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of
1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible
constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.
    Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be
introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc
&lt;SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc &lt;PLYL.L> from
March 19.
    The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United
States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two
currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an
option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.
    Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate
the London options market's leading position in Europe,
especially important with French and Swiss equity options
trading planned to start this year.
    "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are
conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting
continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least
the next year.
    He said much of the recent growth in options had come from
inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But
now the retail options market was beginning to take off.
    The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted
floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left
almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in
the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have
encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.
    Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to
equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a
final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.
    The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options
market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the
options market would need more than half of the available
space.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

<TITLE>BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world
textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could
react was to retaliate.
    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile
imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."
    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
U.S. trading partners.
    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
weakened by the Iran scandal.
    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we
could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."
    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes
on a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. We
have to avoid that."
    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
shipments of Asian textiles.
    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a
conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."
    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross
the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.
    "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two
big powers," De Croo said.

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press
Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation
will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade
bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
other countries their access to the American market would be
curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"
Rostenkowski said.
    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
American market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in the
market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House
last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for
foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face
a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

    Fry said at an average price of 13,000 dollars, his
projected sales figure for North American-made GM cars in
Europe would mean turnover of between 91 million and 104
million dollars.
    GM sales in Europe of North American-made cars in the 1985
model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive
prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said.
    The North American-made GM vehicles sold in Europe are
manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, with
most sales in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.

International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement
on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto
Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation,
said.
    "There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to
quotas," Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry
on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the
delegations.
    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set quotas.
    The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1
but the full council is not due to meet again until September.
"I am not optimistic about an agreement soon," Hesse said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
micrographics company.
    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
trading as high as seven earlier.
    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said.
"Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
integrate the company in the second half."
    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.
    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
a share.
    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
a share.
    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Export Credits Guarantee Department has
named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
years, to the post of executive director, a department
spokesman said.
    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
years.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
services.
    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
thing we want to take a look at."
    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"
Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
recipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removed
from the list.

<TITLE>OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
10.6 mln a year earlier.
    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
lard and tallow/greases.
    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
previous two seasons.
    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
demand.
    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee producing countries must quickly
map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
coffee exporters' association, said.
    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
plummet.
    However, he said the market should also take into account
evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
near totality of the Central American crop.
    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past
10 years.
    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand
the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations
as well as for industrialized countries.
    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
those debts, he said.
    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,
while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"
Cardenas said.

    Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a
revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy
statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff
Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue
to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote
about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned
meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the
proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after
the record date for the meeting.
    In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own
about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of
the merger.
    Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the
outstanding shares will be required to approve the merger,
Tender Loving Care said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is
clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who
follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell
parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.
    But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers
whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands
of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and
replacement parts.
    Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many
opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's
intensified competition and the large volume of production in
North America planned by Japanese automakers.
    But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated
than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big
Three - General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.
    Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will
decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street
financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and
somewhat less so on Chrysler.
    And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the
industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its
sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable
parts-making businesses.

<TITLE>SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or
exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,
the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce
soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.
    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the
European Community and South America in the January/March
quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported
in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it
said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding
periods of 1986.
    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of
probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed
and large scale butter imports that were expected from March
onward, it said.
    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain
area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the
recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.
    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had
been bought recently by the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
increases.
    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
for special protection.
    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"
he said.
    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
proposed again this year.

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new
planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the
financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co &lt;BA> and
&lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said.
    "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the
manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and
Co. "They're called walkaway leases."
    AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus
but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,
which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.
    AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at
roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the
planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its
service in the Caribbean and to Europe.
    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the
planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.
The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year
extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days
notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman
Robert Crandall.
    "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"
Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off
balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the
financing is provided by the manufacturers.
    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own
the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said.
Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,
long-range A300-600 planes.
    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of
Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part
of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.
    Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before
by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of
planes, but not to this extent.
    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will
give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the
manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and
consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into
the early 1990s," he said.
    "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will
increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to
reduce their exposure to risk, he added.

<TITLE>IMF APPROVES 125.9 MLN SDR'S FOR JAMAICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund  said
it approved 125.9 mln SDR's to assist development in Jamaica.
    Of this total, 85 mln SDR's can be drawn over the next 15
months under a standby arrangement in support of the
government's economic and financial program.
    Another 40.9 mln is available immediately under the
compensatory financing facility, the IMF's pool of funds to
assist countries hit by export shortfalls. The IMF said that
Jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due to
reduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures.
    After some deterioration, the situation and prospects for
Jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly
as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates,
and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.
    The program that the new funding supports is designed to
continue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as to
achieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and a
balance of payments viability in the medium term.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fertility and Genetics Research Inc said
it will not establish further free-standing ovum transfer
centers and is exploring the establishment of general fertility
centers and alternative businesses.
    The company said this followed its evaluation of
unpublished technical information regarding some competing
technology which, if substantiated and replicated, could
adversely affect the company's operations.
    Fertility and Genetics said the non-surgical ovum transfer
procedure will continue to remain a viable option for infertile
couples to consider among the several alternative procedures
available in advanced reproductive medicine.
    "In particular, it is medically and psychologically
superior to surrogate motherhood, because the fertilized egg is
transferred prior to the gestation process, rather than after
maternal bonding with the child has taken place," the company
explained without further reference to the unpublished
technical information.

<TITLE>PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent heavy rains have not affected the
Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record
harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative
groups said.
    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of
cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,
told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)
was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101
quintales in the year to September 1986.
    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood
waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the
crop was unaffected.
    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa
Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last
year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.
    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if
they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.
    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this
year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,
assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.
    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members
last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another
235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO
members.

<TITLE>GAO SAYS FSLIC SHOWS DEFICIT, NEEDS FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential
liability from insolvent savings associations, the General
Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing.
    "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to 
establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion
dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near
future," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.
    "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLIC
would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end
of 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the
large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations
that continue to operate," Wolf said.
    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's
plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize
FSLIC.
    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC
insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were
insolvent.
    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,
earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three
quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations
lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.
    The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.
    Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight
billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings
associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said
are considered "hopelessly insolvent".

would make an announcement at 1530 EST/2030 gmt but the topic
was undisclosed.
    A spokesman said officials would brief reporters on details
of the announcement afterwards.
    Athough Reagan's topic was not disclosed, speculation
centered on the possible naming of a nominee to to head the CIA

separate arms control agreement on medium range missiles in
Europe.

<TITLE>GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of General Electric Co's biggest
businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
Wall Street analysts said.
    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said
Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, Heymann said.
    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, Heymann noted.
    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock."
    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
order "will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.
    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK> CONTINUES DRIVE INTO NEW MARKETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co, best known for its
cameras and film products, took several steps today to boost
its image as a diversified information systems company.
    The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new
electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast
computerized libraries of documents and pictures.
    Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging
market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach
five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may
pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.
    Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to
promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market
what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J.
Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business
imaging systems division.
    While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in
sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales
of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business
products will exceed four billion dlrs this year.
    "We're launching a major attack on these new markets,"
Greco said.
    "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its
bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.
    But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and
Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer
on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer
photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a
profit," he said.
     Kodak also announced the first commerically available
14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store the
equivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>French exporters estimated that around
600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for
delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.
    Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July
1986 and February this year.
    Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during
this month and around the same amount in April, they said.
    France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in
1985/86, according to customs figures.
    However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of
its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of
U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January
and making some purchases under the initiative.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD SEES BRAZIL LENDING PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with
commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and
Brazil.
    "This should result in substantial new lending for the
major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the
Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the
U.S. House of Representatives.
    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new
financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,
Mulford said.
    "We are concerned about the backlog of other financial
packages and would like to see these move ahead soon," he said,
"There is some evidence that this is already happening.
    Chile signed an agreement with banks last week, and there
was also an agreement with Venezuela on rescheduling principal
payments on previously renegotiated debt.
    "We look for rapid progress in commercial bank discussions
with Argentina, the Philippines, and ultimately Brazil," he
said.

Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in
aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto
salon.
    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9
sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet
aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for
Bertone's steel-structured sports cars.
    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in
Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association.
     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum
structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto
making methods and plants.
    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a
car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and
performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It
said the structures also provide long life without the need for
rust protection.
    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as
present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65
pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.

<TITLE>MOODY'S DOWNGRADES LORAL &lt;LOR> DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded to Baa-2 from A-3 the rating on Loral Corp's 7-1/4
pct convertible subordinated debentures of 2010 and on 10-3/4
pct subordinated sinking fund debentures due 1997.
    Moody's said it took the action, which affects
approximately 117 mln dlrs of debt, after examining Loral's
acquisition of Goodyear Aerospace Corp.
    It said the downgrade reflects the substantial increase in
the company's debt in order to finance the acquisition and the
risks of assimilating such a relatively large acquisition.

<TITLE>F.W. WOOLWORTH'S &lt;Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gail Appleson, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The specialty retailing area continues
to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and
dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
ago.
    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
income generated by the company's specialty store operations
accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
which 1,200 are in the United States.
    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as
they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."
    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
period.
    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
than general merchandise stores.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily
indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease
their debt burden.
    "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity
or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt
relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with
measures to encourage new equity investment and the
repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee
on International Development Institutions.
    Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to
the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging
from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions
for lending.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.
    He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective
because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,
create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can
help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

<TITLE>CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian economic growth is expected to
slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,
deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number."
    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she
added.
    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the
federal agency said in a statement.
    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen and Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England proposed that banks
in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization
to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.
    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of
credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they
lead manage.
    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative
paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and
deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.
    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond
securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of
new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by
Euromoney magazine.
    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead
managing eurobond issues.
    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of
England is concerned about intense competition for market share
which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to
imprudent credit risk.
    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as
banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules
suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as
regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk
than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of
England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to
accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters
act prudently.
    "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's
lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill
and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market
concerned...," the Bank's proposal said.
    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead
underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the
face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60
pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it
must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of
capital.
    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of
28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After
that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be
assessed at their full face value.
    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,
revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.
    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen
its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called
for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their
possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned
final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.
    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the
third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the
supervision of financial institutions.
    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,
aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building
Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing
with banks.
    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between
recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal
controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.
    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in
advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their
capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10
and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.
    However, preliminary consultations with bank
representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be
flawed, it said.
    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a
case-by-case basis rather than along general lines.
    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of
exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other
units of their own group of companies, the paper showed.
    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to
local governments and other public sector entities, and of
exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.
    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as
collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.
    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their
own group of companies would usually be looked into on a
case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.
    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and
other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should
be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments
provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.
    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and
those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee
Department would probably not qualify for such treatment.
    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of
another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling
could be exceeded in individual cases.
    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking
to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state
in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's
balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.
    On collateral security, it said this "should normally only
be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a
bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."
    "The presence of security taken on its own will be
considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure
in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional
circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. TO OFFER MISSILE TREATY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the United
States would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile
reductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow.
    Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the
White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max
Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for
consultations later this week. He said they will then return to
Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact.
    Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday
to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces
(INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said:
"This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF
reductions."
    "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our
negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text
at Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said.
    He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to
be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet
missiles, "none is more important than verification ... Any
agreement must be effectively verifiable."
    The United States has been working closely with allies and
friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on
reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual
elimination, the president said.
     He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed
upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in
Reykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leader
insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on
long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.
    "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said.
    He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage
of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to
agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the
earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

<TITLE>GOODYEAR &lt;GT> CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES CORPORATE RAIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that "terrorists in three-piece suits" are undermining
the nation's industrial base.
In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,
Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on."
    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
Mercer said.
    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.
    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down
three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
payroll by 10 pct, he said.
    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing
on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
takeovers have also hurt workers.

<TITLE>SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet winter grains could be off to
a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
for E.F. Hutton said.
    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
USDA analyst said.
    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.
    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
entire winter crop area, she said.
    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.
    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
a half," Martell said.

    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about

<TITLE>OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.
    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales," Margoshes said.
    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
December pact is falling apart.
    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally."
    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
North sea crude oil market.
    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    "The production probably is about their quota level and
largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result," Margoshes said.
    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    But others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.

<TITLE>COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Douglas Learmond, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee prices may have to fall even lower
to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and
traders said.
    The failure last night of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree
export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
futures markets today with the London May price reaching a
4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
close.
    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
under prices, some senior traders said.
    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
February last year following a sharp rise in international
prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.
    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,
President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said
they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed
at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it
is time to go and sell coffee."
    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans
to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade
sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public
selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market
last year.
    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split
between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average
exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
Dauster said.
    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way
of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.
    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and
non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
    It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"
policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome
to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve
different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.
    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO
and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
    "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.
    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO
session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
and how much producers will sink their differences should
prices fall further and remain depressed.
    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but
both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in
Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.
    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could
bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than
many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during
the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before
October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has
continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt
by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could
show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
    "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.

    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about

spokesman Fernand Leclerc said.
    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to
modernize the plant.
    He said there is a possibility the company will sell the
smelter, which currently employs 320 people, before its

<TITLE>ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG> TO CLOSE THREE PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegheny International Inc said it
plans to close three appliance manufacturing plants as part of
a restructuring.
    The company said it will close its Milwaukee plant by
October 1, idling 350 employees, and its Dayton, Tenn.,
facility, with about 300 employees, by March 1, 1988.
    In addition, a plant in Toronto will phase out production
of small electric appliances over the next eight month's,
affecting about 195 of the facility's 425 employees.
    Production of barbecue grills and lawn mowers is also under
review at the Toronto plant, operated by the company's Sunbeam
Corp (Canada) unit. The plant will continue selling appliances
in Canada.
    The company's Oster division makes blenders and other
appliances at the Milwaukee and Dayton plants. Oster
headquarters will stay in Milwaukee and manufacturing of
products will be consolidated at other facilities in
McMinnville and Cookville, both in Tennessee.

<TITLE>CONGRESS PASSES APPLIANCE STANDARD BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congress passed and sent to President
Reagan a bill that sets energy efficiency standards for major
household appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners,
washers and dryers and furnances.
    Final action came on a voice vote in the House. The Senate
had passed the bill, 89-6, on February 17.
    Reagan vetoed a similar bill last year after Congress had
adjourned, but has indicated he will sign this measure.
    The standards will take effect over the next six years and
appliance manufacturers will then have five years to redesign
their appliances to meet the standards.

<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exports of American wine rose 14.9
per cent last year to a total of 7.2 million gallons, the Wine
Institute said.
    The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent
of the exported wine was from California and the top three
markets were Canada, Japan and Britain.
    Japan, which edged out Britain as the leading importer of
American wines in 1985, continued in second place.
    Canadian imports rose 3.2 per cent to 2.6 million gallons;
Japan, 9.9 per cent to 1.2 million gallons, and Britain, 20.2
per cent to 962,360 gallons.
    A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of
the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the
California wine industry contributed significantly to the
increased shipments.
    The 1986 wine exports were valued at 34.7 mln dlrs, up from
27.6 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> TO REPUCHASE COMMON STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp said its directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par
value common stock by the end of 1990.
    GM said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed
10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock.
    It said the stock repurchase, as market conditions permit,
will be funded from a portion of the cash flows generated by
reduced capital spending and anticipated performance
improvements.
    GM also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many
as five mln shares each of its class E and class H common, with
about half of the proposed repurchases completed by year end.
    GM also said it is considering offering an odd-lot
repurchase program for its class H stock by mid-year.
    GM said the class E and H repurchases would increase
participation in the net income of its Electronic Data Systems
Corp &lt;GME> and Hughes Electronic Corp &lt;GMH> subsidiaries by
holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common.
    GM also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending, excluding EDS and Hughes Aircraft Co, to 7.9
billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6
billion dlrs in 1986.
    It also said improvements in operating performance are
expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990.
    "We have one overriding objective--to position GM so that
it is producing the best products available in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace," said Chairman Roger B. Smith.
    GM had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common
outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class E and 66.6 mln shares of
class H outstanding at year end 1986.
    GM said that its par value holders currently participate in
the 56 pct of the earnings of EDS and 67 pct of Hughes'
earnings.
    GM also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all
three classes of its common in connection with ongoing
requirements of various benefit plans.
    That buyback, it said, will involve about nine mln shares
of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class E
and H common in 1987.
    GM said the repuchased shares of its par value common will
be held in its treasury indefinitely for possible future
business use.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the
activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected
developing countries, committee staff said.
    The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade
teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal
agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.
    The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the
U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs --
PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and
upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional
or commercial benefits to interested countries.
    The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the
U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for
International Development and private voluntary organizations
such as U.S. Wheat Associates.
    The bill would require teams within six months to visit
seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India,
Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.
    Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight
countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican
Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.
Other countries could be added to the list.
    Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting
stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by
the committee tomorrow.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Hume, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. is sticking for the moment
to its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debt
payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and
not with governments, U.S. officials said.
    "I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help
Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to
do," a senior administration official stated.
    "Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,"
said another official following an assessment of that country's
latest debt crisis.
    The official, who asked that his name not be used, said the
National Security Council, the Treasury and State departments
and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the
situation.
    In a related development, small regional banks that have
made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American
countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
here tomorrow.
    Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks
late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion
dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.
    Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange
has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service
its debt.
    The official said the interagency meeting was called to
discuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on
(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro."
    Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political
discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt
problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from
official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker,
Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials.
    Another senior administration official said he was
perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis
with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when
Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.
    "We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems
bizarre, just bizarre," the official said.
    One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense,"
and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil,
for which that country was in arrears.
    Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but
wanted to avoid a confrontation.
    The consensus among administration officials seems to be
that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic
economic problems.
    "Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would
not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their
economic policy," a senior official added.
    Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker
tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at
the Fed's suggestion.
    "Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they
want to say something," one regional bank official said.
    But other banking sources said that regional banks, many of
which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, are
dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, in
the refinancing of foreign debts.
    The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is
dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest
rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors,
and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve
role in the rescheduling process.

<TITLE>FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Total supply of frozen concentrated
orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly
above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below
the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department
said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown
sharp gains to date.
    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be
affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on
whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.
have caused injury.
    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit
coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower
prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.
    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage
at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year
earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.
    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced
supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.
    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed
noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining
suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a
consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.

<TITLE>SECURITIES TAX WOULD NEED WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for
any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions,
before considering the issue, a staff member said.
    In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on
whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said.
    Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in
charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House
Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of
tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did
not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday
as a possible way to cut the federal deficit.
    The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and
Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax.
However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had
another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level
rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.
    Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases
of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17
billion dlrs a year, the aide said.
    The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the
proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly
opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities
transactions."
    NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement,
"Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide
and would be counter-productive, making America's securities
industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time
when financial markets are becoming increasingly
international."

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
September-January.
    National weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.
    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

<TITLE>PENNZOIL &lt;PZL> SAYS IT HAS MADE SETTLEMENT OFFERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     HOUSTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtke
said the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 
to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and
that a settlement was "in the best interests of both
companies."
    Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders,
said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent
public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling
the case.
    "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before
and after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in the
letter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make
such clearly untrue statements."
    Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury
judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan
to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two
billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded
to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the
total amount back above 10 billion dlrs.
    Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory
proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.
    "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers,
Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter.
"In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were
proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not
accept."
    The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made
by either Pennzoil or Texaco.
    "If and when Texaco's management changes its position and
demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to
settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to
cooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, is
clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not
attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and
directors."
    Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and
profits from those assets that have since been sold
"approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion
dlrs for Getty.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
proposes to rename the "USDA Good" grade of beef to "USDA Select."
    The department said the proposed change is in response to a
petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would
present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help
calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.
    Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less
marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.
    Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged
under the proposal.

<TITLE>HILTON HOTELS &lt;HLT> GIVEN RIGHT TO SUE IRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hilton Hotels Corp said it received
approval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service
to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad
Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks.
    That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up by
the late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp,
worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hilton
attorneys.
    Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase
those 6,782,000 shares, the company said.
    However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the
Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to
a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints
of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private
foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the
Hilton Corp.
    That act said that a private foundation could not own more
than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over
that figure had to be sold.
    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law
required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of
the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,
Barron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to the
Hilton lawyers.
    Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax
law, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block
of stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron was
attempting to keep the large block from going public, leaving
the family in control of the corporation.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Government will likely
reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
around 98 dlrs per tonne.
     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
breakeven export price, it said.
    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
department said.
    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
    But the department said the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
1989/90.
    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
wheat exports, the department said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ITT &lt;ITT> CONSIDERING STOCK REPURCHASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>ITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told a
meeting of analysts that the company has been considering a
repurchase of some shares.
    "We are considering that as a very important way to
increase earnings per share," Araskog said and noted the aim
was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market.
    ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from
operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share
a year ago.
    Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares
being studied for repurchase.
    "We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988,"
Araskog told the analysts. "We have more confidence...than any
other time in our history - at least with me."
    Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then
has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired
by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Last year, the company transferred its European
telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie
Generale d'Electricite, called Alcatel N.V.
    ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture.
    Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year,
Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small
companies was recently concluded.
    "We really wrapped everything up," he said adding that the
company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock
transfers.
    Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the
Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany
receiveables, which should be paid by the end of March.
    Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was
considering repurchasing some shares, but a spokesman noted
that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of
the sharp appreciation in its stock price.
   
    Breaking out operating earnings by divisions, ITT said
diversified services, which consists of insurance, financial
services, communications and hotels, saw the sharpest rise in
operating income, to 454 mln dlrs, from 297 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Industrial and defense operating income declined 48 mln
dlrs, to 315 mln dlrs, while natural resources increased 10 mln
dlrs, to 73 mln dlrs, the company said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese traders have apparently
sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next
six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling
to sell at current low world prices.
    If the reports are confirmed, China's major export
destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could
increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.
    China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of
corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said.

<TITLE>SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.
    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.
    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
world demand for oil.

<TITLE>EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community, EC, sold
75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85
and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing
bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per
tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest
report on Export Markets for U.S grains.
    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during
1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in
the 1985/86 season, it said.
    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a
time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat
import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current
forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.
    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in
domestic production, and says government plans to lower the
guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs
will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.
    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of
the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of
U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only
600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he felt a proposed takeover by Japan's &lt;Fujitsu Ltd> of
U.S.-based Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, a subsidiary of
Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, should be carefully reviewed.
    He told the Semiconductor Industry Association the deal
would soon be discussed by representatives of several different
government departments.
    The Reagan administration has previously expressed concern
that the proposed takeover would make Fujitsu a powerful part
of the U.S. market for so-called supercomputers at a time when
Japan has not bought any American-made supercomputers.
    In addition, U.S. defense officials have said they were
worried semiconductor technology could be transferred out of
the United States, eventually giving Japanese-made products an
edge in American high-technology markets for defense and other
goods.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker recently told a Senate
committee the proposed takeover would be reviewed by the 
cabinet-level Economic Policy Council.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Stock Exchange (Amex),
which faces stiff competition from the New York Stock Exchange
and the over-the-counter market for listed companies, said it
is launching a 2 mln dlr advertising campaign.
    Amex will advertise on television for the first time, it
said. The campaign also includes print ads.
    "Our entry into television advertising reflects our optimism
for the future. We have proved ourselves a vigorous and
competitive marketplace and we are eager to communicate that
wherever and whenever we can," said Arthurt Levitt Jr., chairman
of the exchange, in a statement.
    The exchange said its advertising campaign, with the theme
"We Extend Your Reach,"  focuses on its role as a diversified
financial exchange trading both stocks and options.
    The television commercials will air on network, cable and
local television stations. The commercials will be broadcast
during March, May, September and November.
    The commercials, titled "The Options Pit," and "An Attractive
Investment," describe Amex's technology advances and
international ties. The print campaign consists of four ads
targeted to specific audiences: listed companies, individual
investors, institutional investors and brokers.
    The Amex currently has a two-way trading link with the
Toronto Exchange and has an agreement with the Europeaon
Options Exchange to trade XMI, the major market index of 20
blue-chip stocks, during European trading hours. The latter is
expected to begin by mid-1987.

    The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds

chairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs was
collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct,
considerably less than expected.
    "We believe that this indicates good producer support for
the new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets,
from packers and from dealers," Rosendale said.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Despite earlier optimistic
indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage
in its development and recent reports of heat stress could
reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87
(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct
from the previous year.
    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a
period of severe droughts, which at one point required South
Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it
said.
    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing
increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.
    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available
supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the
department said.

<TITLE>CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
in the futures markets.
    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
attractive under normal circumstances.
    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
traders said.
    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
more attractive deal from the government, they added.
    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
put soybean land back into cotton.
    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate Agriculture Committee is
expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from
government conservation regulations those farmers who have
rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with
row crops, committee staff said.
    Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly
erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm
program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in
later years.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said
recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less
erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced
strictly row crops.

organizations.
    The National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, will receive
almost 1.8 mln dlrs for use in the areas of food service,

dlrs to continue work in educating health care officials.
120,000 dlrs in matching funds will be provided to the meat
board for use in the development of a better market for
processed meats.
    The Meat Export Federation was awarded 50,000 dlrs to
increase the market for chilled and processed U.S. pork in
Japan and Singapore. Retail stores in these two countries will
be providing additional funding for the program.
    A total of 5,000 dlrs for work in encouraging McDonalds to
expand its McRib sandwich to Japan and Singapore was also
awarded to the Meat export Federation.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> BUYBACK SEEN CALMING SHAREHOLDERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street analysts said a share
repurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part
an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent
repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.
    "He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analyst
Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm of
criticism from people on the institutional side."
    Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the
shares in the near term but some had reservations about the
long term effects of the plan.
    "They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by
the buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been
hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional
investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five
billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor
Co's &lt;F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis
than that of Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.
    Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy
back stock on a large scale.
    The General Motors plan, announced after a board of
directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20
pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.
    The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln
class E &lt;GME> and class H &lt;GMH> shares. GM shares closed at
75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's
announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which
trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was
making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.
    "The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," said
Ronald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.
    "I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming
from unless they borrow," Glantz said. "Their credit rating is
going to fall." GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending.
    Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by
going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has
37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for
closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for
workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will be
seen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said. "GM must be
challenging the union to make it the strike target."
    Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM
and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think
the overall plan was "prudent."
    "Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in
the stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said.
    He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost
reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels
"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the
confines of their cash flow." Phillippi, who has been telling
clients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance
"we've got to feel they're doing something constructive."

<TITLE>ROCKWELL &lt;ROK> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp
continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,
despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its
business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters.
    Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended
December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared
to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.
    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and
analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's
Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the
industrial automation market.
    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It
is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.
    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
management conference, said first quarter sales for the
Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He
said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
on a quarterly basis.
    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
research and development phase of government contracts should
not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.
    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing
could limit technological innovation.
    "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term,
we have a very serious problem."
    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest
competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense
electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage
of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

<TITLE>REAGAN SEEKS MORE AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, seeking to salvage
his Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said a
major U.S. economic program for the region was working but
needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned.
    In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approval
of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central
American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total
economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992.
    The report, mandated by Congress, explains how the
administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the
Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developed
a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to
offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels.
    The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.
    "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the
Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid
to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said.
    Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefed
reporters, said the administration will not try to link
approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with
the vastly more popular economic package for the region, as
some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested.
    He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra
scandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr
allotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fighting
Managua's leftist Sandinista government.
    Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest
fight in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believed
a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time
in six years -- would back the military request.

<TITLE>SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Swap Dealers
Association has developed the first standard form contract for
use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap
transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's
co-chairman.
    The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected
to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient,
he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce
the expense of swap documentation," Japsper said.
    Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of
all new issues eventually become part of either an interest
rate or currency swap.
    An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually
acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's
interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a
floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice
versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains
with the original borrower.
    Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of
swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some
portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the
balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient
capital to cushion it.
    Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president
of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of
England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later
today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital
standards for counterparties in swaps.
    The standards are part of the recently announced
convergence agreement between the two countries in which
regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements
for institutions.
    McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a
"level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market.
    He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more
primary capital against swap transactions than is the current
practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to
issuers.
    The issuers might then choose to do business with
lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking
rules.
    He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for
swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.
    That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he
said.

BellSouth Corp &lt;BLS> unit Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph
Co's decision to postpone the start up of new conversion
assignments at Geonex's Chicago Aerial Survey unit could
negatively affect its fiscal 1987 revenues.
    The company said it had expected higher revenues from the
records conversion work, but it now foresees revenues from
Southern Bell work at about eight mln dlrs, the same level as
last fiscal year.
    Geonex said Southern Bell will let CAS continue work in
progress and it expects to perform mechanized posting and
records conversion for Southern Bell through 1989.
    But, it added that the Southern Bell decision has forced it
to pursue opportunities with other telephone companies and
municipalities to replace the Southern Bell work.

<TITLE>ANDRIESSEN HAILS EC MILK PACT, PROMISES FARM AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community Farm Commissioner
Frans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy
output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help
farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.
    "We are now in a favourable position to improve the
situation in the dairy sector," he told a news conference.
    The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion
European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of
butter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new
stocks from accruing.
    A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in
December, but approval was held up by a row over Commission
proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus
stocks into store.
    After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed
rules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public
stocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices
were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores.
    Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what
he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for
cuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming
season.
    The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu
package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay
compensation to those who opt for less intensive production
methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections
had forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which
he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.
    He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older
farmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out
of agricultural production or passing it to successors.
    The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
EC and member states to provide direct income supports to
hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give
full details, but member state aid would be subject to "strict
criteria to avoid distortion of competition."

<TITLE>ITALIAN TREASURY TO ISSUE NEW CERTIFICATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Italian treasury said it will issue
3,000 billion lire of a new type of indexed government paper,
discount certificates (CTS), on March 18.
    Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said at a news conference
the new certificates will be heavily discounted and aimed at
small investors rather than institutions.
    The Treasury said in a statement the annual yield of the
seven-year certificates will be indexed to 50 pct of the annual
yield of 12-month treasury bills.
    Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue
will be 9.66 pct. "The launch of the new certificate has to be
viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as
a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate
issues," the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be
certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers
a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and
variable-rate investments.

<TITLE>GREECE PLANS TO REDUCE 1987 FOREIGN BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowing
to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986,
and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing
payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris
Halikias, said.
    He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded
immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low
international interest rates in order to make servicing
payments at a lower cost.
    Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at
end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.
    He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will
go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not
give figures.
    He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year
austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current
account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record
3.3 billion in 1985.
    Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a
current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.
    He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for
imports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.
    Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion
dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the
same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs
from 11.4 billion.

<TITLE>B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;British Columbia
Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
four year term.
    The company said the credit facility is extendable under
certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
and completion of formal documentation.
    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
suspended.
    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
    If future dividends are not declared after the April
exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
    The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
Columbia.
    B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.
    B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
company said.
    The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
    It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs

<TITLE>U.S. FACTORY ORDERS FELL 4.0 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>New orders for manufactured goods
fell 8.2 billion dlrs, or 4.0 pct, in January to a seasonally
adjusted 194.5 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    It was the largest one month decrease in orders since a 4.5
pct drop in May, 1980, the department said.
    Excluding defense orders, factory orders fell 5.2 pct in
January after a 4.8 pct December rise.
    The department revised December factory orders upward to an
increase of 1.6 pct from 1.2 pct.
    The new orders decline in January was concentrated in
durable goods, where orders fell 7.4 billion dlrs, or 6.7 pct,
to 103 billion dlrs. The department had estimated on February
26 that January durable goods orders fell 7.5 pct.
    Orders for non-durables in January fell 700 mln dlrs, or
0.8 pct, to 91.5 billion dlrs.
    These figures compared with a December increase in durables
orders of 1.5 pct and a 1.7 pct rise in non-durables.
    Defense orders rose 2.2 billion dlrs, or 49.7 pct, in
January after falling 57.7 pct in December, the department
said.
    Orders for non-defense capital goods fell 17 pct in January
after increasing by 5.7 pct in December.
    Within major industry categories, orders declines were
widespread, the department said.
    Electrical machinery orders fell 19.8 pct, or 3.6 billion
dlrs, after a 9.5 pct increase in December.
    Primary metals orders fell 17.7 pct, or 1.9 billion dlrs,
following a 12.1 pct increase in December.
    Orders for transportation equipment were down 4.5 pct in
January after falling 0.6 pct in December.
    Orders for non-electrical machinery were down 6.1 pct in
January after falling by 7.1 pct in December.
    Manufacturers' shipments fell 3.8 pct, or 7.8 billion dlrs,
to a total 196.7 billion dlrs. The department said it was the
largest one month fall in shipments since a 5.1 pct drop in
December, 1974.
    Unfilled orders fell 0.6 pct, or 2.2 billion dlrs, to a
total 363 billion dlrs.
    Factory inventories in January rose 0.5 pct, or 1.5 billion
dlrs, to 277.0 billion dlrs, only the second rise since July
and concentrated in finished goods.

<TITLE>WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> HAS 4TH QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge
of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
    The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
    Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
    The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
    Williams said the charges in the current year were related
to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
for future stability and growth in earnings.
    Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
    Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA SETS FOREIGN DEBT TARGETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela plans to have a public sector
foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the
present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term,
public finances director Jorge Marcano said.
    He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion
dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable
amount which will assist in development plans.
    The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank
advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling
accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8
pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.
    In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said
he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do
with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision
to suspend interest payments.
    "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the
U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften
their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil
announcement came later," he said.
    Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,
objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact
with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before
Venezuela's.
    Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors
seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,
which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "We
cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new
agreement and present the financing programmes we have," he
said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.
    Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign
borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral
agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next
two years. According to the restructured accord, this would
work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German engineering union IG
Metall will hold nationwide warning strikes on March 9, to
press demands for a 35-hour week and a five pct wage increase,
a union spokeswoman said.
    Further details of the time and place of the strikes will
be given at a press conference on the same day, she added.
    In mid-February, IG Metall chairman Franz Steinkuehler
called for the strikes after 35 unsuccessful rounds of talks.
    IG Metall shut down the entire auto industry for seven
weeks in summer 1984 to press employers to cut the working week
to 35 hours from 40. A compromise of 38.5 hours was agreed.

<TITLE>SENATE'S PROXMIRE URGES CURBS ON TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Banking Committee chairman
William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate
takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.
    "At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk
arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider
precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing
in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk
arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing
on corporate takeovers.
    "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a
complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and
investment banking," Proxmire said.
    He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts
were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives
who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have
become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial
buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman
David Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game to
continue unchecked, would be economic suicide," Champion
International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added.

<TITLE>SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan
this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
    "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he
said.
     "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
which have a similar productive structure," he said.
    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
international trade fairs.
    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
25 billion peseta grant.
    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries.
    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
    "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.
    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
turning their backs on foreign markets.
    "They have to realise their share of the home market is
going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign
companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and
it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."

<TITLE>COMMISSION REPORT WARNS ON EC FINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community is close to
bankruptcy, the EC's Executive Commission said in a report.
    In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC
finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a
budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on
the brink of bankruptcy."
    The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a
major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign
ministers are due to start debating next month.
    The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the
"considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions
they themselves have taken.
    "Budgetary practices have emerged which fictitiously
disguise the real impact of expenditure decisions," it said.
Adding that such practices were unacceptable.
    It put the EC's accumulated liabilities at the end of last
year at 12.2 billion European Currency Units and estimated
these would rise by a further five billion Ecus this year.

<DATELINE>    MARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Digital Equipment said it is
taking several initiatives designed to make it easier and more
cost effecive for customers to purchase and use its products
and services.
    The company also said it is introducing three new mid-range
VAX systems.
    Digital stated the moves "further strengthened its
leadership position in the computer industry."
    The company said it also adjusted prices acrossall product
lines to more accurately reflect performance and customer value.
    Digital said the new products -- the VAX 8250, VAX 8350 and
VZX 8530 systems -- replace earlier models and provide up to 40
pct increased performance.
    It said the new "systems reflect Digital's ability to
sustain its present leadership in integrated, networked
systems."
    Effective today, the company said, it is adopting new
business practices to remain responsive to the needs of
customers and the rapidly changing marketplace, specifically

hardware, including VAX and PDP systems, all options and
peripherals. In addition, customers can select to extend their
hardware warranties up to three years at the time of purchase.

all product list prices with increases to reflect full system
value on high functionality systems and software.
    Without providing any details, it also said the are price
reductions of up to 50 pct on selected memories and disks.
    "Based on the analysis of product mix, price adjustments
will generally result in minimal net impact in costs in a
typical user enterprise," it added.

<TITLE>VEREINS- UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - Vereins- </DATELINE><BODY>und Westbank AG &lt;VHBG.F> plans
to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of
financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer
Luckey said.
    He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in
Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a
branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering
opening a branch in London.
    Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly
29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from
42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks.
    The group balance sheet, including for the first time
VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9
billion marks, Luckey said.
    The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2
billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8
billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
while loans to companies rose seven pct.
    Foreign business and securities trading turnover also
increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own
account contributed to record operating profits.
    Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1
mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to
156.7 mln, Luckey said.
    Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in
West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.
    The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct
of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct.
    The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986,
and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE CONCERNED ABOUT KOREAN/TAIWAN DEFICITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of Commerce Malcolm
Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade
deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an
adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of
improvement.
    Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industry
advisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under
discussion with those countries.
    "I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we
probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large
surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said.
    In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters,
Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover
by Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer.
    He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing U.S.
companies into the giant computer business while at the same
time attempting to acquire control of a U.S. company that does
major computer business in the U.S. market.
    Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful
that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by
the autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain,
remained unresolved.

<TITLE>PS NEW MEXICO &lt;PNM> STUDIES SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Public Service Co of New
Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution
system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln
dlrs.
    The utility said it advised a customer task force this is
one restructuring alternative being considered for the
company's electric business.
    The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's
overall initiative in response to several goals announced by
New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained.
    Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its
reorganization concept would be to separate the company's
electric utility operation into independent generation and
distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted
35 mln dlr a year rate decrease.
    Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a
variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes
"the concept may well have an application in the utility
business and intend to investigate it fully."
    The generation company would provide projected power needs
of the distribution entity under a 30-year "power security
agreement" which would have a federally regulated rate
structure, the company said.
    Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could
provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility
companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company
approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986.
    This holding company would be the general partner of the
limited partnership, the company said.
    The company said its limited partnership concept was
presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov.
Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals.
    It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an
alternative structure that would  help reduce rates through a
lower overall cost of capital.
    Last month the governor said "I have outlined to PNM
critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may
administration in achieving" adding the goals include immediate
rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation
of business expansion.
    The company told the task force the new distribution
company, under the limited partnership alternative or
otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state
regulators.
    PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be
owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its
rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and
transmission services. The generation company would have no
retail customers.
    PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan
with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would
also be needed by FERC.

<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Castle and Cooke Inc said it would
take a fourth quarter after-tax loss of 33.9 mln dlrs from the
previously reported sale of its Flexi-Van container leasing
business to Itel Corp &lt;ITEL> for about 215 mln dlrs.
    Earlier, the company reported a loss for the fourth quarter
ended January 3 of 31.9 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, compared
with a loss of 3.3 mln dlrs, or 21 cts per share, in 1985's
fourth quarter.
    For the year, however, the diversified holding company
reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share,
versus 46.4 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, in 1985.
    David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
"Both our food business and our real estate operations
increased their earnings during the year (1986)."
    But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by
depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by
oversupplies.
    The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly
executive vice president,  has been named president and chief
operating officer of Flexi-Van Corp, while William Burns has
been named executive vice president of Flexi-Van.

<TITLE>U.K. ONE BILLION STG BOND ISSUE EXHAUSTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A one billion stg issue of nine pct
Exchequer stock due 2002 which became available for trading
only this morning was exhausted in mid-afternoon trading on the
U.K. Government bond market, dealers said.
    The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operating
as a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stg
pct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were sold
out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bonds
started trading this morning at 20 stg pct.
    Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand
throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.
    Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from
both domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan and
the U.S.
    Although the issue had not been designated as free of tax
to residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment for
the market in general had generated foreign buying.
    The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it
was announced and dealers said that even first thing this
morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable
existing stocks.
    However, sterling's continuing firm performance had
prompted interest in the tap right at the outset.
    The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid
structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of
the major part of the price until April 27, but also conferred
a substantial gearing element.
    This meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought
the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the
market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total
purchase price was tied up initially.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community is close to
bankruptcy, the EC's Executive Commission said in a report.
    In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC
finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a
budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on
the brink of bankruptcy."
    The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a
major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign
ministers are due to start debating next month.
    The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the
"considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions
they themselves have taken.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC Executive Commission has backed
a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline
in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.
    It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC
states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead
at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC
ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban.
"It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.
    But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage
the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas
stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to
stock.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY AIDE WARNS ON INFLATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the
exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and
trigger inflation.
    He told a meeting of the President's Export Council that
the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to
reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained
much the same.
    But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could
be inflation in the United States.
    Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause
economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that
would not be in America's interest because it would close those
markets to U.S. goods.

<TITLE>LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Feizal Samath, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leaf disease affecting seven pct of
Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and
raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and
researchers told Reuters.
    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber
Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus
"corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the
leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.
    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the
crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000
tonnes.
    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber
clones if no immediate action is taken.
    "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees
seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use
chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said.
    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at
Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the
fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State
Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber
land with the balance belonging to small private producers with
a total of 145,600 hectares.
    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research
Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for
planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these
clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older
PBX Malaysian clones.
    Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided
to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be
treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.
    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week
but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there
is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman
for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.
    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about
four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe
one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this
week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same
period.
    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average
of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in
December because of wintering in early February in producing
areas.
    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with
the supply position showing improvements.
    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last
month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.
    "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,
meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of
the rubber we already had," one buyer said.
    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and
speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals
aggravated the problem.
    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter
closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would
ease further.
    They said another problem that could hit the industry is
the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains
expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further
shortages," one official said.
    "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR MAKERS HOPE TO PROFIT FROM WEAK DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Geneva Motor Show, the first major
car show of the year, opens tomorrow with U.S. Car makers
hoping to make new inroads into European markets due to the
cheap dollar, automobile executives said.
    Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and General Motors Corp &lt;GM> sell cars in
Europe, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM
also makes a few thousand in North American plants for European
export.
     Now Chrysler Corp &lt;C> is saying it will begin exporting
American-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, a
market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy.
    Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany
manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last
year -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European
market.
    Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain and
Britain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about
1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said.
    James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped
for a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made
vehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (North
American-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. "A
low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told Reuters.
    Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his
projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million
and 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added.
    That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500
North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs.
    Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture all
of its cars sold on the continent.  But Walter Hayes, vice
president of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect a
large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. 
"We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe
is inevitably a small volume market."
    Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to
European environmental specifications cut into profit margins.
    But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said
the weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. 
"After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to
re-enter the European market," he said.
    "We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here
because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of
the favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the
dollar."

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is planning changes in
the system by which banks bid for funds in securities
repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open
market instrument, central bank officials said.
    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender
process to two days from three currently, enabling the
Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it
chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.
    The changes will probably come into force in April.
    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at
the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank
for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.
    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody
accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,
which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.
    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such
accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.
    The change to come into force next month will allow the
Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,
in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.
    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on
Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the
result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.
    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28
days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or
longer tender periods being necessary.
    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday
to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow
(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the
carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt
yesterday (Tuesday).
    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the
shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely
technical, with no direct implications for interest rates.
    "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"
said an official at the Hesse LZB.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December
that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater
success since their introduction in their present form two
years ago, and praised their flexibility.
    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact
instrument even more flexible, banking economists said.
    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it
possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for
periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,
to respond to changing money market conditions.
    "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be
refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," said
Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann
Remsperger.
    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money
market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest
rates, he said.

<TEXT TYPE="UNPROC">&#2;
MIDLAND RIGHTS ISSUE STILL EXPECTED SAY ANALYSTS LONDON, March
4 - Midland Bank Plc's &lt;MDBL.L> 1986 results suggest its shares
show further recovery potential, although a rights issue is
still expected in the next few months, banking analysts said.
    A rights issue of the order of 400 mln stg is seen, perhaps
in June if there is no U.K. General election, they added.
Midland Chairman Sir Donald Barron would not comment on the
rights question at a news conference.
    Earlier, Midland reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 434 mln
stg, up from 351 mln the previous year, in line with market
forecasts, dealers said. Midland shares were up 14p at 633p.
    Midland said its 1986 results included Crocker National
Corp for the first five months, prior to its sale last May. If
results were restated excluding distortions stemming from the
Crocker sale they would show a 1986 pre-tax profit of 432 mln
stg compared with 366 mln, it said.
    Barron said that after the sale of Crocker and
restructuring during the last two years the group had "put the
past firmly behind us in 1986" and was now "focusing our
considerable resources on the exciting opportunities ahead."
    Chief Executive Sir Kit McMahon said U.K. Operations were
the main source of profits, with 83 pct or 434 mln stg.
    Both net interest income and non-interest income were ahead
of 1985.
    A key component in domestic asset growth was a 96 pct rise
in Midland's mortgage portfolio to 2.7 billion stg, comfortably
exceeding a 2.5 billion target, McMahon said. Overall sterling
advances rose over 18 pct to 20.2 billion stg.
    Pre-tax profits in investment banking rose 27 pct to 65 mln
stg despite the heavy start-up and integration costs. However,
this included the group's full range of activities in this area
from its treasuries operations to its merchant bank to
securities and gilts trading activities.
    No breakdown of this figure was given although McMahon said
venture capital activites contributed 17 mln stg to profit. He
said the group's gilts trading was operating at a profit
although its securities activities were not, but would give no
further details.
    International banking profits rose 80 pct to 54 mln stg,
benefitting from past restructuring and good performances from
European subsidiaries.
    Crocker and the Bracton subsidiary created by Midland to
work out Crocker's problem loans made a loss of 44 mln stg in
1986 against a 35 mln loss in 1985.
    Bracton assets now stood at 300 mln dlrs and had been fully
provisioned, McMahon said.
    Charges for bad and doubtful debts declined to 357 mln stg
against 431 mln the previous year and the bank said that
excluding Crocker, it would have been 320 mln.
    McMahon noted that total cover for bad debts had increased
to three pct of lendings in 1986 from 2.6 pct in 1985. He said
no evidence of increasing consumer credit delinquency and fewer
U.K. Corporate defaults allowed for a lower domestic debt
charge in 1986.
    McMahon said Midland's exposure in South America remained
unchanged on 1985, with 1.4 billion stg outstanding to Brazil,
1.3 billion to Mexico and 600 mln to Argentina.
    Following the lead of the other four major U.K. Banks
Midland moved charges against lending to rescheduling countries
from general to specific provisions.
    This was the key factor behind a reduction in its tax rate
to just under 40 pct in 1986 from 59 pct in 1985, McMahon said.
    One major problem still to be faced by the bank was to
further reduce its cost/income ratio, which is still well above
its competitors at 72 pct, he added.

<TITLE>GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cost of living in West Germany will
likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the
HWWA economic research institute said.
    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
first part of 1987.
    Provisional inflation figures for February released last
week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
against the same month a year earlier.
    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17
dlrs per barrel.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK SAYS S. AMERICAN DEBTORS STILL TALKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin American debtor nations are
still willing to negotiate on their debts, World Bank director
for Latin America and the Caribbean Rainer Steckhan said.
    In an article published in today's Handelsblatt daily,
Steckhan said despite decisions by Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador
and Brazil to suspend some interest payments, these nations
were still willing to talk constructively about their debts.
    "These countries are still prepared to negotiate, and the
instruments of cooperation developed thus far provide the means
to deal with the crisis over time," Steckhan said.
    Several highly indebted nations have made great efforts to
meet their debt payments, especially Latin American countries,
Steckhan said.
    Chile achieved gross national product growth of five to six
pct last year and quadrupled its trade surplus from 1984,
despite lower prices of key commodity exports like copper.
    Mexico, hit by a catastrophic earthquake and declines in
world oil prices also boosted its non-oil exports by one third
in 1986, the highest growth rate in its post-war history.
    The World Bank's annual lending to Latin America rose to
4.8 billion dlrs last year from three billion in 1984, he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve Board voted
unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that
takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
assets.
    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
today by the Bank of England.
    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
contracts and similar financial instruments.
    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
that banks would be required to take into account in
calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
maintain.
    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
    The additional guidelines proposed today would determine
the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
    The current exposure would be measured by the
mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
replacement cost.
    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking
regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the
asset.
    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the
capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
the principal participants in these types of activities.
    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the
potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to
compete in world financial markets.
    However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in
such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
profiles of some banking organizations."
    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts traded on organized exchanges.
    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was
not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital
rules.

<TITLE>EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of
social and structural measures agreed early today by European
Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers
for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission
sources said.
    The ministers agreed that under this "extensification"
scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut
output of specific products by at least 20 pct.
    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and
wine, they added.
    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by
reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their
number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,
farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity
for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.
    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but
will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on
the production they forego.
    The sources said the package also contains provisions for
payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting
or improving the environment.
    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured
farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such
allowances are available only for livestock.
    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into
alternative farming techniques, the sources added.
    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen
said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
EC and member states to provide direct income supports for
relatively poor farmers.
    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state
aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of
competition."
    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a
difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus
production.
    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night
proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55
or over who gave up production. Those who took their land
completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to
their heirs, would have received more generous payments.
    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised
proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme
agreed.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Fuel Gas Co said it has
proposed a plan of reorganization for &lt;Argo Petroleum Corp>.
    The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources
Corp subsidiary to receive 75 pct of Argo's principal producing
and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing
Argo's debt to Seneca.
    The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr
advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said.
    National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a
term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's
unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal
secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling
about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs.
    National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would
allow it to capitalize, together with other assets, a new
company for its existing shareholders.
    National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing
secured debt to be refinanced in an 8,875,000 dlr refinancing
note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas
properties.
    Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct
owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly
owned properties.
    In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's
existing debt, Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr
revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the
venture's development costs, National Fuel Gas said.
    It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets
not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new
corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the
new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will
receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange
for their claims against the company.

<TITLE>U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to
measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not
show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.
    The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options
involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals
agreed in January between the two central banks to make
commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar
standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.
    It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks
have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.
    The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.
    "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate
capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other
hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital
requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And
U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."
     At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the
so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a
currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its
potential change in value due to currency or interest rate
fluctuations until the contract matures.
    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance
sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of
five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the
quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the
contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the
plans showed.
    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would
not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.
    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk
weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.
And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national
government agencies, the proposals showed.
    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot
foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and
options exchanges.
    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England
were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate
multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single
agreement to create one single payments stream.
    It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain
circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their
further development and implementation," and said some of the
current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

said its board left the quarterly dividend unchanged at 37-1/2

    The trust, which has raised its quarterly dividend
frequently in the past two years and in the first quarter in
both years, said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has limited its
flexibility on dividends, and trustees will now consider the
appropriateness of any dividend increases only during the later
quarters of the year.

    Financing from the compensatory facility is meant to offset

    The government will also receive 85 mln SDRs under a new

<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Poland's winter wheat is likely to
survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be
known until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.
    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive
ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman
Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.
    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly
melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should
not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be
damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots
may be exposed to night frosts.

<TITLE>U.S. PRESENTS MOSCOW WITH DRAFT MISSILE TREATY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States today handed Soviet
arms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate all
superpower medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and slash
such weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side.
    Maynard Glitman, who heads the American team discussing
medium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "a
full treaty text," was now on the negotiating table.
    The proposal responds to a new Soviet offer to abolish
"Euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forces
elsewhere announced by Mikhail Gorbachev last Saturday.
    The developments have been described by many disarmament
experts as the first real opening for a superpower accord since
they resumed arms control talks in March 1985.
    Glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a half
hour meeting at the American diplomatic mission with the Soviet
team on medium-range missiles headed by Lem Masterkov.
    He told reporters: "It is a complete document. It has to be
because we want precision. We don't want any ambiguities."
    The draft called for elimination - removal and destruction
- of all superpower medium-range missiles in Europe over five
years and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomic
warheads on each side, Glitman added.
    In Europe, this includes 270 Soviet triple-warhead SS-20's
and 316 single-warhead U.S. Pershing-2 and cruise missiles.

<TITLE>GREAT NORTHERN NEKOOSA &lt;GNN> ANNOUNCES SPLIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Great Northern Nekoosa Corp
said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common
stock split.
    The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners
at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's
Great Southern Paper division operations.
    In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the
shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the
authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the
company said.
    The company said it will propose an increase in its
dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June
payment.
    The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts
per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate
of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a
dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct
higher than the current rate.
    The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct
last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock
split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.
    As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN
common stock outstanding, according to the company.

<TITLE>CONED &lt;ED> AGREES TO CUT RATES, WRITE OFF DEBITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc
has agreed to reduce its rates 3.1 pct next month and write-off
50 mln dlrs of deferred debits, New York Governor Mario M.
Cuomo said.
    He told a press conference the 132.5 mln dlr reduction in
annual rates, along with the removal of 50 mln dlrs in fuel
charges from base rates are part of an agreement which will
reduce the utility's base electric rates by about 500 mln dlrs
per year over the next three years and bar any rate increases
until at least April 1990.
    Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which must
be approved by the State Public Service Commission, was
negotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, Public
Servcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General,
the City of New York and several other parties.
    He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctric
rate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years.
    As a result of an earlier stipulation, we have already had
a four year freeze on Con Edison's base electric rates since
March 1983," he added.
    Con Edison said the agreement reflects reduced federal
taxes and lower interest rates.
    The utility said another factor includes improved economic
conditions in the New York City area, which led to increased
sales.
    It pointed out "declining fuel costs have resulted in an
average 10 pct decrease in our customers' bills since 1984."

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Failure of talks on re-establishing
International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week
may put political pressure on the United States, particularly
the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is
unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by
"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.
    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head
of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his
return from London that the United States is willing to resume
the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.
    Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in
discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and
any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of
establishing an objective method of setting quotas.
    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,
proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated
by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable
production and verified stocks, while large producers led by
Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of
shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the
market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.
    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support
legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.
customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply
with any future coffee quotas.
    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the
coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London
talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."
    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee
policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market
offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,
to soften the consumer position.
    "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will
kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and
consumers," said one U.S. official.
    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said
Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few
months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other
countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers
who differed with the major producers in London.
    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin
American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the
U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in
the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.
officials said.
    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee
policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from
politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.
officials said.
    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia
at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on
objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica
joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to
objective criteria.
    There is a strong feeling among some in the State
Department that the United States should continue to support
the splinter group of producers who have taken the
politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective
criteria question, U.S. officials said.
    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be
some pressure to reassess positions.
    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the
Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on
the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.
    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations
to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.
    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at
times qualified and there is some concern that the European
Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to
producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and
other African producers during the talks.
    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,
although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.
    While political manuevering by small producers and
consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the
key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.
    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the
failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from
Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

<TITLE>IBM &lt;IBM> DEMONSTRATES NEW CHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Business
Machines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer
chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light
into electrical signals that translate into computer language.
    IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip
reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second.
    The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical
signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits.
    IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient
in turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems to
be an ideal material for the light-based computer
communications expected to be widely used in the future.
    The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination
of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector
and transistor circuitry close together.
    Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the
receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and
distortion, it said.

<TITLE>TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Torrential rains throughout
Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse
grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to
soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or
May.
    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum
crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.
    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,
with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,
between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10
and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40
mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.
    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.
    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.
    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa
Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.
    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was
estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to
seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11
mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6
mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,
or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to
official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
pct of total planted area.
    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure
of 3.14 mln hectares.
    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln
and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and
41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to
1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln
hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and
3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2
million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.
    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a
record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of
11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3
mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures
put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.
    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.
    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is
expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to
13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he
intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers
of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92
pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they
planted.
    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that
applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was
supported by the Reagan administration and would save
approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn
payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.
    The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the
Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of
Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House
Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.
Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency
payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not
to plant under the decoupling scheme.
    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market
prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished
deficiency payments.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as
possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter
further before deciding how he would vote on it.

<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro
met his Swiss counterpart Otto Stich, Swiss Economics Minister
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and National Bank President Pierre
Languetin on the fourth leg of a tour to discuss his country's
debt problems.
    Funaro told reporters his trip, which has already taken him
to London, Paris and Bonn, was aimed at explaining his
country's stance to governments. Talks with commercial banks
will take place at a later date.
    Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end
Brazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy.
    Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to
its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest
recession in his country's history, he added.
    He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more
flexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks and
it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.
    A Swiss official said the Brazilian delegation had made no
demands.
    Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it was
unclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to Brazil
first.

set up an arbitration panel to rule on objections by Canada and
the European Community to a customs user fee imposed by the
U.S. Government, a GATT spokesman said.
    Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade) council meeting that the fee, which imposes a tax on
an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, is
illegal under GATT rules.
    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed by
the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, does
not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many
other countries.
    Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine
the dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it.
    In another development, Hong Kong, supported by a large
number of developing countries, attacked the "textile and
apparel trade act of 1987" introduced in the U.S. Congress last
February 19.
    Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is
"blatantly protectionist." He added there is "almost nothing about
the bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent with
either the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)."
    If the bill were to be passed by Congress, Cartland said "it
would forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation of
world trade in textiles."
    GATT's council also decided to set up a working party to
study China's application for full GATT membership. The group
is due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15.

<DATELINE>    DOTHAN, Ala., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Healthcare Inc said it has
received a waiver until May 26 of its technical defaults under
covenants of its bank credit agreement.
    The company said that under an amendment to the credit
agreement, its line of credit has been cut to 125 mln dlrs due
to reduced requirements for acquisition financing, interest on
all borrowings has been increased and National Healthcare has
agreed to provide additional collateral.
    It said the banks have advanced it another six mln dlrs for
working capital, bringing the total borrowed against the line
to about 120 mln dlrs.
    National Healthcare said that during the waiver period it
intends to seek more permanent modifications to covenants of
the bank credit agreement.

regime agreed last night is too complicated and may destabilise
prices, Abele Kuypers, secretary of the dairy section of the
Dutch farmers' organisation Landbouwschap said.
    He welcomed the decision to write off existing stocks of
butter and skimmed milk powder and agreed there should be some
reduction of pressure on stores but said the Landbouwschap was
unhappy at the mechanism for limiting sales to intervention
except when prices fall too far.
    But Harm Schelhaas, chairman of the Milk Commodity Board,
was less worried by the new dairy regime. Dutch milk output
will fall by up to six pct this year due to the new regime, but
cheese output should rise, he said.

    Traders said at least one other international trader made a

total Indian purchases to at least six cargoes with traders
having options to sell another four.

<TITLE>TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
Organisation said.
    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
wholesale index last year.
    This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the
economic management will have to be careful," he said.
    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
which is central to the government's economic planning, said
Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
    "We must alleviate the current account substantially to
sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
over the last five years," he added.
    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
would look better if inflation were lower and the current
account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
    "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
improvement in the current account deficit," he said.
    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
also to blame for the high deficits.
    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
    "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he
said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
5.6 pct in 1986.
    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
exports, and production incentives were being considered.
    "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
local private capital come more into play as far as
manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.
    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
currency is only partially convertible.

<TITLE>ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MICHAEL FITZPATRICK, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Drilling for oil in California is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year," Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"
Guerard said.

<TITLE>REAGAN DENOUNCES REPORTS OF WIFE'S ROLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan angrily denounced
press reports that his wife, Nancy, is running the government
as "despicable fiction."
    He said the reports had "touched a nerve."
    Reagan made the comments at a photo session with William
Webster, his nominee as head of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
    The president and Mrs Reagan celebrate their 35th wedding
anniversary today as Reagan prepares to make an address to the
nation on the Iran-contra scandal tonight.
    When a reporter asked about Mrs Reagan's role in
government, Reagan replied: "I think this is being bandied by
the press. That is fiction and I think it is despicable
fiction.  And a lot of people ought to be ashamed of
themselves."
    Pressed for further comment, Reagan said, "The idea that she
is involved in governmental decisions and so forth... and being
a kind of a dragon lady, there is nothing to that."
    Reagan flatly denied that that his wife had had a role in
the departure from the White House last Friday of Reagan's
chief of staff, Donald Regan, as has been widely reported.
    Regan's successor, former senator Howard Baker, was in the
room as Reagan made his comments.

<TITLE>IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government daily Izvestia said a
considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded
and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will
not be easy to fulfil.
    Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable
part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates
extra effort in the fields in spring."
    The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of
winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.
    A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has
said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct
of the total winter crop and would be the second highest
winterkill in 10 years.
    "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes
of grain is not simple," Izvestia said.
    This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large
parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the
Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as
minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA'S CREDITORS SAID DIVIDED OVER DEBT ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank director Daniel Marx
said Argentina's creditor banks were divided on the country's
request for rescheduling its foreign debt.
    "There are difficulties (among the banks) to reach an
agreement and find a unanimous decision," Marx told a local
radio station in a telephone interview from New York.
    Argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its
50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in
interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said.
    Marx is in New York with Argentina's debt negotiating team
holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee.
    Marx said the talks should not drag on. "If Venezuela and
Mexico have concluded their negotiations, we want to end (ours)
in a reasonable manner and as soon as possible," he said.
    Economy ministry sources said the steering committee was
expected today to make a counter-proposal not unlike that made
by Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn at the start of the
talks between the two parties.
    Argentina is seeking a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four
pct growth targets in 1987. It also wants lower interest rates
on its foreign debt. The United States said last week it would
support a 500 mln dlr bridging loan for Argentina.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted
alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and
1985 from a federal conservation requirement.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore
equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm
program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without
interrupting the plantings with a row crop.
    An official from a leading conservation group, who asked
not to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunate
first action" because it could lead to the exemption of
potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations,
established under the 1985 farm bill.

<DATELINE>    GREAT NECK, N.Y., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>AVX Corp said it has entered a
two mln dlr settlement with the U.S. government and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to pay for damage claims against
the company for contaminating the New Bedford, Mass., harbor
with polychloride biphenyls (PCBs).
    As part of the agreement, AVX said the government and
Massachusetts have agreed to release it from further
liabilities for polluting the harbor.
    AVX said it has fully provided for the settlement's cost in
its 1986 financial statements.
    AVX, a multilayer ceramic capacitor producer, said the
government had estimated damages to the harbor at about 50 mln
dlrs.
    But, it added, the government, the state and the
Environmental Protection Agency are still awaiting the
completion of studies to determine whether they will recommend
a cleanup and what it will cost.
    The studies will be completed next year, AVX added.
    AVX said it is one of five defendents involved in the
pollution litigation.
    AVX said it is also engaged in litigation with its insurers
to determine the applicability and the amount of coverage
available to indemnify the company for payment of the the two
mln dlr settlement or its share of the cleanup, if any.

<TITLE>OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street traders said the stock of
Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of
Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.
    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
for control of the whole company.
    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
rumor.
    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are
not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
strategic plans," he said.
    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.
    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>French soft wheat exports to other
European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in
the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January
compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French
Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said.
    According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were
Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86
period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the
Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes
(919,337).
    British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this
period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and
January 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800
tonnes, ONIC figures showed.
    But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes
against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal
bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.
    ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community
countries was due to British competition.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The size of French 1986/87 carryover
barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
intervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put into
intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
1985/86.
    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

<TITLE>S. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4, - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs
trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the
country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.
companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.
     He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and
denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.
    Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year
South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a
record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr
deficit with Japan.
    Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission
is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.
companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred
purchases from Japanese sources."
    Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are
"mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."
    He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.
agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in
that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of
cotton" from the U.S.
    He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American
market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,"
considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and
spends six pct of its gross national product on defense.

<DATELINE>    Detroit, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Range Rover of North America Inc, a
subsidiary of the British Land Rover Group, said it would begin
selling the luxury utility vehicles in the United States March
16 at a suggested retail price of 30,825 dlrs.
    Range Rover executives told Reuters after a press
conference they expect to generate 80 mln dlrs in revenues this
year, but that the U.S. venture is not expected to become
profitable until 1989.
    The executives said they expect to sell 3,000 of the
vehicles this year from an initial network of 37 dealers, which
will be gradually expanded to 65 within a year.
    Range Rover's project, aimed at buyers with household
incomes above 100,000 dlrs annually, is the culmination of a
four-year effort by Land Rover Group to introduce the
British-build vehicle in the U.S. market.
    The executives said the only option to be offered with the
vehicles will be a leather upholstery package priced at 1,025
dlrs.

<TITLE>CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINNIPEG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Wheat Board has advised
the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
price drops but said it would not be good news for western
Canadian grain growers.
    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting
pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."
    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
    But federal agricultural officials have already warned
farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

<TITLE>GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling GATT Council deferred a
decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese
agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
    David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties
would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of
resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,
officially known as semiconductors.
    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.
    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave
U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.
    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,
Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC
complaint during the heated Council debate.
    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael
Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were
unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp staged an explosive
rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
stiff competition and erosion of market share.
    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing
shareholder value."
    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
recapture lost market share.
    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
good performance expected from new car models.
    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
repurchase program is not a positive.
    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will
have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
should settle back down to around 76, he added.
    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are
not selling as well as their competitors," he said.
    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February
sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
improvement in coming months.
    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
analysts said. The numbers include imports.
    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
earnings surprise in the winds," he said.
    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more
concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.
    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
market share.
    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around
35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
said results will not improve until 1988.
    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
transition year for GM," he said.
    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they
earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
important."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Healthy growth in corporate profits and in
consumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its
hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the
core, economists polled by Reuters said.
    Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace
exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between
corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative
economic model promises little but slower growth, they said.
    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn
will cut sales and further reduce profits.
    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved
terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic
demand grow steadily.
    However, this would happen only if household spending
increased in line with the value of real financial assets due
to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as
profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from
exports.
    "No clear sign of such developments has so far been
evidenced," the central bank said.
    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth
will be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved
sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips
and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct
while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price
margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies
did not pass that advantage on to the consumer.
    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the
fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in
consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of
trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.
    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will
protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek
more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic
competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.
Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.
    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren
confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.
    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost
80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production
volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,
said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.
    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting
unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors
(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down
wages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears
unemployment could soon double from three pct now.
    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt
sales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual
financial security could be even more damaging.
    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what
amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to
buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.
    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied
bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.
    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than
the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a
poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the
resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,
and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.
    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80
pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly
ageing population and minimal social security and its workers
fear poverty in their old age.
    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's
reflationary strategies are severely limited.
    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small
supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive
without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less
than excited at the results.
    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.
    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically
impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate
at only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.
    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some
kind of deposit, official figures show.
    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while
firms are planning cuts in capital investment.
    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land
prices are the only current results of high liquidity.
    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political
analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big
election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price
inflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a
sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Offshore oil industry has
suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not
sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy
Alick Buchanan-Smith said.
    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been
most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy
committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still
spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.
    He added that a report by the manpower services committee
which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should
be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.
    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of
8.50
dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the
previous November.
    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last
December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15
dlrs.
    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting
OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as
well as an oil-producing nation.

<TITLE>TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
    In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
    Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told
journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
subsidiary before stock depreciation.
    CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
billion loss in 1985.
    But its net loss last year, taking account of that
depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
    In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent
distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud
said.
    The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
francs, he said.
    Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a
good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."

    He said the objective of SEMATECH, a non profit

vital to the U.S. economy and national security.
    The plan was for SEMATECH to establish a facility at
various manufacturers and equipment suppliers to pioneer
advanced manufacturing techniques for semiconductors.

<TITLE>TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AUSTIN, Texas, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Railroad Commissioner James
Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent
said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way."
    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria
blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last
week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export
quotas.
    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible
than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political
factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria
told Reuters in an interview.
    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other
for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export
quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful
outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent
attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it
impossible.
    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria
said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and
political consequences, not necessarily for a country like
Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for
some African countries.
    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively
high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.
    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500
mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which
traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export
revenue.
    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400
mln dlrs from 1986.
    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the
start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln
bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.

<TITLE>PACTEL &lt;PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, march 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald
Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
    Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
spending will be internally financed.
    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
Bell operating company.
    In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
modernization costs.
    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
    "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he
would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
company would make a decision soon on participating.
    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
    "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm
not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
business."
    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
alliances with other companies.
    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration,"
he said.

<TITLE>SENATE COMMITTEE ISSUES REVISED BANK BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate Banking Committee has
issued a revised draft bank regulation bill which would permit
so-called non-bank banks to continue all their activities in
progress as of March 5, 1987.
    The bill, which the committee is scheduled to consider
tomorrow, would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new
activities after March 5, increase the number of their
locations or cross-market products or services not permissible
for bank holding companies.
    The bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank
securities or insurance activities.
    The bill would establish a financing corporation to raise
7.5 billion dlrs for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp and give federal regulators more power to arrange
out-of-state mergers for failed or failing banks with 500 mln
dlrs or more in assets.
    Committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, had wanted to
ban all non-bank bank activities started after July 1, 1983,
but opposition from other committee members forced him to
revise the legislation.
    The House Banking committee is also considering bank
regulation legislation, but is waiting for the Senate to act.

<TITLE>NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking
banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion
them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency
swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.
    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by
the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said
that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside
reserves twice for the same risk.
    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the
proposals.
    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially
significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume
of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in
eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that
about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the
International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of
Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association
has no comment and will study the proposals.
    "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrick
de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley
and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be
required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
    "The potential risk factors are very large relative to what
we had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.
"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
have 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph).
    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a
competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
costs on to customers.
    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal
Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the
proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that
Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new
capital rules.
     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
counterparty against each other.
    The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize that
such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
credit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
     "One problem is that there has never been a major default
in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap
arrangements will really stand up in court," said one bank
official.

<TITLE>SPEAKES SAYS HE, REAGAN MISLED PUBLIC UNWITTINGLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said he and President Reagan misled the public
unintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because they
themselves were misled by others.
    In a televised interview, Speakes was contrasting the
defensive, much-criticized efforts Reagan made in early
attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he
expected when the president addressed the nation tonight.
    "When we went into those press conferences and that
nationwide address in November right after the (Iran) story
broke, the president did not have the proper information,"
Speakes said.
    "And that's why we were misled. And consequently, the
president and I misled the public, to a certain extent."
    "We were badly served by the people that were involved in
the Iranian crisis and running the show."
    Asked whom he meant, Speakes said former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter;
and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North.
    Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of
events "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts
..."
    McFarlane has said that he, North and Poindexter had
doctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimize
Reagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as part
of an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 news
conference.

<TITLE>BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive
use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also
noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor John Crow last month.
    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, Bouey said.
    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in March, 1986.
    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian
Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and
the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the
advances.

<DATELINE>    GREENWICH, Conn., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dynamics Corp of America said
it has reached an agreement with CTS Corp resolving all
differences between the two companies.
    It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board
committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all
of CTS.
    Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding
stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more
than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the
company's 1987 annual meeting.
    Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders
vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying
Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated
costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common
at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the
outstanding stock.
    Dynamics said the price of stock under the option,
exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price
for the stock for the five days ending March two.
    Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the
additional title of President. Former President Robert D.
Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial
Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek.
    Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven
members for eight with the remaining four members of the
current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new
directors.

<TITLE>CME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,
directors have postponed action on a membership petition
calling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandner
told Reuters.
    Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular
board meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions of
a special committee that has been studying trading conditions
in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six
months.
    "We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said.
    Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findings
of the special S and P committee, which is considering some
type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures.
    Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange
member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own
account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity
for traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at more
favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner
said he expects the special committee to report its findings
late next week and the board to act when those findings are
presented.
    In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a
ban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already
unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P
500 futures at a prior meeting.
    The change was withheld, however, at the request of the
special committee after a study was released and the committee
felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively,
Sandner said.
    Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on
dual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to
a ban on dual trading."
    Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special
study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500
futures and options on futures.
    In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is
also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for
electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures
and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P
trading pit, Melamed said.
    Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special
committee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are
usually approved by the exchange board of directors.

<TITLE>RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects for renewal of the
five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this
point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.
    The current trade imbalance between the United States and
the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased
world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement
next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.
    The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.
    Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than
when the first agreement was signed in 1975.
    Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have
indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as
attractive for both sides as it once was.
    "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement,
but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with
prices," Melnikov said.
    "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future
about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will
happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said.
    Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet
government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal
of the agreement.
    "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or
ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp's Chrysler Motors Corp

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> MAKES MERGER OFFER FOR USAIR &lt;U></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines said it has
proposed a cash merger of USAir Group with TWA in which the
holders of USAir common would receive 52 dlrs in cash in
exchange for their stock.
    TWA said the offer was made in a letter to Edmin Colodny,
chairman and president of USAir.
    TWA said, however, that if the negotiated deal is not
acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's
shareholders for up to 51 pct of USAir's outstanding stock, to
be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's
offer.
    TWA said it is filing an application with the Department of
Transportation seeking approval of the merger as well as an
application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its
purchase of up to 51 pct of USAir common and the deposit of the
stock in a voting trust, pending DOT approval.
    TWA said that in respect to USAir's recent offer for
Piedmont Aviation &lt;PIE> it believes that USAir's shareholders
would prefer a cash merger proposal for USAir over its proposed
acquisition of Piedmont.
    TWA said, however, it also would be interested in
discussing a three way deal among USAir, Piedmont and TWA.
    TWA said the merger is subject to the USAir board redeeming
the preferred stock purchase rights (the poison pill) issued to
shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a
majority of the outstanding common stock is required to approve
its proposed move.
    Additionally, TWA said it would need a satisfactory due
diligence review of USAir.
    TWA said it has not yet had an opportunity to obtain the
necessary financing for the deal, but added it is confident
that it will get it.

<TITLE>REAGAN IRAN SPEECH SAID TO ADMIT NEED FOR CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, fighting to recover
politically from the Iran-contra scandal, plans to acknowledge
in a critical speech to the nation tonight he needs to change
his ways, administration officials said.
    "It will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say he
accepts the need for change," said an official who asked not to
be identified. "I think the president wants to give his side of
the story."
    The official said Reagan would tell the public what he is
doing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorching
Tower commission report on the origins of the scandal.
    It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of many
of his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policy
was wrong and he personally made some mistakes.
    Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would say
he erred, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters, "His views are intensely personal and I won't give
you any advance on what he intends to say in that area."
    He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length and
that Reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalized
White House that will pursue an active foreign policy."
    "The president will discuss the Tower board report and its
recommendations. He'll focus on changes he's making in the
structure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goals
for the next two years," the spokesman said.
    To date, Reagan has defended his decision to sell arms to
Iran and conceded only there were errors in implementation.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said tonight's speech
might be Reagan's last chance to repair his presidency.
    "It's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us on
another course. It's hard to do that, he probably won't be able
to do it," Dole told reporters.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Duff and Phelps lowered the ratings
assigned to Public Service Electric and Gas Company's fixed
income securities valued at a total of 3.44 billion dlrs.
    The company's 2.61 billion dlrs in first mortgage bonds
were downgraded to DP-4 (low AA) from DP-3 (middle AA). The
ratings on its debentures and preferred stock valued at 213 mln
and 619 mln dlrs, respectively, were lowered to DP-5 (high A)
from DP-4.
    Duff and Phelps said the utility's debt ratings were
lowered because of the recent negative rate order for its Hope
Creel nuclear plants.
    "This order included highly stringent performance standards
for the company's five nuclear plants," the ratings agency
said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The former chairman of Peoples National
Bank of Rockland County, N.Y., pleaded guilty to charges of
bribery and income tax evasion.
    Leonard Slutsky, 41, faces up to five years in prison on
each of two counts of bank bribery and tax evasion. He could
also be fined up to 745,000 dlrs.
    In his guilty plea before Judge Charles Brieant of the

<TITLE>MORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressmen from beef producing
states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry 
urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea
to open up their markets to imports of beef.
    Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock
issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should
push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea.
Daub was joined by several other lawmakers.
    U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied
"we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She
noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior
Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter
and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in
April for discussions on farm trade issues.
    Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400
tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned
beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S.
pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.
    In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs
for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress,
administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and
united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and
that we expect them to open their markets."

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the U.S. House
subcommittee on dairy, livestock and poultry issues, Rep.
Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.), said it is likely the U.S. dairy
support price will be cut next year.
    "It looks like the price cut may take place," Stenholm said
at a hearing today on dairy issues.
    Under the 1985 farm bill, the Agriculture Secretary can
lower the U.S. milk price support to 10.60 dlrs per cwt from
the current 11.35 dlrs if government purchases of dairy
products are forecast to exceed five billion lbs in 1988.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department forecasts government
purchases of dairy products will total six to seven billion lbs
in fiscal 1987, but says the level of purchases beyond 1987
will depend on the production decisions of dairy farmers.

<TITLE>MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill
its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement
depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official
told Reuters.
    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement
if the United States does not want to offer us grain at
competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.
    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the
United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive
prices," he said in an interview.
    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the
agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at
prevailing market prices.
    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.
    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of
commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market
price prevailing for these products at the time of
purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."
    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union
definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the
United States ready to supply this?" he said.
    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has
been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he
confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices
remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.
    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.
    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,
then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the
United States to decide how these competitive prices will be
offered," he said.
    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets
was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,
U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

<TITLE>LEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Key tax and budget lawmakers
Wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new
securities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street
and put pressure on brokerage stocks.
    Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut
federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target
of 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax
be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues.
    The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways
and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would
tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5
percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.
    Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early
to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities
transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by
congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.
    The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he
is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan
maintains his staunch opposition.
    "First we've got to decide whether to raise additional
revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At
this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early,"
Rostenkowski said in a statement.
    He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting
Tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source
said. The idea was presented only as something that might or
might not be valuable, he said.
    House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was
another option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed
to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said.
   The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend
specific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee
will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in
1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision
on how the taxes will be raised.
    The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of
revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the
deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.
    But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive
securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and
there were uncertainties about the details of the tax.
    Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so
far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the
budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no
decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said.
    At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a
general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that
are guaranteed to anger those who must pay.
    "We could just do all of them," one congressional source said
of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil
import fee and others.

<TITLE>AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The directors of the American Farm
Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday
to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without
alterations.
    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"
said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been
in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment
there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining
the legislation.
    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm
bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being
advanced," Kleckner said.
    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as
he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans
competitive in the world market.
    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be
eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK
certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and
the new loan rate.
    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency
payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat
because of adverse weather.

<TITLE>U.S. SEMICONDUCTOR PLAN RAISES ANTITRUST ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A plan by U.S. semiconductor firms to
cooperate in a manufacturing facility to compete with firms in
Japan could conflict with anti-monopoly law, the plan's backers
said.
    The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a news
conference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH to
build an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant.
    Asked whether U.S. antitrust regulators might object,
Charles Sporck, president of National Semiconductor Corp, said,
"That is a possibility."
    Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest in
the project but he declined to estimate how much would be
sought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH would
require.
    Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational plan
ready by June 1.
    Then it will search for a site for the manufacturing
facility and an executive to head up the consortium.
    The consortium could be operating by the end of the year,
and the facility working in 18 months, he said.
    International Business Machines Corp hopes to participate
in the effort, Paul Low, an IBM executive, said.
    He said the project suppliers of raw materials and others
vital to the semiconductor industry, such as toolmakers, would
be invited to participate.
    Sporck said no decision was made on what product would be
produced, stressing that the emphasis was on developing
technology and sharing that with firms which belonged to
SEMATECH. Other aspects were still undecided, such as whether a
Japanese firm with a facility in the United States would be
allowed to participate, he said.

Republican members who wanted more time to look over a revised 
draft version of the bill which was just introduced.
    That version of the bill would allow non-bank banks to
continue activities in operation as of March 5, but would
prohibit them from starting other financial services.
    The previous draft bill would have banned non-bank bank
activities started after July 1, 1983.

<TITLE>VIACOM &lt;VIA> MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sumner Redstone, president of National
Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to
wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
Inc in 60 to 90 days.
    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
    "We've had counsel working for some time in every region
where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters
in a telephone interview.
    Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very
closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking
approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
systems since September when its management group first
advanced a buyout plan.
    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
a defintive merger agreement with National.
    National is a family business which operates a chain of
movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion
picture on any pay channel," Redstone said.
    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will
be a company expense," Redstone said.
    He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries
from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr
financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.
    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National
but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.

<TITLE>BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior British official said that
protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
global trading system.
    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."
    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
of Congress.
    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he
said.
    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
avoid trade disputes.
    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he
said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another
occasion."
    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in
Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
of unilaterally imposed deadlines."
    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States
must therefore learn to manage their relations better."
    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be
interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
to happen to the rest of us?"

way to improve the U.S. trade picture.
    Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee
which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, "In my
judgment economic factors justify a continued decline."
    Asked by a committee member if he expected a further
decline, and how much, Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean
currencies should be adjusted to reflect "positive factors" in
their economies.

revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the
previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of
sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline
seven pct from 1985/86.
    Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at
837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down
five pct from the previous season, while cane output is
projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously
forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.

<TITLE>UAW, AMC &lt;AMO> SET NEW LABOR TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers and American
Motors Corp agreed to resume talks on a new labor contract for
the company's threatened Kenosha, Wisc. assembly plant despite
a breakdown in talks last weekend, UAW vice-president Marc
Stepp said.
    Stepp told reporters that issues which caused the talks to
break off are being discussed between the two sides and that a
main table bargaining session has been scheduled Friday in
Milwaukee.
    France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault has a
controlling stake in American Motors.
    Stepp said the union intends "to exert full efforts" to
reach an agreement that would keep the plant in operation past
1989, when AMC has said production will end unless the UAW
grants concessions on labor costs.
    The UAW leader said the company and the union agreed in
principle in 1985 to pattern a future contract covering some
6,000 Kenosha workers after lower-cost UAW contracts covering
Mazda Motor Corp's new U.S. plant in Michigan and the New
United Motor plant in California operated by Toyota.
    Stepp said there is such deep hostility between the company
and union locals in Milwaukee and Kenosha that communication
between them is very difficult.
    But he said it is possible to reach agreement on a new
contract to save the jobs of UAW members at AMC's Wisconsin
operations despite the impasse.
    AMC has said it will resume talks, but only for 24 hours to
ascertain whether the union was willing to agree to the
concessions it wants.
    The Kenosha plant builds AMC's Renault cars and a line of
Chrysler Corp &lt;C> vehicles under a contract assembly deal.

<TITLE>DOME&lt;DMP> DEBT PLAN LIKELY CIRCULATED NEXT WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's plan to reschedule
debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs will likely be
detailed to a group of 56 major creditors on Monday or Tuesday
next week, a company spokesman said.
    Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's
debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from
discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told
Reuters in response to an inquiry.
    Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3
billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to
implement the debt plan now under negotiation.
    Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement
outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following
release of the plan to lenders.
    Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt
plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle
from creditors prior to June 30.
    The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a
substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an
interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with
cash flow generated by assets backing the loans.
    Annesley also said there was no change in the status of
legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are
seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt.
    Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss
francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss
franc denominated debt in default.
    Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a
Swiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.
    Dome Petroleum's 1986 fourth quarter and year earnings will
likely be reported at the end of March, he also said.

    He said the SEC seemed to have stopped demanding such
disclosures, which are required by securities laws.
    "In the wake of the foreign bribery cases in the 1970s, the
SEC instituted a vigorous program of self-policing, using
external auditors, investigators, and counsel. It should do so
again," Dingell said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc complicated
the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
Piedmont and USAir.
    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA
might just be putting up a trial balloon."
    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of Piedmont.
    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.
    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement," said one executive at another major airline.
    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
system.
    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

<TITLE>USDA TRANSMITS FARM PROPOSALS TO CONGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration officially
submitted to Congress its proposals to cut back U.S. farmers'
income deficiency payments, decouple planting decisions from
income support levels and accelerate reductions in loan rates,
Senate staff said.
    The recommendations, first outlined last January in
President Reagan's fiscal 1988 budget blueprint, were
transmitted to both houses of Congress as legislative
proposals.
    It was not clear which lawmakers might introduce the
measures.
    The most controversial proposal in the package would make
10 pct annual reductions in target prices for major
commodities. A number of legislators have predicted the target
price proposal will not move in Congress.
    The package also would offer the so-called 0/92 option to
producers of 1987-90 crops and raise the annual permissible
reduction in loan rates to 10 pct from 5 pct.
    Under 0/92, a producer is guaranteed at least 92 pct of his
deficiency payment regardless of how much he plants.

<TITLE>YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade
issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade.
    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China
could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.
    "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member
of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations
subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.
    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of
China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final
touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    
The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational
group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,
would offer both potential export markets and potential
competition for U.S. industries, he said.
    "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.
business," Yeutter said.
    "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he
added.

    Pan Am also said it has asked its labor unions to help

"Management is leading the way, but with 40 pct of our
operating expenses represented by labor costs, we must have the
cooperation of our labor unions if we are to make additional
improvements to our 1987 operating plan."
    Shugrue asked Pan Am's unions to begin negotiations on the
pay cuts immediately.

<TITLE>RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The failure of talks to introduce
new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee
Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil
having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President
of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon
said.
    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25
pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable
as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.
    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"
Calmon added.
    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,
Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln
bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,
leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.
    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was
better than such a quota reduction," he added.
    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green
coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe
drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under
10 mln bags.
    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of
which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest
this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.
    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last
year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe
it was higher than this.

cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is scheduled to meet
Friday to discuss, among other issues, the status of
agricultural legislation, administration officials said.
    The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture
Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on
the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought
before the council, the officials said.
    Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make
a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials
have said the matter is not under active consideration.
    USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative
proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and
speed up loan rate reductions.

<TITLE>U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A meeting among government agencies
today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to
a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European
Community, U.S. trade officials said.
    Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at
a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials
of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure
on EC member states.
    "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S.
trade official.
    One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to
member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels
proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great
cost."
    U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on
which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.
    "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade
official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on
its farm price package.
    Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters
the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the
vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said
"sometimes its better not to be specific."
    U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned
another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC
proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR SALES UP 6.7 PCT IN LATE FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of new cars by the U.S. auto
industry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of
a year ago, but industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> was an
exception with an eight pct drop.
    The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry
from weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car
manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month
from last year.
    GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months,
took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28
period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the
entire industry were depressed from the ending of major
marketing incentive campaigns.
    At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co &lt;F> said its car
sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> was up
11.3 pct.
    The industry leader's slide was even more marked for the
full month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February,
including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago.
    Industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars sold
in the seven selling days of late February represented a
seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the
556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate.
    Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars,
including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a
breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in
1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack of
widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather,
analysts said.
    GM sales vice-president C.N. "Bud" Moore said in a
statement that his company's sales "began their recovery from
the low point reached in January, and we expect the improvement
to continue in coming months."
    Anne Knight, automotive analyst for Paine Webber and Co,
told Reuters that GM's sales were weak, but added: "I think
sales will get better in the spring."
    "GM may make more production cuts in view of the weak
sales, but this may be a strike year so they might try to build
inventories," she said.
    In a further effort to revive sales, GM said its
Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Buick divisions would offer many of
their new car lines through April 30 with discount loan
packages at rates ranging from 3.9 pct for 24-month contracts
to 9.9 pct for 60-month deals as an alternative to cash
rebates.
    Among the smaller U.S.-based manufacturers, Japanese-owned
American Honda &lt;HMC> said its late February car sales rose 96.2
pct from last year while Japanese-owned Nissan &lt;NSANY> was up
35.9 pct.
    German-owned Volkswagen of America fell 42.5 pct, American
Motors Corp &lt;AMO> plunged 62.5 pct and Japan's Toyota &lt;TOYOY>
sold 1,082 domestic makes compared with none a year ago before
it started domestic production.
    Detroit's late February truck sales were generally positive
with GM up 10.9 pct, Ford up 48 pct, Chrysler gaining 46 pct
and AMC's jeep sales off 4.0 pct.
    Imported cars sales, released monthly, were estimated at
219,300 in February, a 0.4 pct rise from last year and 28.3 pct
of the overall car market. That was lower than January's 31.4
pct share but above the 26.3 pct share a year ago.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. Jack Kemp, a New York

impose a tax on stock transactions.
    In a statement Kemp called the tax "a money grab to permit
Democrats to begin another government spending spree."
    "I call upon President Reagan to signal immediately that he
will veto any tax increase on stock transfers," Kemp said. He
added that the tax would punish the 50 million stockholders.
    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, has asked
congressional tax analysts to look at a 0.25 to 0.5 pct tax on
stock trades along with other tax proposals to help reduce the
federal budget deficit.

<TITLE>CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he
expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming
year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of
1986.
    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference
following presentation of the central bank's annual report in
the House of Commons today.
    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,
particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth
quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic
product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.
    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that
inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy
and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's
inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.
    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound
despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in
debt plagued countries such as Brazil.
    "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I
think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told
reporters.

<TITLE>ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked
lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.
    The company said it would sell all of its businesses other
than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing
of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
outstanding debt with the proceeds.
    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional
lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be
converted to common stock of the restructured company.
    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and
preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting
dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in
a statement.
    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing
preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,
common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to
represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
terms of the plan cannot be reached."
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
would result from the restructuring.
    "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan
must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private
lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
would be made "at substantially reduced levels."
    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
and solid materials processing.
    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to
AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.
    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its
solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196
mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,
or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,
or 12.27 dlrs a share.
    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4
mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.

Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was
concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given
the dollar's decline in the last 18 months.
    "I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the
import side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he told
a House Appropriations subcommittee.
    Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not
generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods
and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating
competitive exports, he said.

<TITLE>FORMER TRW&lt;TRW> EMPLOYEE SAYS FIRM WAS UNETHICAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A former TRW Inc controller told a
Congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in
its defense contracts with the government.
    "It is my contention that the company called TRW is not ever
vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW only
pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits
their financial interests," Larry Eagleye said in testimony at a
House Oversight subcommittee hearing.
    Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor components
division in Cleveland.
    Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did not
understand why the Defense Department had taken no action
against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it
had substantially overcharged the government for military
aircraft parts.
    "In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department
Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books
and other problems in one of the company's divisions in
Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of
the federal government on various military aircraft parts,"
Dingell said.
    "For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRW
inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three
times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial
engine blade," Dingell said in a statement.
    Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against
TRW last year charging the company with overcharging the
government. The Justice Department later joined the suit.
    "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW,
I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management,
many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy and
ethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's
(1984) report to the government," he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PENTAGON DELAYS PLAN TO BUY EUROPEAN MISSILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Army has delayed plans to
buy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S.
ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters, Defense
Department officials said.
    The Army has been considering buying some British Rapier
missiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gap
partial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. York
Division Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985.
    Despite recent indications by the service that it intended
to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told Reuters a
final decision had been suspended because some Army officials
favored a more versatile gun-missile combination.
    The gun-missile combination would open the competition wide
to U.S. firms.
    "The missile option is on hold now and no decision has been
made," said one of the Pentagon official, who asked not to be
identified.
    "There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see
if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an
integrated system of our own," said another official.
    Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab said, however, that Ronald and
Rapier "are not out of the picture by a long shot."
    There has been strong sentiment in the Army to reject a
missile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gun
and missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle.
    Such a move would throw the competition wide open to U.S.
firms, including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Boeing Co &lt;BA>, FMC
Corp &lt;FMC> and Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML>.
    But some Pentagon officials have expressed fears that an
"off-the-shelf" gun-missile combination could not be fielded
quickly enough.
     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger canceled the Sgt. York
gun, made by Ford Motor Co &lt;F> Aerospace and Communications
Corp, after the Pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs on
the system and then decided it could not shoot down attack
helicopters at the proper range.
    The Army later expanded the division air defense concept,
announcing it would divide the system into five different
components for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billion
dlrs, including a missile and gun-system combination on a
tracked vehicle.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs
in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a
large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration
between national and international markets, the OECD said.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34
pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in
the relative importance of the instruments used in
international financing.
    Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and
euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing
rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for
floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.
    The OECD said another striking feature of international
capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of
lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,
which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.
    Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a
notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing
through the flotation of fixed-interest securities.
    This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new
techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.
    Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of
equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a
rapidly expanding market for euro-equities.
    A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers
was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing
operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger
debt management policies. Growing integration with national
markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on
international markets.
    It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market
for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten
issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to
traditional forms of bank lending.
    Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a
possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and
possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.
    It said many market participants saw little scope for a
further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in
the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.
    It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in
demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers
would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided
by the market for euro-commercial paper.
    "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market
will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from
lower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any major
advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would
require a significantly broader investor base.

<TITLE>NYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Bernice Napach, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trading in energy futures on the New
York Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next
five to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing
chairman Michel Marks.
    "Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous
period of transition that will last five to 10 years," Marks
said, adding that volume will soar, international participation
will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil
companies, and speculators will grow.
    Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when
board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman
of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.
    "The priority of the next 10 years is operational
efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product
development," said Marks.
    Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out
of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in
order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that
are already planned.
    Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by
the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined
products volume could soar to  100,000 contracts a day.
    Much of the increased activity will come from the
international sector, according to Marks. "That's a huge growth
area," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign
producer countries to foreign independent operators.
     He said it would be difficult to develop a futures
contract based on an internationally traded crude although he
previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.
    "Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude
besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said.
     Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on
an international product rather than an international crude
will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He
said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of
developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.
    Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the
major oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and
institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds,
and insurance companies, Marks said.
    "The commodities markets have become financial markets and
should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,"
Marks said.
    He said speculators will increase their share of the energy
futures markets in the coming years from the current  share of
about 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70
pct share.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Regal International Inc said it proposed
to submit a plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court under which it will acquire Bell Petroleum Services INc's
by paying out all of its creditors and issue one share for each
shares of Bell's stock.
    This proposal has been amended from a previously rejected
offer of .50 Regal share for each Bell share.
    Regal said its will pursue the acquisition without the
support of Bell's management.
    Bell Petroleum filed its Chapter 11 petition in November
1986 and has not, as yet, filed a plan of reorganization but
has only sought an order extending the exclusive order,
according to Regal.
    Bell Petroleum President Ed Runyan said the company is
evaluating Regal's latest offer and evaluating other
alternatives.
    Runyan said Bell is meeting tomorrow with another potential
suitor.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. oil demand as measured by
products supplied rose 2.1 pct in the four weeks ended February
27 to 16.39 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.05 mln in the
same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) said.
    In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.1 pct in
the period to 3.37 mln bpd from 3.44 mln a year earlier.
    Gasoline demand averaged 6.60 mln bpd, up 2.4 pct from 6.44
mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.47 mln bpd, up
1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said.
    Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln
bpd, down 8.7 pct from 9.18 mln a year ago, and gross daily
crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 4.11 mln
bpd, up 36.9 pct from three mln, the EIA said.
    Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd,
up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said.
    Year-to-date figures will not become available until March
26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987
becomes available, the agency said.

<TITLE>SECURITIES GROUP FAVORS NEW BANK POWER FREEZE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities Industry Association
endorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate Banking
Committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for
commercial banks.
    Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co,
told reporters his group, which mainly represents investment
banking firms, supported committee members who want the Federal
Reserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bank
holding companies seeking new powers.
    "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance
pending congressional review," Gerard said.     
    The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a
federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan
associations and prohibit new nonbank banks.
    Gerard said the securities association had no position on
nonbank banks.
    The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensive
study before changing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates
commercial and investment banking activities, Gerard said.
Until the study is completed, the Fed should not act on the
applications by Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust
New York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said.   
    The study was likely to show substantial benefits from
continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking,
he said.
    Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker
Jim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would
hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds
that invest in securities.
    "It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax
on the saver and investor," Gerard said.
    In addition, a U.S. tax would drive business from the
United States to other countries, he said.

<DATELINE>    Bogota, march 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>the sharp fall in international coffee
prices will not affect colombia's external credit situation,
finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters.
    "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and I hope the
foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"
he said.
    He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not
totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
colombia's financial state, which he described as sound.
    Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss
of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.
    The conservative party and the country's largest trade
union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following
the price drop.
    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have
rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt
of 13.6 billion dlrs.

    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council

    Robert White, Canada's deputy chief of delegation, replied
the law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservations
reasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel.

<TITLE>EXCHANGE BANK &lt;EXCG> SEES BANK INDUSTRY SHAKEOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opportunities for medium-sized banks to
compete in the face of the increasing centralization of the
financial services industry may be dwindling, according to John
Rau, president of the Exchange National Bank of Chicago.
    "We're going to see a continued shaking-out of the banking
industry," Rau told Reuters after a speech to securities
analysts and investment advisors.
    Rau said Exchange National Bank has concentrated its
resources on financial services for medium-sized Chicago and
Midwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-market
companies, and sales and trading of financial services.    
    "Most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost
consumer deposits for their income. We decided to move our
franchise into a less susceptible niche," Rau said.
    "Nichemanship is a very difficult thing, especially in
urban areas where inevitably banking franchises are mass-market
oriented," Rau said. "The odds are against other banks doing
what we have done."
    Exchange National Bank is the principal subsidiary of The
Exchange International Corp. With total assets of 1.9 billion
dlrs, it is Chicago's fifth largest bank. Net income totalled
10.2 mln dlrs or 1.10 dlrs a share in 1986, up from 7.7 mln
dlrs or one dlr a share in 1985.

<TITLE>SURINAM GOVERNMENT TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC CRISIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARAMARIBO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Surinam's military government opens a
four-day congress tomorrow to discuss the country's deepening
economic crisis, the official Surinam News Agency reported.
    Acting Prime Minister Jules Wijdenbosch will open the
meeting which is being attended by government officials,
political leaders and heads of labor unions.
    Surinam's economy has suffered a sharp downturn in recent
months as a result of guerrilla activities led by former
soldier Ronny Brunswijk, who is seeking to overthrow the
government of Commander Desi Bouterse.
    The guerrillas have forced the shutdown of most of
Surinam's vital bauxite and aluminum industry, creating a
foreign exchange crisis and food shortages.

<TITLE>IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jean-Loup Fievet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ivory Coast today predicted that the
present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the
recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in
London would not last long.
    Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer
nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an
oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis
Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be
obliged to restore their positions.
    "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he
told a news conference here at his return from the failed
London talks.
    Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in
London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the
lowest since 1982.
    Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs
(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by
Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the
slide on the world markets continues.
    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa
producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an
African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of
next month.
    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based
Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of
the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.
    "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said
without elaborating.
    "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked
on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile
market," he said.
    Questioned by journalists, the minister said President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his
government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed
by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.
    Last year, the West African nation announced that the
coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)
per kilo.
    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify
its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from
world market fluctuation.
    A communique read over the state-run television tonight
said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran
Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright
(economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.
    The Agriculture Minister also announced the government
decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln
dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.
    Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of
Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times
following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and
coffee.
    Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to
grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986,
according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.

and a 323 mln deficit a year earlier.
    The deficit on invisibles on unsmoothed figures eased to
215 mln dlrs from 248 mln, revised from 277 mln in December and
252 mln in January 1986.
    The smoothed deficit on invisibles fell to 226 mln from 237
mln, revised from 250 mln in December and 234 mln in the year
ago period.

<TITLE>CHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rally Wednesday in U.S. interest
rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a
three month trading range which signals a bullish chart
breakout, financial analysts said.
    In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign
that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may
be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts
said.
    "The market is paying more attention to the weakened state
of the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery.
    Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory
orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth
will be slow.
    Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the
Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production
figures also provided some support.
    "The domestic economies of the major trading partners of
the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be
forced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodative
U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First
Options of Chicago.
    Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade
deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major
industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.
    "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for
bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather
than translate those into their own currencies and suffer
exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"
Michael said.
    Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said
some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from
buying by Japanese interests.
    But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred
after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.
    "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist Leslie
Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bonds
close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways
pattern we've been in for the last three months."
    Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the
June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and
that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.
    Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance
will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still have
the April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearby
contract is 105-15/32.
    Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June
T-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106."
    Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed
from other technical indicators such as relative strength
indexes and short-term momentum indicators.
    "Without them, sustained strength is in question," Keefe
said.

Producers Board to write off 1.03 billion N.Z. Dlrs of debt
incurred on behalf of farmers under the Meat Price
Stabilisation Scheme, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.
    Douglas and Agriculture Minister Colin Moyle said in a
joint statement the agreement concludes one of the major
refinancing arrangements announced in the July 1986 budget,
which removed subsidies from the farming sector.
    The write-off applies to debt occurring prior to October
1985, when stabilisation payments for sheepmeat ceased under an
industry restructuring which allowed private marketing.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>REAGAN ADMITS IRAN ARMS OPERATION A MISTAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, fighting to regain
public confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal,
admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an
arms-for-hostages deal and, "It was a mistake."
    "When it came to managing the NSC (National Security
Council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its
previous track record," Reagan said in a television address to
the American people.
    "I have already begun correcting this," he added in his
prepared remarks.
    Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes
of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to
last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret
sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed
contra rebels in Nicaragua.
    Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he
waited for the truth to come out and admitted, "I've paid a
price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence."
    He said that a few months ago, he told the American people
he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert
operation.
    "My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true,
but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not," Reagan said.
    "There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a
mistake," he said.
    Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to
develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a
post-Khomeini government.
    "It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my
personal concern for the hostages spill over into the
geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.
    "I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that
I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan,"
he said.
    The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John
Tower, said Reagan's "intense compassion" for Americans being
held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an
unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy.
    It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know
or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal
activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, which
hatched the operation.
    Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's
recommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, "In fact,
I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in
even better order."
    He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican
leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped
Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress,
"especially on foreign and national security policies."
    He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci,
was rebuilding the national security staff "with proper
management discipline."
    Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now
consisted of new people.
    He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nominee
to head the CIA, "understands the meaning of 'rule of law'".
    Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a
member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which acts
as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities.
    But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC
staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- "No ifs,
ands, or buts."
    Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong
defense of his Iran policy.
    In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan called
charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on
terrorism "utterly false."
    As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union
speech, Reagan said that "serious mistakes were made" but
defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals.
    By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that
was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confident
demeanor.
    He said he took full responsibility for his own actions "and
for those of my administration."
    "As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my
knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As
disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the
one who must answer to the American people for this behavior,"
Reagan said.
    Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had
come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies
around the world -- "and if we're reading the signals right,
even from the Soviets."
    His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet
willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS IRAN POLICY RECORDS IMPROPERLY KEPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said improper
record keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran arms
initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved
arms shipments by Israel before or after the fact.
    In a televised address to the American people Reagan said
he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a
complaint made by the Tower commission.
    The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel.
    "I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when,"
Reagan said.
    Reagan added: "Rest assured, there's plenty of
record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the
White House)."
    The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is
important because it could determine whether the sale violated
various laws, including the Arms Export Control Act.

<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an
ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that
the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran "was a mistake," dealers
said.
    Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of
408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and
New York's close of 410.00/50.
    Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some
initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet
this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities,
they added.
    However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish
impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60
dlrs, dealers said.
    On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of
3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778
close.

<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iranian troops are fighting on two
widely separated fronts in a new offensive in the mountains of
Kurdistan in northern Iraq, Tehran's IRNA news agency said.
    Baghdad war communiques made no mention of fresh fighting
on northern or southern sectors, but a military spokesman
threatened a resumption of air raids on Iranian towns.
    IRNA, monitored by the BBC in London, said Iran had seized
several strategic heights in the northern assault, which
started on Tuesday. It said at least 2,000 Iraqi troops had
been killed, wounded or captured. The offensive is in the Haj
Omran area of Kurdistan, scene of fierce fighting in 1983.
    Tehran radio reported last night that Iranian forces were
in control of four mountain areas, bringing several Iraqi towns
with troop concentrations within artillery range.
    In the south, IRNA said, Iranian forces captured several
Iraqi defence posts east of Iraq's second city, Basra, in a
drive north along the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
    Today is the end of a two-week-long Iraqi moratorium on air
raids declared on condition that Iran stop attacking Iraqi
territory and shelling its towns.
    Iraq's war spokesman said Iran had kept up its attacks and
had made "boasts of illusory victories."

<TITLE>ITALIAN PRESIDENT FACES PROBLEMS CHOOSING LEADER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Francesco Cossiga meets political
leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the
resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.
    Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under
Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister
five times previously and whom the majority Christian
Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again.
    The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing
five-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De
Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party's
president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister.
    Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and
could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading
parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, the
Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being
denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general
elections are likely unless agreement can be reached.
    Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding
talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists
and the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals and
Social Democrats.  After the consultations, Cossiga will name a
prime minister-designate who will try to form a government.

<TITLE>UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Abnormally warm and dry weather over most
parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News
Agency said.
    It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in
eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant
diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing
areas, it said.
    The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and
other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than
seven months.
    The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of
water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,
lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric
power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and
consumers.
    The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels
in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making
harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.
    The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.
More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340
hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with
Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim
its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.
    He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint
production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard
Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been
held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.
    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty
foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,
which would complete production.
    "We expect the successful cooperation between us and
Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other
Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.
    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of
shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese
technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to
competitors in Europe and South Korea.
    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs
since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands
at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly
three mln dlrs.
    But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest
shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun
diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and
other machinery.
    "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"
he said.
    Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln
U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the
previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more
than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.
    CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead
weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships
of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.
    Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least
until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship
repairing was bright.

out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd &lt;JLIT.T>, one of the
world's largest tanker operators, by the end of Japan's
business year on March 31, a spokesman for the Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd &lt;IBJT.T> (IBJ) said.
    Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the
end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and
reserves totalling 63.40 billion.
    In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of
about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153
billion in loans to its subsidiaries.
    Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the
world shipping recession had hit the company hard.
    The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and
three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in
loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy
seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.
    The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line's largest creditor, said
the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and
will be worked out before long.
    Commenting on the article, he said the details of the
package have not yet been settled.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia heads for general elections in
six weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20
years, economists and officials said.
    The government expects no spillover of "people power" from
the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of
President Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the
coming parliamentary elections is assured.
    However, Western diplomats said it is the country's
deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its
stability.
    Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to
Indonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5
billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas
account for 70 pct of export income.
    The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections,
Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay
increases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending.
    The government has also recently increased transport fares
and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the
second year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8
pct.
    The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in
1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio
widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986.
    Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for
almost a third of the 1987/88 budget.
    A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross
domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when
Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered
nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in
1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year.
    In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom
years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct,
the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings.
    Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its
share of new projects being built with overseas money, because
it cannot afford even to meet local costs.
    In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans
totalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37
billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and the
country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors.
    A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December
was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr
loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments.
    Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr
loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which
would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are
on the way, including two more from the World Bank worth a
total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation.
    U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that
economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's
fundamental stability.
    The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has so
far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem
countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting
unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless
it is tackled.
    It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that
unless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach
what it termed "unacceptable levels."
    Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of
last year, but those considered underemployed number around 35
pct.
    What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute
within Suharto's government, with his Western-trained
technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported
by the international financial community.
    But another group supports a protected economy, with more
import substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said.
    The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the
dollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and is
currently working on a series of measures to further encourage
foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector.
    The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's
ability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say.
    So far, despite three packages of economic measures over
the past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that
are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by
business associates, diplomats and bankers say.
    Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on
monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that
Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems.

<TITLE>REAGAN SPEECH WINS MIXED REACTION FROM CONGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Republicans in Congress hailed
President Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid
and constructive while Democrats, who control both houses, said
Reagan would now have to match his words with action.
    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West
Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that
Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes. "But one speech is
not enough to rebuild trust."
    "President Reagan told the American people what they needed
to hear, that mistakes were made and he made them," Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said.
    Reagan, responding to the Tower Commission report
criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal, said for the
first time the Iran arms policy, and not just its
implementation, was a mistake and accepted responsibility for
the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels.
    Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the
administration would "remain under a cloud" until several key
figures in the scandal, including fired National Security
Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John
Poindexter, have told "the whole truth."
    Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday
of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace
Donald Regan as chief of staff, and the replacement of
Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC.
    Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, said he believed Reagan took the right measure in
admitting mistakes without apologising for them.
    Some House Democrats, including Speaker James Wright of
Texas, said earlier they would delay their reaction until
tomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess its
impact.

<TITLE>OPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to
official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is
likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister
of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.
    Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference,
blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and
demand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the third
quarter will be in better balance."
    He said the market is in a period of transition while the
impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix
prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.
    Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude
oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices,
Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that."
    "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think
they'll help each other," he said.
    Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price
Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had
been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.
    "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting
because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices," he said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The easing of rules governing overseas use
of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but
has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,
bond managers and traders said.
    Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in
the Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping
the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the
Japanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the
freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese
accord to internationalise the yen, they said.
    The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese
interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily
with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other
currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85
pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.
    "The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are
only after attractive money," one bond trader said.
    Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous
year, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the
total Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of
Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.
    Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among
Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the
prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort
to "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.
    But the fever continues and the number of offerings could
double again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko
Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.
    The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by
Japanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting
period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is
strong, he added.
    Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more
attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency
investments, traders said.
    "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing
(in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond
department.
    While few foreigners are interested in the secondary
market, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life
insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the
bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer
little currency risk, traders said.
    The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting
period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from
180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that
reflow was fairly small.
    "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the
Euroyen market," he said.
    One trader said that although demand from Japanese
investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said
many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.
Interest rates decline further.
    To encourage further international use of the yen, the
ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen
commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying
demand from potential borrowers.
    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit
non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next
few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic
participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese
banks object to the short-term paper market which they see
encroaching on their business territory.
    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more
demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift
into shorter-term securities if need be.
    "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bond
manager said. If more financial instruments were available,
there might be more trades in yen, he added.
    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though
some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if
they had shorter maturities, traders said.
    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond
maturities within a few months.
    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities
are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules
governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use
of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the
Japanese currency, he said. "If exporters or importers can raise
funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the
Japanese yen as a settlement currency," he added.
    The Finance Ministry official said the government must
constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of
borrowers and investors. "No major market can keep its status
without change," he said.

<TITLE>THAILAND REDUCES MAIN RICE CROP PROJECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's main paddy crop is expected
to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from
a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35
mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.
    It said a joint field survey late last month by the
association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand
indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is
lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.
    The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon
Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were
especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of
1986.
    It said last November that the drought reduced total
national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this
year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.
    The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddy
output.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand clearing house &lt;DataBank
Systems Ltd> said it will know tomorrow what services it will
be able to provide during a strike by bank officers against
trading banks and DataBank set for March 9 and 10.
    Trading banks polled by Reuters said their ability to offer
money market services during the strike depends on whether
Databank remains open, and whether the banks have enough staff
to process transactions.
    A spokesman for the New Zealand Foreign Exchange
Association said dealers would be able to trade during the
strike.
    But the spokesman added that from March 6 to 10 the value
date of currency transactions will be March 16.
    Trading bank spokesmen told Reuters they will try to honour
transactions in which an offshore party sought payment on March
9 or 10, but they could not guarantee settlement.
    The Futures Exchange said trading members and their clients
will be able to continue trading provided they have made
suitable financial arrangements.
    The trading banks affected are the &lt;Bank of New Zealand>,
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S>, Westpac
Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> and &lt;National Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.

<TITLE>BHP TO FLOAT GOLD UNIT WITH ONE-FOR-THREE ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>
(BHP) said it plans a renounceable one-for-three issue of
rights to float a new company, &lt;BHP Gold Mines Ltd> (BHPGM),
which will hold most of BHP's gold interests.
    In a statement BHP said the 25-cent par rights would be
priced at 50 cents for 430 mln of the BHPGM shares on offer.
BHP will subscribe for the remaining 540 mln shares, or 56 pct
of issued capital, on the same terms.
    BHPGM will pay 440 mln dlrs for BHP's gold interests,
excluding its stake in Papua New Guinea's &lt;Ok Tedi Mining Ltd>
and those interests held by BHP's &lt;Utah International Inc>.
    The BHP statement said the issue will be made to
shareholders registered on March 27. It opens April 4 and
closes April 29, and is underwritten by &lt;J.B. Were and Son>.
Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March
23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4.
    BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger
gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It
said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by
the early 1990s. BHPGM's portfolio will include several
Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and
Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development.
    The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP's 45 pct stake
in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory, and
its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie, Queensland.
    BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality
gold stock.
    "The diversity and depth of BHP Gold's portfolio ... Give
the company a sound foundation in current gold production and
an exciting potential for growth," he said.

<TITLE>HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
&lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
share analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
one-for-five bonus issue.
    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>
is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
12 pct.
    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion
House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
pct in 1985.
    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
    The strength of the real-estate market was another major
income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
and other foreign banks," one analyst said.
    The high level of activity on the capital and equities
markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and
Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.
    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much
lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."
    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have
improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, Texas, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The directors of Hughes Tool Co
&lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject
a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.
    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
but decided against it.
    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

projected money market surplus, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a
39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420
billion yen, mainly due to payment of national annuities, money
traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill
supply at about 1,300 yen.

<TITLE>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before Plaza," he said.
    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

<TITLE>HAWKE SEES FOUR BILLION DLR BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
Treasurer Paul Keating said the government's 1986/87 Budget
deficit could hit four billion dlrs against the official
forecast of 3.5 billion.
    Hawke told a Sydney radio station the deficit "may turn out
at four billion." He and Keating last week warned that the
budget deficit was running above target and vowed sharp
decisions on spending in a May 14 economic statement.
    A four billion dollar Budget deficit would be in line with
private economists' forecasts and compares with a 1985/86
shortfall of 5.73 billion dlrs.
    Hawke said the 1986/87 deficit would be equal to 1.5 pct of
forecast Gross Domestic Product against five pct when he took
office during the 1982/83 year.
    "In money terms (the deficit has been reduced) from the 9.6
billion dlrs that we inherited ... Down to about 3.6 billion,
it may turn out at four billion dlrs," Hawke said.
    In a separate interview Keating said: "The deficit for this
year, projected, was 3.5 billion .... It is in fact running ...
Over four billion and we will be trying to bring that in close
to target."

<TITLE>SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain said it raised the
reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
money supply and inflation targets.
    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
said the measure would take effect from March 13.
    "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the
statement said.
    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
rate unchanged.
    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
    Banking sources said that although the January money supply
figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
prices were under control.
    Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from
six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during
1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

<TITLE>JAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese creditor banks are close to a
decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they
will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable
debts owed by developing nations, international financial
sources told Reuters.
    Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the
firm set up before the end of the month, they said.
    The scheme is intended to improve financial management at
the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts
turning bad, the sources said.
    Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would
indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68
billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese
creditors to finalise the project, the sources said.
    Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid
a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.
    There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and
perhaps as many as 28, they said.
    About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans
totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about
15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.
    The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the
Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said.
    The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with
participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.
    The firm will then use the funds to buy from its
stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign
loans which are potentially bad, the sources said.
    The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.
    Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to
debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said.
    The financial sources said interest payments to the firm
would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have
asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss
reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.
    A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it
may encourage new lending to developing countries.
    The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up
to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled
countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting
for one pct of the loans.

<TITLE>IRAN REPORTS HEAVY FIGHTING IN IRAQI KURDISTAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran said its troops repulsed heavy Iraqi
counter-attacks and continued their advance through the rugged
mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan in overnight fighting on the
northern war front.
    Iran launched the new offensive, codenamed Karbala-7, on
Tuesday night among the snow-capped peaks of the Haj Omran
border area of northeast Iraq.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the
troops "continued their successful advance ... With more thrusts
into enemy positions."
    It said "remnants of Iraqi Brigade 604 was shattered and 200
of its personnel killed or wounded." One battalion of the 25th
Division's Third Brigade thrown into counter-attacks today
suffered 70 pct losses, the agency added. Some 208 prisoners of
war had been taken from the front.
    IRNA said the Iranian forces backed by heavy artillery fire
were continuing to advance. No Iranian casualties were given.
    The area between Haj Omran and the Kurdish town of Rawandiz
some 65 km inside Iraq was the scene of heavy fighting in 1983.
Iran has backed dissident Kurds in the area in attacks on
government positions and installations in northern Iraq.
    IRNA said the Iranian forces captured large amounts of
munitions in the latest fighting.
    The Iraqis have made no comment so far on the Kurdistan
fighting, or on advances Tehran reported yesterday on the
southern war front east of the strategic Iraqi port of Basra.
    IRNA said today a group of its reporters visited
newly-captured areas on the southern front and found the
battlefield littered with the bodies of Iraqi soldiers and
burnt military equipment.
    They quoted an Iranian soldier, Hamid Dehqani, as saying
heavy rainfall during the past few days "had paralysed the Iraqi
enemy from embarking on any action" against the attacking
Iranians.
    IRNA referred to the "Fish Canal" -- the man-made Fish Lake
-- made by the Iraqis as a defensive barrier on the eastern
side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
    The agency yesterday said infantry and armour of the
Revolutionary Guards had captured strong defences west of the
canal in bitter fighting with Iraqi troops.

<TITLE>TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
earlier, the central bank said.
    Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
March 4.
    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
billion, according to official statistics.
    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
of this year.
    The reserves could support imports of more than two years
for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the
U.S.

<TITLE>BELGIAN ECU COIN ISSUE PRICED, SALE DATE SET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu
coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March
23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry
spokesman said.
    Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold
from the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for
these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely
to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.
    At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of
thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will
be sold both in Belgium and abroad.
    The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,
the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's
currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.
    The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the
EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark
Eyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of
economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a
political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the
Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.
    The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand
is expected to come from coin collectors.

<TITLE>BANK OF CEYLON TO ADOPT NEW POLICIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sri Lanka's largest bank, the
government-owned Bank of Ceylon, plans to adopt a more
aggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excess
liquidity, estimated at some 500 mln rupees, and enlarge the
country's export manufacturing base, the bank's new chairman
Nimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview.
    The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is
holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to
be announced later, he said.
    Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of
Ceylon, the nation's central bank, until January.
    A Swiss-based non-governmental group, which Sandaratne
declined to identify, has agreed in principal to guarantee
export credits, he said, but refused to elaborate further.
    The bank may also consider more actively participating in
the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial
non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees,
or about 70 pct of the total market, he said.
    Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd.
    The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operating
here have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake in
MBSL, Sandaratne said.
    He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profits
for calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln the
previous year. The increase was eroded by increased provisions
for bad debts, he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mln
allotted for general provisions, he added.

<DATELINE>    PORT MORESBY, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Papua New Guinea Government
will establish a public corporation to invest in resources
projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.
    "We intend to provide a means through which less privileged
individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the
development of mining and petroleum projects," he told
Parliament.
    Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in
major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects
would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take
over the state's equity in current developments.
    Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with
exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on
about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.
    "The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New
Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases
in an orderly way," he said.
    Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be
established or exactly what form it would take, but said the
government would study whether it should be directly involved
in exploration or development.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against
the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at
today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.
The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last
week.
    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,
with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.
    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for
transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last
week.
    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the
central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as
punishment for inadequate documentation in previous
transactions.
    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are
based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has
complained in the past that many are failing to produce the
right paperwork within the specified time.

<TITLE>U.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic
Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to
reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.
    "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we
have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he
told a press conference after three days of talks.
    "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need
visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more
imports and we need greater domestic-led growth."
    Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,
Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce
its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.
    He named several areas of particular concern to Washington
-- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport,
agricultural products and car telephones.
    He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in
semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese
producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other
than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese
market has not increased, he said.

<TITLE>JAPANESE CAPITAL INVESTMENT SEEN SLUGGISH IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese private plant and equipment
investment will grow 0.1 pct in fiscal 1987, starting April 1,
from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing
sector spending, the Japan Development Bank said.
    Capital spending by manufacturing industries, hit hard by
the rise of the yen, will fall 5.6 pct, a survey said.
    Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow
four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have
benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust, it said.
    The 0.1 pct overall increase compares to the 3.1 pct rise
the bank projected for the current fiscal year.
    In the manufacturing sector, iron and steel companies are
the most pessimistic, with an estimated 18.0 pct spending cut.
    Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will
decline by 18 pct and 11.2 pct respectively, the survey said.
    In the non-manufacturing sector, transport and leasing
service industries are expected to increase their spending by
15.7 pct and 10.6 pct, respectively.
    The bank's survey, conducted in early February, was based
on questionnaires from 1,738 corporations in all sectors having
a business relationship with the bank.

<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY FIXES DATE OF BUDGET HEARING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for
1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the
opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable.
    In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament
decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to
hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14,
parliamentary officials said.
    The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last
Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a
controversial government-proposed sales tax plan.
    Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been
delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax
on which the budget plan is based.
    A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again
boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to push
through the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closely
negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I would
like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly."
    The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, is
planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual
income and corporate tax.
    The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing
because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the
budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower
House plenary session, political analysts said.
    The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an
unforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the
sales tax.

<TITLE>GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KIEL, West Germany, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for the West
German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected."
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

<TITLE>CREDITOR BANKS MAY BUY INTO SINGAPORE COFFEE FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The nine creditor banks of the
Singapore coffee trader &lt;Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd> are
thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company
themselves, a creditor bank official said.
    Since last December the banks have been allowing the
company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an
overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm.
    At least one company has expressed interest and
negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.
    However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the
stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven
mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking
sources said.
    Teck Hock's financial adviser, Singapore International
Merchant Bankers Ltd (SIMBL), will work on the new proposal
with the creditor banks, they said.
    Major holdings are likely to be held by the two largest
creditor banks, Standard Chartered Bank &lt;STCH.L> and
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd &lt;OCBM.SI>, they added.
    Teck Hock owes over 100 mln Singapore dlrs and the creditor
banks earlier this week agreed to let Teck Hock fufill
profitable contracts to help balance earlier losses.
    The nine banks are Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, United
Overseas Bank Ltd &lt;UOBM.SI>, &lt;Banque Paribas>, &lt;Bangkok Bank
Ltd,> &lt;Citibank NA>, Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, Algemene Bank

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms," one banking source said.
    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.
    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation."
    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland is
accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of Western economy."
    "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that
Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
in play now," said one Western envoy.
    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
Poland's efforts to regain entry.
    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs."
    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
Solidarity."
    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
looking for a lead from the United States.
    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners."
    He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
interested in the settlement of Polish debt."
    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    "As a major superpower the United States can influence
international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

<TITLE>U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain had a visible trade deficit of
2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
statistics show.
    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in
deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and
a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter
figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.
    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO
said.
    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
increased by 2.1 billion.
    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,
particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France is likely to cut its
money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
of turbulence.
    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
where it has now stabilised.
    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
using the intervention rate to set the floor.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
scope for a small fall in rates.
    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

<TITLE>HONG KONG CD MARKET SHUTS DOWN AFTER NEW ISSUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market
was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr
certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank
of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced,
bankers said.
    Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road
to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early
February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue.
    Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all
major players stopped making markets in existing issues.
    The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to
swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due
to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs
flooded the market in January.
    Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants
pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense
speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against
the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed.
    The speculation depressed local interest rates and
unleashed a flood of new issues.
    But the speculation faded in early February and interest
rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining
the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate
capital market.
    By late February the market had recovered considerably but
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York
launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since
then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until
China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the
Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with
quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today.
    Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but
began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new
issue circulated.
    When the deal was launched the major players quickly
suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own
issues, brokers said. "We just don't know where the market is
going," said a European banker.
    They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low
of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10
basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister
banks in the Bank of China group.
    An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was
launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the
market at that time.
    But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the
present market conditionS, "the timing was just not right."
    "If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues
now, and then the market would be all right," another dealer
said.
    "But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic," he said.
"The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as
what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals."
    Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to
recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the
group has not yet been finalised.
    "Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the
deal," said a dealer. "But there are other considerations such as
relationship." He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.
    A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers
decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new
issue.
    "Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese
entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue," he
said.
    Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead
managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 500
billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a
projected money market surplus, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a
39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420
billion yen, mainly due to payment of national annuities, money
traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill
supply at about 1,300 yen.

it needs an extension of deadlines for payment of capital and
interest on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt, Industry and
Foreign Trade Secretary Roberto Lavagna told reporters.
    "We, the developing countries, are going to insist on the
application of contingency clauses, to extend deadlines for the
payment of capital as well as interest," he said.
    He said this could bring about what he called a possible
automatic capitalisation of those parts of debt interest that
could not be paid and even the elimination of a portion of the
debt.

    The Bank has thus given a total of 37 mln stg so far today,
which leaves the bulk of a 1.15 billion stg shortage still in
the system. Dealers noted that money market rates again eased
this morning and the Bank may have refused bill offers from the
discount houses at rates below its established dealing levels.

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT> SEEKS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hughes Tool Co said its board has
appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer
in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker
International Corp &lt;BKO>.
    Last night, Hughes directors said it would terminate its
agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed
if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice
Department that the Hughes board had determined to be
unreasonable.
    The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at
Hughes.  Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer.
    Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the
Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on
condition that they find a buyer approved by the  Department
for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's
Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic
electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date
the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their
agreement.
    Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it
not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes
technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions.
    Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand,
Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it
would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree."
    The company said its board found the consent decree to be
unreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed a
substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would
be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of
the combined company, which would have been called Baker Hughes
Inc, and would include all of Reed's international assets and
its coring and diamond bit assets.
    Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent
decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of
Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to
sell Reed.
    The company said the board decision to adopt its own
divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker
did not accept was unanimous.

<DATELINE>    SANTIAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A tremor hit northern Chile early today
but there were no immediate reports of victims or of damage to
the country's vital mining industry, the National Bureau for
Emergencies, ONEMI, said.
    The effects of the tremor at 0620 hrs (0920 GMT) registered
four to six degrees on the 12-degree Mercalli scale in
Antofagasta, 1,000 km north of Santiago, and five to six
degrees in Chuquicamata and Calama, at the centre of Chile's
mining region.
    The tremor was followed by a milder aftershock at 0758 hrs.
    An ONEMI spokesman said windows had been broken and a
number of cornices had fallen off buildings in the worst-hit
areas. These effects are described as up to seven degrees on
the Mercalli scale. The tremor caused a partial power cut in
northern Chile, the spokesman added.
    Quoting from the latest report from the area, received at
8.37 A.M., He said the effects of the tremor registered two to
three degrees on the Mercalli scale in Arica, on the northern
border with Peru, and three to four in Copiapo, 700 km north of
Santiago.
    ONEMI could not provide a reading on the Richter scale.

<TITLE>TANZANIAN RAILWAYS SECURE 25.6 MLN DLRS AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and
European countries for a one-year emergency repair program,
Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said.
    Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank
sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would
enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800
wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.
    The World Bank, African Development Bank, European
Community, Canada, Belgium, West Germany, Britain, Sweden,
Italy and Denmark had contributed to the package, he said.
    TRC runs a rail network linking Dar es Salaam and the
northern port of Tanga with the coffee-growing area around
Mount Kilimanjaro and ports on Lake Victoria and Lake
Tanganyika.
    It is under separate administration from the
Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian
copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa, which has
already received substantial aid as part of international
efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on
trade routes through South Africa.
    But this is the first international aid package for TRC,
which also carries cargo for Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.

<TITLE>EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Hill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC crude oil output in the first few
days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.
    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, in
mln bpd -

<TITLE>BETHLEHEM &lt;BS> HAS INVESTIGATED CHAPTER 11</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BETHLEHEM, Pa., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bethlehem Steel Corp has
investigated the ramifications of a filing for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws but has no
present plans to file, a company spokesman told Reuters.
    The spokesman said the investigation was made some time ago
and was undertaken as a precaution in the interest of prudent
management.
    He said while Bethlehem, which has been losing money for
several years, does not intend to seek protection from
creditors now, it could do so if conditions worsened,
particularly if it ran out of cash.
    But the spokesman said Bethlehem ended 1986 with over 460
mln dlrs in cash on hand, partly due to the sale of assets over
the year, and expects to maintain its cash position at around
that level through 1987.
    At the end of 1985, Bethlehem had less than 100 mln dlrs in
cash.

<TITLE>BAKER &lt;BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES &lt;HT> MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Baker International corp said it has
filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co
to complete its proposed merger with Baker.
    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
Department consent decree.
    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more
burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary
damages it did not name.
    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
interests of shareholders of both companies.

<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank
deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and
bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a
ministry spokesman said.
    The measure was published today in the Official State
Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on
rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.
    The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct
from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must
lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public
interest."
    Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in
a 20 pct drop in profits this year.
    Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa
told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset
investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.

<TITLE>USAIR &lt;U> REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA> TAKEOVER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said its board has
rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."
    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
&lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
USAir common during a period just before the merger.
    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests."
    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont.
    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair
price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

<TITLE>U.S. EXPANSION THREATENED - CONGRESSIONAL REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. economy is facing several
serious problems which threaten its continued expansion,
according to a Congressional report released today.
    The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional
Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish
growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near
future.
    Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic
report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation.
    Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee,
which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.
    "The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion
dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger
signals that lie just below the surface," Committee chairman
Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.
    "A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current
recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin
ice," the Maryland Democrat said.
    He said the danger signals included a decline in
investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining
the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled
by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the
nation's farmers.
    Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood
of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around
three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration
forecasts.
    "The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're
comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful
that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that
employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident
in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,"
the Republican report said.
    "The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress
is reducing the federal deficit," the Republicans added.
    Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but
also wanted the government to spend more on education, job
training, research and development and health care.
    They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult
for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the
economy if this becomes necessary.
    "There is now substantial concern about the inflationary
effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary
pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money
supply," the Democrat report said.
    "At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources
of capital in American investment markets means that the
Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past
in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down."
    "Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy
is thus not very encouraging," the Democrats said.
    The Democrats called on the Administration to be more
aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking
new initiatives to solve the international debt problem.
    The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been
caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially
the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982.
    Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to
increase American productivity including incentives for saving
and investment in plant and equipment and development of a
better educated work force.

830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
finance director John Edwards said.
    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
restrict the car's price.
    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
of net sales and training two pct.
    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
but Egan said this would take at least another three years
    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last
quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after
reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
expectations, dealers said.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's state-owned Cie Generale
d'Electricite (CGE) is likely to be privatised during May this
year, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Although the Finance Ministry simply said that the group
would be privatised during the course of this year, when it
first announced the operation in early January, the May date is
earlier than the market had expected.
    As a result it will follow close on the heels of the
privatisation of the TF1 television channel and the advertising
group &lt;Agence Havas>.
    Last month the government privatised the first of the state
financial groups, Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.P>, in a
floatation which was 40 times oversubscribed.
    And in December the first of the industrial groups, glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.P>, returned to the private
sector.
    CGE has interests ranging from telecommunications to
shipbuilding and nuclear engineering, and recently struck a
deal with ITT Corp &lt;ITT.N> to create the world's second largest
telecommunications group under the Alcatel name.

<TITLE>FIVE GROUPS APPLY TO BUY FRENCH TELEPHONE GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Five consortia have applied to buy the
French state-owned telephone equipment manufacturer &lt;Cie
Generale de Constructions Telephoniques (CGCT)>, which will
give the owners control of 16 pct of the French telephone
switching market, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur said.
    The French government has given itself until the end of
April to decide which applicant will be accepted, they added.
    While several foreign groups have said they want to gain a
foothold in the French market, their potential stake in CGCT is
limited to 20 pct under privatisation laws passed last year,
with 80 pct to be left in French hands.
    The Finance Ministry sources gave no details of the groups
interested in CGCT, but several have publicly announced their
candidacies.
    U.S. Telecommunications giant American Telephone and
Telegraph Co &lt;T.N> which has been at the centre of the two-year
battle for CGCT, has teamed up with the Dutch-based &lt;Philips
Telecommunications Industrie B.V.>, a subsidiary of NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabriek &lt;PGLO.AS> and &lt;Societe Anonyme de
Telecommunications> (SAT) to present a joint bid, in
association with holding company Cie du Midi SA &lt;MCDP.P> and
five French investment funds.
    A second bid has come from the West German electronics
group Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F>, which hopes to take a 20 pct stake
in CGCT, with the French telecommunications &lt;Jeumont-Schneider>
taking the remaining 80 pct.
    Sweden's &lt;AB LM Ericsson> has also submitted a bid for the
maximum 20 pct permitted, in association with French defence
electronics group &lt;Matra>, which would hold between 40 and 49
pct, and construction group &lt;Bouygues>.
    Matra has already acquired CGCT's private telephone
business.

<TITLE>SPEAKER SEEKING SUPPORT FOR U.S. TAX INCREASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbying
congressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficit
about 40 billion dlrs, half through spending cuts and the
remainder through tax hikes, congressional sources said.
    He is backing a half and half plan and has made the
suggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committee
privately, committee sources said.
    However, a committee source told Reuters that committee
Democrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficit
about 40 billion dlrs, half through taxes and the Speaker's
move was seen as building support outside the committee.
    Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has no
specifics, although he has floated a stock transfer tax and
also has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy.
    Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress, and
some congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax.
    The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed at
reducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimated
by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
    Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed a
budget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will not
reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billion
dlrs, although he claims it will be in the spirit of it.

<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and
European countries for a one-year emergency repair program,
Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said.
    Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank
sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would
enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800
wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.
    The World Bank, African Development Bank, European
Community, Canada, Belgium, West Germany, Britain, Sweden,
Italy and Denmark had contributed to the package, he said.
    TRC runs a rail network linking Dar es Salaam and the
northern port of Tanga with the coffee-growing area around
Mount Kilimanjaro and ports on Lake Victoria and Lake
Tanganyika.
    It is under separate administration from the
Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian
copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa, which has
already received substantial aid as part of international
efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on
trade routes through South Africa.
    But this is the first international aid package for TRC,
which also carries cargo for Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.

<TITLE>YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK , March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Responsibility for the appreciation of
the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with
those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter
    Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in
those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of
their currencies against the dollar.
    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.
could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against
the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
with Taiwain and Korea.
    "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports
in the short term, but in the long run they have to be
concerned about how they are perceived in the international
business community," Yeutter said.
    For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade
surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
country.
    He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move
to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in two
or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that
prevails in Taiwan."
    Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50
billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not
sustainable.
    "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat
of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeutter
said.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS STRONGLY CRITICISE EC MILK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC agriculture ministers' agreement on
reducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossible
situation, French farm unions said.
    The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part of
planned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cut
milk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm
union, the FNSEA, said.
    The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural
Policy, French milk producers said in a press release.
    But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said
repercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.
    "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at the
level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets
for butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit to
Rouen.
    FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the
milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement
and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals,
rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.
    The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission
proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.
Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling pork
prices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts in
milk output.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said its forces killed or wounded
15,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards as they crushed a new
Iranian offensive near the strategic port city of Basra.
    A high command war communique said four Revolutionary
Guards divisions attacked Iraqi positions east of Basra on the
Gulf War southern front, but they were fully crushed by noon
(0900 GMT).
    Adbul-Jabbar Mohsen, chief of the defence ministry
political department, said the Iranians had 15,000 casualties.
    Iran earlier today said its forces launched fresh attacks
near Basra last night, adding that 1,200 Iraqis were killed or
wounded in fighting near Fish Lake, 10 km east of Basra.
    In its first reaction to Tehran reports of a new Iranian
offensive on the northern front, Iraq said fighting continues
around the strategic mountain peak of Kardamanend, overlooking
the Haj Omran-Rawandiz axis close to the Iranian border.
    A military spokesman said Iran launched its attack in the
north "to (turn) Iraqi attention towards that area and relax
pressure in the south."
    He added, "Iraq knows well that Iran's main goal is to
occupy Basra in the south and that was the reason why Iraq has
repelled their new offensive so decisively and firmly."
    Iran reported heavy fighting on both fronts today.

<TITLE>ENZON &lt;ENZN> SAYS DRUG TREATS DISEASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Enzon Inc said a new
treatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA has
restored the functioning of the immune system in the first two
children that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine
deaminase.
    The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency
disease, or "bubble boy disease"
    Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease that
hampers the development of the immune system. It has killed
most of its victims before adulthood.
    Children with the disease are consigned to live in a
sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid
infection, the company said.
    The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,
showed that two children suffering from the disease were
treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of
serious infection during that time, the company said. The
results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine
Deaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the
immune system.
    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme
with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to
disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,
preventing rejection.
    "Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function
occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of
T-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before
treatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.
    "The children are now more active and have begun to gain
weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very
poor in comparison to normal children of the same age," the

    The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of
the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow
transplants, but for most, donors are not available or
transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other
diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by
introducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.

<TITLE>OCCIDENTAL &lt;OXY> OFFERS OVER 37 MLN SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Occidental Petroleum Corp said its
common stock offering has been further increased to a total of
37,950,000 shares.
    The company explained that underwriters exercised in full
their option to increase tohe offering by buying an additional
4,950,000 shares over and above the 33 mln brought to market
yesterday. Originally, Occidental had planned to offer 30 mln
shares. It had 165 mln outstanding prior to the offering.
    The underwriters are Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Kidder
Peabody and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc.
    At the public offering price of 30.50 dlrs a share,
Occidental said, the total value of the offering was nearly
1.16 billion dlrs, making it the largest underwritten common
equity offering by a U.S. natural resource company.
    The company said the significant financial improvements
from applying the net proceeds of the offering, principally to
the reduction of debt, along with its 1986 restructuring of oil
and gas operations and the acquisition of Midcon Corp have
positioned Occidental to benefit from an improving oil and gas
industry environment.

<TITLE>CONGRESS MAY CURB U.S. AID TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured U.S. farmers and miners.
    With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last
year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing
to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other
development banks if the money is used to subsidize production
or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
     "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Senator Don Nickles, an
Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators
seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires that the United States vote against
such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately
approved by the banks.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture.
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,
the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a
provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared
Congress.
    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would
have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the
commodities could be handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.
    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho
and Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it
faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has
blocked its consideration by the House in the past.
    Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any
related legislation this year, an aide said.

<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F>, the
diversified engineering and pipe-making group, is interested in
taking a stake in a U.S. Company or companies but has not yet
found a suitable firm, a spokesman said in reply to questions.
    Mannesmann managing board chairman Werner Dieter told the
business weekly Wirtschaftswoche in an interview that
Mannesmann wanted to invest in a U.S. Company in order to
strengthen its presence on the U.S. Market.
    Dieter said Mannesmann would act quickly when and if it
found a firm in which it wanted to take a stake.
    The Mannesmann spokesman declined to say in which
industrial sector the group may make a U.S. Acquisition or how
big the acquisition might be.
    He also said the group had not yet completed taking over a
stake in car components firm &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
    Mannesmann had said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct
stake in Fichtel und Sachs's holding company, Sachs AG, in the
first quarter. The spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of
intent on the takeover from the heirs of the company's late
owner but completion has been delayed by legal questions
concerning the inheritance.

    The company said Executive Life Insurance Co gave the

the company.
    Executive Life of New York took credits for reinsurance

<TITLE>ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings
for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market
conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to
different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.
    The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,
while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.
    The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with
lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
volume.
    Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at
the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading
Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg
from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a
general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
stg from 205 mln in 1985.
    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd noted.
    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in
performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the
improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.
    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through
faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which
typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year
lag, analysts said.
    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third
quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.
    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in
U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes
added.
    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
U.S. Exploration activity. "Exploration is currently pretty
flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no
massive upturn," he said.
    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North
Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.
    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. "If
you are not exploring you are not going to find anything," he
noted.
    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
below 20 dlrs a barrel.
    This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the
lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC
marginal production shutting down. "OPEC has done pretty
extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,"
he added.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
choke off money supply growth.
    "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said.
"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."
    "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.
    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
raising interest rates.
    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
exports less competitive.
    The government says industry's competitiveness is also
being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
European Community, which it joined a year ago.
    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
sacrifices.
    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
demands essentially involve more government spending, have
become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
money market too hard.
    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
inevitably, push lending rates higher.
    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
interest rates.

<TITLE>EC DAIRY OUTPUT ACCORD PAVES WAY FOR MORE REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials and diplomats said EC farm
ministers, who earlier this week ended another marathon
negotiating session, achieved more than ever before in the
fight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are now
preparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas.
    Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil
"lakes" and level the "grain mountain" that have brought the
Community so much unwelcome publicity.
    Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hours
of negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cut
milk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,
now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.
    Officials said new rules, which place strict limits on
farmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, could
be expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle and
pave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.
    The deal was reached despite determined attempts at
backsliding by some states as the implications of the original
outline accord reached last December began to sink in.
    "Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministers
never wavered from the main features of the deal," one senior
official said, adding the result augured well for talks later
this month on other reforms.
    The Commission is leading the fight against food surpluses
and has now proposed the most severe annual price review, at
which ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.
    Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standards
enforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to intervention
curtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effective
price cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.
    EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen is currently working on
proposals to provide direct income aids to farmers to cushion
them from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy and
encourage ministers to swallow the reform pill.

<TITLE>MCI &lt;MCIC> SEEKS IMMEDIATE ATT &lt;T> DEREGULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>MCI Communications Corp. called for
immediate federal deregulation of American Telephone and
Telegraph Co., its principal competitor.
    MCI said it will ask the Federal Communications Commission
tomarrow to deregulate ATT in order to let marketplace forces
govern the long distance telephone market.
    "It's time to let the market manage ATT," MCI president Bert
Roberts told a news briefing here.
    MCI has seen its profits shaved recently by ATT long
distance rate reductions ordered by the FCC following the
breakup of the Bell System.
    The MCI move signals its belief that ATT may raise profits
rather than cut rates if deregulated.
    To allay consumers' fears that deregulation might lead to
price increases, Roberts said one alternative open to the FCC
would be adoption of a transitional "price cap" concept.
    Roberts noted that such a plan is backed by FCC
commissioner Dennis Patrick, whose is widely expected to be
named FCC chairman.
    Roberts conceded that ATT's deregulation posed risks to
MCI.
    "The greater risk, however, is continuing the artificial
market environment created by piecemeal FCC deregulation of
ATT."

General Mining Union Corp Ltd's Kinross Mines Ltd will face
charges of culpable homicide following last year's disaster
when 177 gold miners died, the Attorney General's Office said.
    The mineworkers were killed last September at Kinross when
a fire set off toxic fumes which suffocated miners underground.
    Three of the accused face alternative charges of breaking

    The spokesman said the case would probably be heard in
Witbank Regional Court, near Kinross, in mid-May.

<TITLE>WESTERN CANADA HURT BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Western Canada's resource-based economy
is being hurt by international market forces and there is
little Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson
said.
    "If you can tell me how we can get the international energy
price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we
can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen," Wilson
told the House of Comnons Finance Committee.
    Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat
farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson
said it has to be recognized the area was a "prisoner of market
forces outside the boundaries of this country."
    Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the
government's spending estimates released earlier this week,
said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing
more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.
    "Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on
our part in dealing with a very difficult problem," Wilson said
in response to questions about management of the economy from
opposition party members.
    He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the
country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States,
which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada.

    According to the text of a speech made in the town of

benefit from more stable prices. He said he had rejected the
agreement because he preferred there to be no change in the
EC's system of intervention. However, an objective analysis of
the accord showed it contained positive elements, he said.
    No formal vote was taken on the EC accord, but a spokesman
for the Agriculture Ministry in Bonn said Kiechle had made it
clear in discussions in Brussels that he did not accept it.
Ireland and Luxembourg were also opposed.

<TITLE>CONGRESS EYES LOANS THAT AID U.S. COMPETITORS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured American farmers and miners.
    With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year
and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing to
hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development
banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to
produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
    "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma
Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support
for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires the United States to vote against such
loans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine
loan was "really the only one you can point to and criticize."
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions
were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing
U.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.
    This year's proposal, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals.
    Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the
production, marketing and export of the commodities could be
handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker
at the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, "Many say the
banks are financing competition for American jobs."
    She recommended that the United States use its
participation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans
as a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morton-Thiokol Corp will be included in
Standard and Poor's 500 Stock index, effective today, Standard
and Poor's Corp said.
    Trading in Morton-Thiokol stock opened up 4-1/4 at 50 on
turnover of 122,700 shares after
a delayed opening due to an imbalance of orders.
    There are certain funds which base their portfolio on the
500 stocks listed on the index, and the imbalance of orders
reflects those managers adding shares of Morton-Thiokol,
Standard and Poor's said.
    Adding Morton-Thiokol's stock to the 500 index list is a
"minor positive development," analyst Martin Ziegler said,
noting that it brings in new buyers for the shares and gives
the company a higher profile.
    James Arenson at DLJ Securities agreed that
inclusion on the index automatically creates new buyers and
noted it also allows those portfolio managers who could not buy
the stock to purchase shares.
    While Morton-Thiokol's stock opened up much higher, it gave
back some of its gains and is currently trading at 47-3/8, up
1-5/8, a pattern termed, by one analyst, as "typical" when a
company is newly added.

<TITLE>SOYBEAN GROUP HEAD URGES USDA ACTION ON LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Department must make
a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan
or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the
government and foreign soybean production will increase, the
president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.
    "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another
... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as
much as they want, but they have to eventually address this
problem," David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.
    USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the
soybean loan, Haggard said.
    "I don't know if USDA is really very serious about
addressing the soybean loan problem," he said.
    At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA
leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan
-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.
    The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,
R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a
5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.
    Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed
proposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to see
the farm bill be torn apart."
    He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to
a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could
change the loan without new legislation.
    Making the loan partially in certificates which would not
have to be paid back would be one option, he said.

Lyng does not intend to discuss a wheat export enhancement
initiative to the Soviet Union at a cabinet-level Economic
Policy Council meeting set for tomorrow, an aide to Lyng said.
    "He (Lyng) does not intend to bring it up," the aide said,
adding that the subsidy offer remains "dormant."
    Lyng plans to spend "about five minutes" reviewing the status
of farm legislation on Capitol Hill before the Economic Policy
Council, which is responsible for guiding the administration's
economic policy, the aide said.
    The USDA secretary met this morning with members of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, but the handful of lawmakers

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Export Import Bank president John
Bohn said the agency was adopting a new policy of increased
risk coverage and as part of it will adopt a system of
risk-related fees.
    In an address before the Ex-Im's annual bankers conference
Bohn outlined a series of measures designed to bridge the gap
between reduced export lending by commercial banks and
activities by U.S. trading partners.
    Bohn said the bank will be more selective in requiring
soverign guarantees and will consider well-conceived projects
"even if they do not earn foreign exchange."
    He said the Exim will operate four broad programs after May
1. They are short-term insurance, a direct loan program that
will be available for both medium and long-term transactions, a
guarantee program and intermediary funding program.
    For medium-term guarantees, Bohn said Exim will increase
exporter coverage for commercial risks from the 85 pct
currently to 98 pct.

<DATELINE>    EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS> said it had agreed with
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T> and Nippon Gakki
Co Ltd &lt;NGAK.T> of Japan to jointly produce the components of
the newly developed laser audio-video player.
    Philips last month announced it and Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> had
developed a world standard for the new combi-player.
    The player will be able to take the three sizes of new
compact disk videos (CDV), which give near perfect sound and
image production, as well as the traditional audio laser discs.
    Yamaha will develop the laser technology, Matsushita the
video specifications and Philips will work on rendering the
player compatible with existing European 50-hertz television
standards, Philips spokeswoman Marijke van Hooren said.
    Each company will assemble and market the product under its
own label, and it is hoped other hardware companies will join
in the marketing of the new product, she said.
    She said there were around 160 companies which hold
licences for the manufacture of CD players.

a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that
focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders

    "We have been recommending the stock since it was in the
50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong
earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and
anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch
analyst Charles Ryan said. He said a negative opinion by
another brokerage house hurt the stock Wednesday, and it can be
bought at a relatively bargain price today.
    Ryan said "you always have to look at Polaroid at its
weakness. Its a volatile stock that has to be caught on
weakness." Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point
early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down
over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8.
    "Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and
film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40
pct," Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the
first quarter compared to 52 cts a share earned a year earlier.
He expects the company to earn four dlrs a share in 1987 as
compared to 3.34 dlrs a share last year.

<TITLE>FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>French official reserves fell 45.06
billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement.
    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
during the month, the ministry said.
    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
result of using very short-term financing instruments.
    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
franc.
    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74
billion at end December.
    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion
francs from 75.27 billion at end December.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln
francs to 19.31 billion francs.

<TITLE>BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ****RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil has no set target for
its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of
International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas,
President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster
said.
    He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its
export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it
had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as
the country's export target to ICO-member countries.
    The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an
agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.
    It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of
an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be
above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.
    Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and
market analysts before taking any decision on export policy,
but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market
conditions.
    "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause
markets to panic," Dauster added.
    He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee
to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.
    "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does
not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.
    Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said
consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two
mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.
    "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss
for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to
recover," he said.
    The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving
average of exportable production surpluses would lead to
overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher
quotas, he said.
    Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility
had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its
stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.
    Close links would continue with these producers,
particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African
countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was
envisaged at present.
    He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a
system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has
been abandoned."
    Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for
May shipment coffee will be opened.
    He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy
of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as
some exporters had suggested.
    He noted export registrations for the first four months of
the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9
mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between
11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.
    He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln
bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate
until late April.

<TITLE>BRITAIN SEEMS SET FOR NEW CASH ROW WITH EC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Youssef Azmeh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain appeared set for a new cash row
with its European Community partners as evidence emerged that
it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to
radically alter the way the EC is financed.
    Analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released
yesterday by the EC's executive Commission showed their full
impact, were they in force this year, would have left Britain
worse off by 545 mln European Currency Units.
    The proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member
government after a debate expected to open next month.
    The Commission said they were necessary to prevent the EC
from sliding once again into bankruptcy, and has described the
current financing system as unfair and unacceptable.
    British dissatisfaction with the cost of EC membership has
long been a source of friction, and diplomats said the
proposals could well reopen the wound.
    This was despite a proposed correction of Britain's budget
contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of
the EC's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small
size of its agricultural sector.
    Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements in
the system which could also substantially increase their own EC
payments, the main opposition was expected from Britain.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has made clear in recent
statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present
system, under which Britain is refunded two-thirds of its net
payments to the EC, unless a fairer system is devised.
    The diplomats said Thatcher was unlikely to consider the
proposed system as fair.
    The Commission's proposals would base a state's
contribution on its gross national product, which the
commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative
wealth.
    The main element of the previous system was a share of
value added tax collected in member states.
    The mechanism to compensate Britain for its inability to
take up a higher proportion of EC farm expenditure will have to
be paid for by the other 11 states.
    The Commission has also proposed to end repayments to all
states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs
duties on behalf of the EC.

<TITLE>SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping
insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
conditions on Wall Street.
    "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
have become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
start of a hearing on SEC activities.
    "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"
Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
is particularly distressing."
    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
    "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
through to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in his
statement.
    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought
the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
disclosure of takeover attempts.
    N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee
Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a
five member commission to study the securities industry for a
year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress.
Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.
    "Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of
illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy
of existing surveillance systems and government oversight
operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what
additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed
to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,"
Rinaldo said.

<TITLE>OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC output in February was "well below"
the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries
are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency
Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.
    The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
result "of member countries' firm determination to defend the
organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to
refrain from selling any quantity below that price."
    The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no
OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session
planned to start on June 25.
    The official gave no figure for February output. The
statement said only that "the reduction in total supplies,
namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
those supplies fell very noticeably during that month."
    "No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
financial hardship this may entail," the statement said.
    "The very recent improvement in the price structure is an
indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
the official selling price," the statement said.
    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official
levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.
    There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might
have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled
June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main
markets.
    The official said in the statement that no such emergency
session was scheduled "because of member countries' firm
determination to defend the price (system)" agreed in December.
    Opec"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna
starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no
new date set, according to an official of the United Arab
Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.
    Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya,
Nigeria and Qatar.

<TITLE>HECK'S &lt;HEX> FILES FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NITRO, W.Va., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Heck's Inc said it has filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy act.
    The company said its wholly owned wholesale subsidiaries,
its Maloney's subsidiary and its discount drug store operation
are not included in the filing.
    Heck's said it made the filing because its bank lending
group failed to renew on acceptable terms a credit agreement
that expired February 28.
    It said the 12 banks provided about 50 mln dlrs in credit
lines to Heck's, representing all its short-term borrowings.
    Heck's said some of the banks have demanded repayment.
    The company said another reason for the filing was a
developing shortage in merchandise as suppliers reacted to the
breakdown in bank support.
    Heck's said two representatives of the bank group, Charles
B. Gates Jr. and Walter B. Dial Jr., have left its board.
    Heck's said it is exploring, with its investment banker,
the possibility of selling all or parts of the company.
    It said the filing will allow it to work out arrangements
with suppliers for the delivery of merchandise while permitting
it to continue its previously-announced programs of
cost-cutting and the paring of operations.

<TITLE>U.S. OKAYS USAIR &lt;U> PACIFIC SOUTHWEST PURCHASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Transportation
said it gave final approval to USAir Group's proposed 400 mln
dlr acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines.
    The department said the acquisition is not likely to
substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public
interest.
    The department had given its tentative approval of the
acquisition in January.
    The department said it decided to make final its tentative
decision after reviewing the public response to it.
    The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North
America, which currently is not operating but plans to start
service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the
acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those
markets by other carriers.
    The agency said Air North America provided no support for
its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers
monopoly power in some markets.
    The transportation agency said Air North America also
failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new
entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from
increasing their service.
    The agency noted in its final order that PSA operates
exclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the West
for the most part with some long-haul flights from the East and
Midwest.
    The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles,
San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said.
     The transportation department also rejected a request by
the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to
require protections for PSA workers.
    The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective
benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA
workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such
protections.

Bert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance to
improve in the current quarter compared to the previous
quarter.
    He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance
rate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance but
added: "There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but
we expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."
    The current quarter ends March 31.
    For the fourth quarter, MCI reported a 448 mln dlr loss,
due mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.
    Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, which
had been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission have
had "A significantly negative impact on our profits."
    As reported earlier today, MCI said it plans to ask the FCC
to immediately deregulate ATT, apparently in hopes that an
unregulated ATT would pocket a greater proportion of its
revenues rather than cut rates further.

<TITLE>FINNISH TAXATION MAJOR ISSUE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Verschoor, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 5 -  </DATELINE><BODY>Personal taxation has emerged as the
major economic issue in Finnish general elections later this
month, and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards
indirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more
market-oriented banking practices, economists say.
    Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party, Finland's
second largest, may gain enough clout after the elections to
join a coalition government which is still likely to be
dominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi
Sorsa.
    But the economists point out that Conservative economic
policies differ only slightly from the governments', and that
trade with the Soviet Union will not be affected.
    Helsinki bankers said a new government, including the
Conservatives for the first time in 20 years, could bring about
a shift from direct to indirect taxation.
    The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has
embarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation,
which is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The
opposition has also called for reforms, but they differ over
how to regain lost state revenues.
    One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax
exemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds.
    Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki
(KOP), told Reuters "We want to be more free in setting interest
rates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual
investors. If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer a
system with taxation of real interest gains."
    Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax on
interest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said
this had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering
tougher inter-bank competition.
    A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation
was too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but a
Conservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.
    "It would probably result in new practices that have been
seen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in
Finland," he said, in a reference to money market instruments.
    All parties, especially the Conservatives, have been
careful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue.
Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years
ago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but has
now moderated its stance, political analysts say.
    Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter
system, and is balanced under long-term accords.
    In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth
30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has been
declining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, which
accounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union.
    The bankers said taxation had become the major economic
theme of the campaign because there were few other issues.
    Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in
1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of
the workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct.
    The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign
trade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to
5.04 billion markka.
    Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the
largest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct of
the vote. They currently hold 57 seats.
    The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, is
also expected to hold on to its 37 seats.
    But increased Conservative support and a decline for the
Communists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives
into government. They currently hold 44 seats.

intervene in the U.S. government securities market to add or
drain reserves, economists said.
    Most economists said they did not expect the Fed to add
reserves with Federal funds trading below six pct.
    They said the funds rate's softer tone may indicate that
the need to add reserves in the current bank reserve
maintenance period is smaller than previously estimated.
    Fed funds opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained at that level.
Yesterday funds averaged 6.01 pct.

<TITLE>WRIGHT SAYS TAX RISE NEEDED TO CUT U.S. DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker James Wright said
President Reagan should realize that there will be no way to
meet the deficit reduction targets in the 1988 budget without a
tax increase.
    "In my judgment there isn't any way to achieve the commanded
reductions in the deficit without some additional revenue," the
Texas Democrat told reporters before the opening of the House
session.
    Wright said the Democrats intended to make the additional
tax burden fairer than was Reagan's plan for 22 billion dlrs in
additional revenues in the 1988 budget.
    "It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed, it's
a question of who has to pay," Wright said.
    He has opposed deficit reduction proposals included in
Reagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients,
tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for home
purchases.
    Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut but
has said other options such as a tax on securities transfers
were merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.
    "There has to be a recognition of reality," he said.

<TITLE>OGDEN &lt;OG> DEVICE APPROVED BY U.S. FOR TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ogden Corp said a unit won approval
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to test a bed
combuster, a device that burns some hazardous wastes under
highly controlled conditions.
    The company said the approval will allow its Ogden
Environmental Services unit to operate a pilot scale model of
the device, test the results, and fine tune the instrument to
burn a number of wastes. Testing begins at the end of March.
    The wastes include contaminated soils, chlorinated solvents
such as carbon tetrachloride, non-chlorinated solvents like
toluene, and distillation residues, it said.

<TITLE>ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study of salmonella poisoning has
uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding
antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that
can infect humans and resist medicines.
    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control
tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is
resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the
resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote
the growth of cattle.
    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of
antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have
been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs
is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.
    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases
that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect
humans.
    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.
    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number
of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant
infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to
298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the
victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized
for their illness.
    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always
prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating
raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "the
majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating
hamburger that was at least partially cooked."
    The researchers said the results show that "food animals are
a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections
in humans, and that these infections are associated with
(antibiotic) use on farms."

<TITLE>NATIONAL CONVENIENCE &lt;NCS> TO HAVE 3RD QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Convenience Stores Inc said it
expects to report a loss for the third quarter ending March 31
due to continued poor sales in Texas, especially in Houston.
    In last year's third quarter, National Convenience earned
1,788,000 dlrs or eight cts per share, including a gain of
2,883,000 dlrs from the sale of 186 stores to another operator.
 It said the results also included earnings from gasoline
operations of 2,500,000 dlrs or 11 cts per share caused by
unusually high gross margins on gasoline sales of 12.7 cts per
gallon that were caused by rapidly falling oil prices.
    National Convenience said its third quarter is usually weak
due to winter weather.

<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambian copper production rose 3.2 pct to
113,275 tonnes in fourth quarter 1986 from 109,767 in the same

    A spokesman for the government-controlled mining company
said the country's cobalt production fell 24 pct to 879 tonnes
over the same period, while cobalt sales rose 92 pct to 1,734
tonnes. He did not give figures for the fourth quarter of 1985.
    Lead production fell 22.9 pct to 1,670 tonnes from 2,165

with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the previous year.
    The 1986 losses were after taking into account net interest

<TITLE>U.S. COMMERCE'S ORTNER SAYS YEN UNDERVALUED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Dept. undersecretary of
economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar
at  current levels was fairly priced against most European
currencies.
    In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import
Bank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed
that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.
    "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point
against the yen," he said.
    On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that "the yen
is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10
or 15 pct."
    In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally,
said he thought that the dollar against most European
currencies was "fairly priced."
    Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate
values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate
differentiations.
    Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade
deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the
Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the
first 15 pct decline had little impact.
    He said there were indications now that the trade deficit
was beginning to level off.
    Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it
would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough
foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said
the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined
in Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative.

<TITLE>FARMERS CONCERNED ABOUT BRITISH SUGAR OWNERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains
concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite
last week's decision by the government to block bids from
Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.
    The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider
the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger
Commission, MMC, report issued last week. "We are still
concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of
British Sugar," a spokesman said. "We do not view Berisford as
providing the long-term stability we want."
    The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation
last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S
and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority
of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.
    Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet
processor is now likely. "We are looking again at the
undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and
which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said.
The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers,
is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC
report which it says need further explanation.

<TITLE>DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Raymond Gijsen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaks of a major Dutch official
economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate
reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this
year, political and market sources say.
    Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness
this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage
increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some
calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.
    But whatever the government's response, the central bank
will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.
    The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)
publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will
also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and
the economy.
    Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate
reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch
economic growth was now seen around one pct.
    Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the
decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West
Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,
Pierson said in its February economic outlook.
    The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct
growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of
2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.
    The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the
government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of
reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.
    Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central
bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if
necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.
    Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised
the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in
last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and
expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.
    But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy
had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the
dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.
    Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not
to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead
lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.
    Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move
saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on
the money market, noting "the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the
moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already
far below the market rates."
    Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of
the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest
rate policies serve that goal.
    Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands
recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold
to take profits.
    Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would
reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more
dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch
interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued
completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.
    Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision
not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson
warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.
    Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry
and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having
said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower
Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.
    One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down
to reduce the government debt burden.
    A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were
needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between
the ministry and the central bank. "The cabinet's policy is
steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark," he said.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp said its board declared a
three-for-two stock split in the form of a 50 pct stock
dividend and raised the quarterly dividend by seven pct.
    The company said the dividend was raised to 37.5 cts a
share from 35 cts on a pre-split basis, equal to a 25 ct
dividend on a post-split basis.
    Chrysler said the stock dividend is payable April 13 to
holders of record March 23 while the cash dividend is payable
April 15 to holders of record March 23. It said cash will be
paid in lieu of fractional shares.
    With the split, Chrysler said 13.2 mln shares remain to be
purchased in its stock repurchase program that began in late
1984. That program now has a target of 56.3 mln shares with the
latest stock split.
    Chrysler said in a statement the actions "reflect not only
our outstanding performance over the past few years but also
our optimism about the company's future."

<TITLE>CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended
January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last
year's 697.0 mln dlrs.
    However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
    The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
    Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
calculating first quarter results.
    The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an
agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against
loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal
government's Inspector General of Banks.
    First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest
income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.
    Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to
213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
non-interest expenses and income taxes.
    The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
    Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.
    The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4
billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion
dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from
fiscal 1986 year-end.
    "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of
interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans
to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,
and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings
prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.
    The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on
future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments.

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>World grain trade could be turning
the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a
Cargill, Inc. analyst said.
    Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David
Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a
gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow
rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.
    He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in
many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and
could lead to more activity in other grain markets.
    Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest
level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has
begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their
expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.

<TITLE>NPPC DELEGATES APPROVE DISEASE AND DRUG PROGRAMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Chicago, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Delegates from the National Pork
Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for
control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a
national safe drug use program.
    The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in
Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication
program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's
PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.
    The PRV committee received results of a three year, five
state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in
eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project
was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.
    "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to
deal with their own problems according to a timetable that
suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV
oversight committee said.
    In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan
asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug
use program.
    The program would establish better relationships between
producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality
assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.
    "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are
concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs
safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in
effect," Wehler said.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England again fought against
money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
to.
    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
relieve a money market shortage.
    "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said
Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."
    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
strongly into the pound.
    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
marks, up from 2.8720/50.
    "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist
at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
for bonds, Fellner said.
    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year.
    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
current political upheavals in Washington.
    The Bank may want to see another few points on the
trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by
then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
England," he added.
    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
    This was above previous estimates of the current account
deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

Japan if the Japanese do not permit U.S. construction firms to
participate in building the eight billion dlr Kansai airport.
    But he said he had a personal commitment from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that U.S. firms would have a
chance at the work.
    "I think he will honor that commitment," Baldrige told the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce affairs."
    He said one form of retaliation could be to curb Japanese
firms' two billion dlr construction work in the United States.

    Officials say Egypt can produce up to one mln bpd per day,
but production was cut when world prices plunged last year.
    In an attempt to help OPEC stabilize the world market,
Egypt cut its 1987 production target of 940,000 bpd to its
current output of 870,000 bpd.
    Egypt, which exports a third of its output, currently sells
its top Suez and Ras Bahar blends for 17.25 dlrs a barrel.

authorized redemption on April 17 of its 4-3/4 pct and five pct

    The Chrysler Corp unit said the move is prompted by the

<TITLE>POLISH TRADE OFFICIAL CALLS FOR FREER MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Janusz
Kaczurba told Reuters that Poland would have to diverge from
traditional Communist bloc centrally-planned economic policies
if it wanted to bring about economic renewal and compete in
world markets.
    Stressing his commitment to a series of reforms recently
introduced to streamline the economy and boost export-oriented
industry, he also called for an expansion in the role of the
private sector.
    Asked whether the policies the government was advocating
did not represent a departure from the strictly controlled
economic model within the Soviet bloc, he said in an interview
with Reuters "I don't see any alternative but to try to proceed
along the lines of economic reasoning."
    He referred specifically to bankruptcies, which he said
would be "the logical outcome of a more stringent economic
policy," once the state stopped propping up enterprises to
guarantee jobs, regardless of how inefficient they were.
    He added, "We should follow the policy of creating a system
whereby managers will be really responsible for the overall
economic effect of enterprises. This can be done in one way
only, through the reduction of subsidies."
    But he also noted the need to curtail bureaucracy of branch
ministries, allow domestic prices to reflect the world market,
make foreign exchange rates more realistic, provide incentives
to export-oriented industry and encourage private business.
    Kaczurba was talking to Reuters about the effect on the
economy of U.S. Sanctions imposed in 1982 in response to the
suppression of the Solidarity trade union under martial law.
    He acknowledged that Poland's economic decline would add to
its problems in trying to regain markets and support from
Western creditors even after Washington lifted remaining
restrictions and restored Most Favoured Nation trading status
last month.
     Western officials say Polish goods have to be more
competitive and of better quality in the face of trade wars and
protectionism amongst U.S., Japanese and European competitors.
    Reaffirming the government's view that the key to solving
some of those problems and meeting payments on a 33.5 billion
dlr foreign debt lay in increasing hard currency exports,
Kaczura said private enterprise could play a greater role.
    "I think we could have some 20,000 small private enterprises
active in export-oriented business if such operators are
successfully convinced that the policy towards the (private)
sector is stabilised," he said.
    Poland already has a more developed private sector than
most other East European countries.
    Among economic reforms already under way, Kaczurba listed
easier access to hard currency profits, tax incentives, access
to investment credits and two devaluations of the zloty to
increase competitivity of prices.
    He said such policies had been welcomed by the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund, through which Poland is hoping
to gain new credits, but Poles were caught in a "vicious circle."
    Creditors wanted proof that the policies were directed
towards improving exports, but in order to fulfil their
expectations Poland first needed fresh inputs, he said.

<TITLE>TURKEY SEEKING 100,000 TONNES SUGAR - TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey is holding a buying tender for
100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.
    The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will
probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.
    Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement
from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes
of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease
the amount.
    Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported
between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and
between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.
    Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts
said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue
filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.
    Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish
1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln
in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three
seasons.
    The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish
Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey
would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the
same amount.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman John Shad said the SEC favors shortening the current
10-day period for disclosing takeover attempts but opposes
putting restrictions on the use of so-called junk bonds.
    "We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days,"
Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance
subcommittee when asked for his recommendation.
    He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full
disclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not to
make decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had some
value because of their liquidity.
    Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attempting
takeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover would
have on the communities involved.
    "We've opposed it in the past. It goes far beyond investor
protection," Shad said.
    He said he had no comment on a proposal by House Speaker
Jim Wright, D- Texas, to tax securities transactions.

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT> SAYS BAKER &lt;BKO> MERGER ALIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler
said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
company. "We're working very hard on this merger."
    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
    "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explaining
why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
    "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
accept our proposal."
    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was not
a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    The Justice Department in January said it would block the
Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    Baker said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

<TITLE>FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, France, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French government is to
sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe
Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale
Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL
officials said.
    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
regional operation, Geronimus said.
    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
reserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operation
and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France," he said.
    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the
first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its
Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign
banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.
    The government's banking adviser for the operation was
&lt;Banque Privee de Gestion Financiere>, BPGF, owned by French
financier Pierre Moussa's &lt;Pallas> group, assisted by Britain's
&lt;Hambros Bank Ltd>.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     BY SUSAN ZEIDLER, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retailers posted stronger than
expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
first half of 1987.
     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
Greenstein.
    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
   Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
3.6 pct increase last year.
     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
transitory month between winter and spring.
    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
by severe weather.
    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
according to retailers and analysts.
    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
high levels of consumer debt.
     May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were
among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
last month.
    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"
said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
    Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
&lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were
strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
than a year ago.
    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel
Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it has
acquired an 18.7 pct equity interest in Enzon Inc, a
pharmaceutical company specializing in protein therapy.
    Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three
of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity
disorders, hyperuricemia and gout.
    The company said it acquired two mln Enzon shares for 15
mln dlrs, with loans to Enzon of two mln dlrs and interest of
30,000 dlrs credited against the purchase price.
    Kodak said the drugs covered by the marketing rights are in
initial stages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval process.  It said the investment should provide the
necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and
provide a marketing outlet for the drugs.
    The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase,
for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the
often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ
transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for
treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of
high levels of uric acid in the body.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON STRESSES PRICE STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was
critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the
world and said that progress was being made.
    "It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's
promotion of price stability is critical to the successful
implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients
for growth," he told the Eastern Economic Association.
    Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of
fronts. "Federal Reserve monetary policy, the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the
Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the
right direction," he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,
France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.
    On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise
numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment
toward slowing the growth of federal spending.
    There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National
Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.
    But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign
capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep
interest rates stable.
    "This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.
Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive
federal spending," he said.
    A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the
main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.
    He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of
exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.
    On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against "quick fix"
solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation
or protectionist trade legislation.
    "What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy
returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine
economic growth," he said.
    Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow
for its gradual resolution over time.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY SAYS NO COMMENT ON YEN VALUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Treasury Department spokesman
refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary
of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the
Japanese yen was undervalued.
    Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told
an Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bit
undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."
    Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials
were aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of making
any comment on them.
    Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said
he thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced"
against most European currencies and added "I do not regard the
dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.
    But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner
said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.
    The United States and major trade allies West Germany,
France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to
discuss maintaining stability in international currency values.

    Cornelissen said Royal Trust, Canada's second biggest trust
company, was concerned about a possible conflict of interest
between its current asset management functions and brokerage
and stock promotion activities.
    Cornelissen also cited the heavy competition in the
Canadian securities industry as a factor in Royal Trust's
decision to avoid direct involvement in a brokerage firm.
    He told shareholders, however, that Royal Trust would
continue to compete with investment dealers through its asset
management programs and discount processing of retail stock
trades.
    Royal Trust also plans to take further advantage of
networking possibilities offered by its involvement in
financial conglomerate &lt;Trilon Financial Corp>, 50 pct-owner of
Royal Trust, Cornelissen said.
    Afterward, Cornelissen told reporters that Royal Trust's
Dow Financial Services Corp unit planned no more divestitures
after its previously reported agreement yesterday to
restructure its financial operations in Asia with joint owner
&lt;MBF Holdings Ltd>.
    Cornelissen also told reporters the company was confident
of achieving its targeted 15 pct growth in earnings per share
this year. Royal Trust's basic per share earnings rose 16 pct
in 1986 to 2.20 dlrs.
    "With two months of the year gone, we are ahead of it (the
15 pct growth target)," he said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cadbury-Schweppes Plc &lt;CADB.L> said it
had asked the London Stock Exchange to launch a formal enquiry
into dealings in the company's shares in recent months.
    It said it believed such a move was in the best interests
of shareholders following recent charges being made under U.K.
Insider dealing laws about the shares.
    Last week, former &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> executive
Geoffrey Collier was charged with insider dealing in Cadbury
shares.
    Collier resigned from the bank last year and was later
charged with offences on deals in shares of AE Plc &lt;AENG.L>.
    A Stock Exchange spokeswoman said she could give no
specific details about the request. An investigation would be
requested from the Exchange as it had access to the relevant
dealing records.
    If it appeared that some offence had been committed details
would be passed to the U.K. Trade Department, which had the
power to bring charges under the Companies' Act.
    No spokesman for Cadbury was immediately available for
comment.

LIBRA BANK EXPECTS BRAZIL TO REACH DEBT ACCORD LONDON, March 5
- London-based &lt;Libra Bank Plc> said when announcing its 1986
annual results that it expected Brazil to reach agreement with
its creditors over debt repayments.
    "In recent years Brazil has demonstrated its ability to
generate surpluses sufficient to service its debt, and I have
no doubt that, in due course, it will reach an agreement with
the banks and its other creditors," Libra managing director
Peter Belmont said in a statement.
    Earlier the bank, which specialises in providing finance to
Latin America and the Caribbean, announced pretax profits of
43.9 mln stg for calendar 1986, against 43 mln in 1985.
    Libra's net worth increased by 24 pct to 134 mln stg last
year, and Belmont said the improvement to the bank's balance
sheet was due to profits being mostly retained in the bank, and
to the issue of 10 mln stg of cumulative redeemable preference
shares during the year.
    Libra is a consortium bank --National Westminster Bank Plc
&lt;NWBL.L>, Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. &lt;CMB>, Royal Bank of Canada
&lt;RY.TO>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z>, Westdeutsche Landesbank

downgraded 225 mln dlrs of debt of Beverly Enterprises.
    Cut were the company's senior debt to BB-minus from BB and
subordinated debt to B-plus from BB-minus. The implied senior
secured debt rating is BB.
    S and P said the action reflected Beverly's aggressive
plans to repurchase stock that would increase financial risk
while earnings prospects become more clouded.
    Despite the planned use of proceeds from asset sales for a
portion of the buy back's costs, decapitalization would raise
adjusted debt leverage above the 75 pct level of recent years.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL PROMISES VACCINE AID PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration soon will
propose a program of no-fault compensation for people injured
by childhood vaccines, a senior Treasury Department counsel
told the House select revenue measures subcommittee.
    "Within the next few weeks, we expect to propose a program
that will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injured
persons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities for
vaccine manufacturers," Dennis Ross, tax legislative counsel for
treasury, said in prepared testimony.
    The Vaccine Act was signed into law last year but did not
include a funding mechanism for its compensation program.
    Ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer serious
long-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine for
diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.
    But he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like Wyeth
Laboratories and Parke, Davis and Co to stop producing
childhood vaccines.
    The administration would not favor funding compensation
through an excise tax levied on the vaccine producers because
it would add to collection and auditing burdens, Ross said.
    He did not suggest a favored funding mechanism but said
a lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable.

<TITLE>ICI &lt;ICI> SEES GROWTH IN PHARMACEUTICALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow  
to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years
compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson
told financial analysts.
    "Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new
product each year," Henderson said.
    He also said research and development spending in this
business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales
income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.
    ICI, the world's fifth largest chemicals firm in terms of
sales, recently reported 1986 profits of about 888 mln dlrs on
15 billion dlrs in sales, compared with income of 817 mln dlrs
on 15.87 billion dlrs in sales a year earlier.
    Sales in the United States totaled about three billion
dlrs, ICI executives said.
    In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will
come from ICI's research and development activities, but the
company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition
program.
    ICI spent just under one billion dlrs for acquisitions
during 1986, the largest of which was the 580 mln dlr purchase
of Cleveland, Ohio-based Glidden Inc, a paints, resins and
coatings company, from &lt;Hanson Trust PLC>.
    ICI financial director Alan Clements said the company's
borrowing limits are at a level of about 6.3 billion sterling,
1.5 billion of which have already been used.
    While the company has no current plans for a major
acquisition, "we are ready to move quickly in the acquisition
field if the need arises," Clements said.

<TITLE>ROTTERDAM PORT SUBSIDY TO END JULY 1 - MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de
Graaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder
labour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sector
as from July 1.
    Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not
settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.
    The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,
Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and
added there was now no alternative to proceeding with
redundancy plans.
    The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19
in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from
the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.
    Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss
figures given for the port for this year.
    The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,
put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985
at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around
30 mln.
    The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and
said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their
plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.

expects a loss of about two mln dlrs in its third quarter ended

    S.A.Y said its board of directors approved the unit's sale
because Omnilab was losing about 140,000 dlrs a quarter.
    "We no longer see a near-term prospect for a reasonable
return on our investment," Romilly Humphries, S.A.Y. president

    S.A.Y. said proceeds from the sale would be used to
increase the company's market share in automotive products
packaging and diversify its packaging capabilities.

managment contract.
    It said the Lodge at Vail, Colo., will be sold and leased

<TITLE>STRIKING BRAZILIAN SEAMEN HOLD PAY TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Striking Brazilian seamen, who say
they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports,
today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister
Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said.
    Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National
Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks
would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.
    Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.
    The union official said the strike had halted a total of
158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and
about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.
    Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,
Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.
    Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to
the government, which has already had to suspend interest
payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic
deterioration in the country's trade balance.
    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo
Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil
newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships
could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.
    "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is
not conceivable that exports be hit," he said.
    "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are
going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad,
and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbema
said.
    A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the
scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said
movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its
normal level of 12 ships a day.
    He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor
on moored in the harbour.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON WARNS U.S. BANKS ON LDC RIGIDITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said that some U.S. banks have been too rigid in
talks with lesser developed countries on debt refinancings and
warned that a breakdown of the renegotiation process could be
harmful.
    "There have been some difficulties in those negotiations ...
banks have sometimes been too rigid," Johnson said in response
to a question during an address before the Eastern Economic
Association, an academic group.
    "I think there have been potential breakdowns in that
process," he said, adding that an actual breakdown "would be very
unfortunate."
    He declined to comment on the situation of specific nations
and said it was not the Fed's role to become involved in such
talks.
    However, he said it was "always a little bit risky" for a
heavily indebted nation to seek refinancing without first
negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on economic
reforms. He added that he remains optimistic that current talks
would be resolved successfully.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON SEES RISKS IN DEBT LOAD GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said the rapid recent growth in corporate and
household debt burdens posed risks to the economy but should be
kept in perspective.
    The heavy debt load "is one of our major concerns ... the
risks are significant," he said in response to questions from
the Eastern Economic Association, an academic group.
    However, he added, the recent bull market on Wall Street
had also made corporate equity levels soar, keeping corporate
debt to equity ratios about constant.
    Similarly, he said household net worth has increased at a
faster pace than household debt "so that household debt-to-asset
ratios have once again gone down."
    Nonetheless, "I think that it's something to watch
carefully, and obviously it's something we do," he said.

<TITLE>YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A reduction of the U.S. federal budget
deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge
trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly
inter-releated now.
    "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the
trade deficit down."
    He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between
the two deficits.
    Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.
budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas
investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser
extent, other U.S. securities as well.
    "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr
trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"
Yeutter said.
    He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and
focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary
policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and
the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.
    The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve
under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the
trade situation by getting interest rates down.
    On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is
still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough
progress toward reducing that deficit.
    In the international area, he said that "our major trading
partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."
Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr
trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is
just not doing the job on the import side."
    Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the
dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of
Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.
    In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored
meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels
was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that
the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.
    "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the
end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and
other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.
trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."
    Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and
any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation
or trade restrictions poses real dangers.
    He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to
legislate a solution to the trade problem."
    Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by
U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.
    "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our
trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade
legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is
essential in solving international trade problems.

<TITLE>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before Plaza," he said.
    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK HEAD SAYS BRAZIL MORATORIUM TEMPORARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank president Barber Conable
said he believed that Brazil would come up with a medium term
economic plan and that the current debt moritorium would be
temporary.
    Speaking briefly to reporters following an address before
the Export-Import Bank, Conable said that the bank had been
urging the Brazilian government to come up with a specific plan
designed to work the country out of its present economic
difficulty.
    "Brazil would like to come up with such a plan," he said,
adding: "the moritorium is likely to be a temporary affair."
    During his formal remarks, Conable made it clear that he
believed Brazil must take some specific internal action.
    He said "they have everyone's attention but it must be
followed by a construtive plan."
    He said that he expected Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro, who he met with last week to discuss the Brazilian debt
suspension action, to return for further discussion but did not
currently have a specific meeting arranged.
    Conable also told the gathering of mostly commericial
bankers that in order for the Baker debt initiative to work all
parties to the program must be on board.

<TITLE>TANDEM COMPUTERS &lt;TNDM> SEES HIGHER NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tandem Computers Inc said it expects
higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter
ending March 31 against a year ago.
    "We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the
quarter," James Treybig, president and and chief executive
officer, told a meeting of securities analysts.
    In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned
9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln
dlrs.
    Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the
quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for
the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln
dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is
traditionally slower than the first.
    L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen
estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per
share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker
to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned
1.44 dlrs a share.
    Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company,
said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United
States. "The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions
are being made. We didn't see that a year ago," he said.
    The executive said Tandem will increase its research and
development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87
mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.
    He said the company plans to introduce several products,
including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL
programming language, an industry standard. Tandem also won a
major order from the &lt;Bank of Tokyo>.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
on agricultural trade.
    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
    "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
agriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.
    "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told the
meeting.
    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
justification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. He
listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
peanuts, cotton and sugar.
    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the
GATT, told Reuters: "These charges have been made since the very
beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural
policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT".
    "We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
their programs. We can negotiate them all," Samuels added.
    Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay
round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.
Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,
tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as
manufactured goods.

<TITLE>VW EXPECTS FURTHER FALL IN U.S. SALES IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> expects
currency factors to cause a further drop in its U.S. Sales in
1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the United States in
1986, board member Karl-Heinz Briam said.
    Briam, who described the current situation of the U.S.
Market as critical, also said VW was uncertain whether it would
be able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 European sales.
    In 1986 the VW group, which includes Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>,
delivered a record 981,000 vehicles to European markets outside
of West Germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, Briam told a
regular quarterly meeting of the Wolfsburg plant's workforce.
    Briam said sales conditions in Europe had generally become
more difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates and
fiercer competition in the region.
    Briam gave no forecast for VW domestic sales. But he said
car sales in West Germany for all manufacturers combined would
probably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record
2.73 mln because car sales in West Germany had likely passed
their peak for this business cycle.
    Summing up his predictions, Briam said limits to growth
were becoming apparent on the VW group's most important markets
but there were no grounds for great worries.
    The automobile industry, as far as VW was concerned, had
entered its fourth consecutive good year, with VW's incoming
orders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said.
    Briam, who is VW's director of labour relations, also said
VW currently had no plans for further increases in its
workforce.
    He told the plant's workforce that an
internationally-active company like VW must be able to adjust
to changed economic conditions and manage situations in which
unfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financial
maneuver.
    Briam said VW needed to hold and expand market share in
order to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some of
its foreign competitors, particularly those in the Far East.
    This could only be done if capital-intensive plants were
used as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications were
raised through comprehensive training and if working hours were
arranged so that expensive production plants operated as
efficiently and soundly as possible.
    The metalworkers union IG Metall has said it plans to push
for a 35-hour working week in its sector of West Germany
industry this year.
    Walter Hiller, the chairman of VW's works council, told the
same Wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35
hours was necessary to help reduce unemployment.
    He said the works council was prepared to negotiate on
making working hours more flexible to suit the needs of both
the company and the workforce.
    A seven-week strike by IG Metall in the summer of 1984 for
a 35-hour week in the West German metal industry ended in a
compromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed each
company in the industry to decide, in consultation with the
workforce, how the reductions should be made.

    FMG said all expenditures and payments are in Canadian

<TITLE>HAUGHEY TO SEEK EC ADVICE ON IRISH DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charles Haughey, leader of the Irish
party Fianna Fail, said if he becomes prime minister following
last month's Irish general election, he will seek the advice of
the EC Commission on management of the country's 24 billion
punt foreign debt.
    Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being
asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next
Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17
poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt
management was made to him today by Commission president
Jacques Delors.
    Haughey said:" Delors assured me we could have full recourse
to the Commission for advice, guidance and expert skills in
dealing with our overall financial problems, particularily in
the matter of debt management."
    Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion
punts a year, he added :"If we could achieve any significant
improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of
servicing, it could have significant budgetary benefits."
    He added that he would seek advice, not a Community loan.
    However, Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its
position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at
favorable interest rates, notably for onlending to its farming
sector.
    "It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before
and we would look at it again," he said.
     Haughey said he regarded as "almost paramount" the
maintenance of the punt's current position within the European
Monetary System.
    He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government
in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight
pct last August.
    "Until 1983, the policy of the Irish government was to was
to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I
believe that policy was right," Haughey said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A House Agriculture Committee meeting
later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources
said.
    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
the bill, committee staffers said.
    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A
conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.
    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.
    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the
consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
necessary.
    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn
Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's
Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
should be extended to other crops.
    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce
a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
changes in the farm bill.
    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
timing," a congressional staff member said.
    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an
amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
feedgrains.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for
USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
which was being courted by USAir.
    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4
billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
accepting the bid.
    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
it would be taken over.
    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
   "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.
    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
succeed.
    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
least likely to be bought.
    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
contingencies.
    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
    "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.
    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
serious by following through with his threats or making a new
offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
price if USAir rejected his offer.
    "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said
one arbitrager.
    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
about six dlrs per share.
    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
acquired separately.
    "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
work," said one analyst.
    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
analysts said.
    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
    However, other analysts speculated the managements of
Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
into TWA.

<TITLE>BAKER INT'L &lt;BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Baker International Corp treasurer Eric
Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed
merger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what
compromises might be acceptable to it.
    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr
oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when
Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent
decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.
    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting
called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said
it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.
    Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did
not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until
after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were
sold.
    Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was
possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.
    "The company's position is we would like to see the merger
be completed, which is in the best interests of our
shareholders and their shareholders," Mattson said.
    "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the
litigation, I can't go any further than that," he said.
    Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday
to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent
decree.
    Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directors
of Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the
merger.

<TITLE>TRW &lt;TRW> PROMISES TO CORRECT CONTRACT PRACTICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of TRW, inc said his
company had overcharged the government on defense contracts but
promised to prevent the improper conduct from recurring.
    "There were a number of instances of mischarging and other
irregularities in TRW's defense contracting business," TRW
chairman Ruben Mettler said in testimony to the House Oversight
subcommittee.
    "As the person ultimately responsible for the management of
TRW, I am determined to do everything in my power to prevent
any recurrence," Mettler said.
    TRW holds over 3 billion dlrs in defense contracts.
    Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,
said TRW was being sued by the Justice Department and was being
investigated by federal grand juries in Colorado and Cleveland.
    Mettler said the overcharges had been uncovered by TRW's
internal procedures and all were reported to the government.
    "In every case we advised the government of our findings and
committed to make restitution. We immediately put a stop to the
practices in question and disciplined those who were culpable,"
he said.
    Mettler said TRW had hired a new chief financial officer, a
vice president of internal audit and a corporate controller. He
said the internal audit department was being strengthened and a
corporate review board had been established to monitor
compliance activities.
    He said a business ethics and conduct council had also been
created and over 15,000 managers and employees would be given
training programs on contract compliance.

<TITLE>OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman
said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been
delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec
prices.
    Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from
Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in
February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were
strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"
he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they
are committed to making the accord work," he said.
    Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He
said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these
figures.
    Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated
that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
said; "That could well be correct."
    Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying
group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it
gave no figures.
    But one source close to Opec indicated that February output
may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around
16 mln bpd.
    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.
    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all
produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said
it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December
pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
    Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that
in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
country were coming under price pressure because they were
currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and
the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.
    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that
demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
    "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is
now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he
expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after
early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand
for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.
    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela
and Indonesia were having less problems with output than
producers like his own country because they exported oil
products.
    Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec
pricing system, he said.
    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually
have to buy Opec oil.
    "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
later on," he said.
    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being
pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
seemed weak.
    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority
for Opec at the moment.
    "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said.
"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is
working, not dealing with a differential of cents between
grades."
    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over
the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON SEES INTEREST RATES STABLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said he does not see increasing pressure on
interest rates but said the Fed would watch out for
developments that could push them higher.
    Johnson said that it was too early to tell if recent
indicators on the economy contradicted Fed expectations of
continued modest growth.
    "We are not anticipating any problems or see increased
interest rate pressures," Johnson told reporters after a speech
to the Eastern Economic Association.
    However, Johnson said the Fed would be alert to an
excessive depreciation in the dollar, a rise in bond yields,
increases in commodity prices, or other variables.
    "We would have to pay attention," he said.
    Recent indicators on retail sales and factory orders that
indicated weakness in the economy could be presenting an
inaccurate picture, Johnson said.
    The more recent data are too caught up in statistical
adjustment problems having to do with the end of the year and
the beginning of the year, he said.
    Asked if the Fed was continuing to be generous with
reserves, Johnson said, "We have accommodated reasonable,
non-inflationary real growth."
    He said the Fed was able to do that because of the decline
in inflation expectations and monetary velocity.
    "I don't think we can be accused of being too generous," he
added.

<TITLE>U.S HOUSE LEADER URGES FARM CREDIT RECUE CAUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Majority leader Thomas Foley
(D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system a
few more months to reorganize itself before rushing into a
federal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said.
    Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, told
Reuters that while Foley believes action will be necessary
later this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is not
necessarily needed immediately.
    Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadership
who have said they hope to have farm credit legislation under
consideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9.
    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,
last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren said
his subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system's
regulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the system
itself ask for aid.
    Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has 
expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering to
wait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reform
itself, farm credit sources said.

introduced a bill to create an international debt adjustment
facility to deal with third world debt.
    He said in a statement the facility would purchase debt of

private investors. LaFalce said the facility could use funds of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as collateral to
for the necessary financial banking to issue debt instruments.
    LaFalce, a member of the House Banking Committee, said the
facility was needed because most American banks were refusing
to fund more foreign debt and debtor countries were having
trouble paying the loans on schedule.

<TITLE>CUBAN CATTLE THREATENED BY DROUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAVANA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering
the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a
prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle
producing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.
    The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the
island's number two province in milk production. Granma said
20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.
    The newspaper said a "cattle emergency" had been decreed and
the cattle are being rounded up.
    Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane
conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned
before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the
residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have
been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.
    Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef
rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana,
each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every
18 days.
    In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no
rain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are
parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of
silage projected in its annual plan.
    Granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than
50 pct of normal precipitation.

<TITLE>U.S. TO SET ORANGE JUICE DUTIES MONDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commerce Department on Monday
will set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from
Brazil, department officials said.
    A preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set last Oct 17 on the
imports, which run at about 700 mln dlrs a year. Commerce's
ruling on Monday will reset the duties on the basis of more
detailed cost information, industry officials said.
    The duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis,
pending a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) on whether the imports are injuring the
domestic orange industry.
    The ITC ruled provisionally last June 18 that the domestic
industry was being injured by Brazilian orange juice imports.
    A complaint that the Brazilian imports were being dumped at
below costs on the U.S. market was filed on behalf of U.S.
growers by the Florida Citrus Mutual, a Lakeland, Fla., group,
Alcoma Packing Co, Inc, and Barry Citrus Products.
    U.S. officials say about half of the orange juice consumed
in the United States comes from Brazil.

occupant protection systems" on all cars beyond the current
September, 1989, target.
    GM previously said it would offer airbags as optional

<TITLE>RADTECH &lt;RADT> BOARD REMOVES CHAIRMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Radtech Inc said its board has
removed Ronald G. Williams as chairman and chief executive
officer and has elected President Samuel A. Francis chief
exeuctive officer.
    Williams is the majority owner of &lt;Forum Cos Inc>. On
December 12, Radtech exchanged 10 mln of its shares for 20,000
Forum shares. Of the 10 mln, 7.5 mln went to Williams and 2.5
mln to Forum's other owner, &lt;Audley Inc>. In addition to the 10
mln shares involved in this transaction, Radtech has 9.9 mln
shares outstanding.
    On January 27, Radtech said, it announced an agreement to
rescind the Forum transaction.
    Radtech said six mln of its shares held by Williams and the
20,000 Forum shares were turned over to Radtech's attorney's.
Subsequent to the rescission agreement, however, Williams and
Audley have refused to recognize Radtech's position that a
recission has occurred, it said.
    On March 3, the company said, its attorneys filed an action
in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico
giving control of both blocks of stock to the court and asking
it to rule on the recission.
    Radtech said it intends to defend its position in the legal
proceeding, which names the company, Williams and Audley, that
the rescission has occurred, that all 10 mln shares it issued
should be returned, and that the 600,000 dlrs of Radtech funds
used by Forum should be returned.
    The company also said a dispute exists whether Williams
continues to serve on its board.

<TITLE>CANADA DLR DRIVEN BY FOREIGN BUYERS - WILSON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson said
large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the
country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp
recovery in the Canadian dollar.
    He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and
the United States, is the result of "confidence in the
direction this country is going in."
    "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is
higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when
it was) a little over 69 cts," Wilson told the House of Commons
daily question period.
    Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a
record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than
double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5
billion dlrs in the market.
    Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a
possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment
abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign
companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from
6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would
generate many new jobs in Canada.

<DATELINE>    HAMMOND, Ind., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northern Indiana Public Service Co
said its five-year construction budget for 1987-1991 will be
793 mln dlrs, almost all of which will be internally generated.
    The utility said in its 1986 annual report that this
budget, primarily for electric and gas equipment and
facilities, is some 57 mln dlrs lower than its estimate a year
ago of spending for 1986-1990. Such spending at its peak was
2.6 billion dlrs for 1980-1984.
    It said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will probably not have a
material effect on its operating results. In December it cut
59.4 mln dlrs from a 135.8 mln dlrs rate request before the
Indiana Public Service Commission because of the affect the tax
act will have on operating results.
    The rate request is still pending, a spokesman said.

<TITLE>CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top U.S. and European farm trade and
government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
imbalance.
    Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
production.
    "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
Administrator William Bailey said.
    Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
    The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance
and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
Jean-Claude Paye said.
    And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
    Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
    Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
    Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
    However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to
take account of large disparities in the situation around the
EC, he said.
    "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
Community," he said.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA WILL REPROGRAM SIX BILLION DLRS IN DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's recent agreement with its
creditor banks reprograms six billion dlrs of its 21 billion
dlr public sector foreign debt rescheduling and reduces
repayments due between 1987 and 1992, Finance Minister Manuel
Azpurua said.
    Azpurua was commenting in a television interview on
Friday's agreement to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over
Libor from 1-1/8 pct and extend the period to 14 years from
12-1/2.
    He said in addition to the reduction in amortizations over
the next three years sought by the government, agreed at 1.35
billion dlrs instead of 3.335 billion, Venezuela will also pay
less in the subsequent three years. The accord runs till 1999.
    Azpurua said that in 1990, payments of restructured debt
are lowered to 1.05 billion dlrs from 1.339 mln, to 1.25
billion from 1.994 mln in 1991 and to 1.45 billion from 2.403
billion in 1992.
    He said the contingency clause implemented by Venezuela
soon after the original rescheduling was signed in February
1986 stays in effect and that the new payment schedule is based
on an assumption of oil prices varying between 15 and 18 dlrs a
barrel.
    Venezuela, hit by a 40 pct drop in oil income last year,
had sought a direct link between repayments and the level of
oil income, but banks resisted on the grounds this could create
a dangerous precedent for other Latin American debtors.
    Azpurua said the new terms have been telexed to Venezuela's
450 creditor banks for acceptance with information on
government plans to draw up debt capitalization rules and
return to the capital markets.
    Public finances director Jorge Marcano said the government
plans to issue dollar, mark and yen denominated bonds this year
for amounts varying between 100 and 150 mln dlrs.
    He noted that some existing Republic of Venezuela bond
issues are maturing, and that the government intends to replace
them with new issues to maintain its presence in the capital
markets and encourage new investments through an enhanced
credit image.

    The bill contains a provision implementing a 0/92 acreage
reduction plan for 1986 wheat and 1987 winter wheat, thereby
making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant
last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding.
    Controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the
bill should be expanded, cut back or left as is.

(D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system a
few more months to reorganize itself before rushing into a
federal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said.
    Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, told
Reuters while Foley believes action will be necessary later
this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is not
necessarily needed immediately.
    Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadership
who have said they hope to have farm credit legislation under
consideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9.
    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,
last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren said
his subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system's
regulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the system
itself ask for aid.
    Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has 
expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering to
wait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reform
itself, farm credit sources said.
    "He (Foley) is willing to give Mr. Naylor some time in this
regard," Moos said.
    Moos predicted Congress will begin serious action on a
rescue package sometime this summer. Any package of legislation
is unlikely to include large federal outlays of money, he said.
    "I  don't see a big infusion of federal bucks," said Moos,
adding that the more likely outcome will be federal guarantees
of borrower stock and bonds held by investors.

<TITLE>UNION CARBIDE &lt;UK> SAYS LONG TERM DEBT RISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DANBURY, Conn., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Carbide Corp said its 1986
long term debt was 3.06 billion dlrs compared to 1.71 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    The company released its audited 1986 results.
    The company also said its long term debt was reduced by
about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the
year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold
its battery products, home and automobile products and
agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth
quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650
mln dlrs.
    The asset sales and equity offering were part of a
recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last
year.
    Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a
share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were
unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made
on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were
also unchanged.
    Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from
sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit
and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term
debt at a premium under the recapitalization.
    In the audited results released today, the company broke
down results by business segment.
    Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the
company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate
and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss
of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.
    In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to
a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.
    In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile
takeover attempt, by GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, and recapitalized the
company, adding, "While all this was going on, our continuing
businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating
profit improvement over 1985."
    Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs
in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the
year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.
    Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit
of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In
the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against
losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs
from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in
the year.
    The company's specialties and services segment cut its
losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in
the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.
    Eliminations of business conducted between the company's
industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter
1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The
eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six
mln dlrs in the year.
    The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual
writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the
quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.
    Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501
mln dlrs.
    By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs
from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services
to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs.
    At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln
dlrs from 133 mln and at industrial gases they rose to 209 mln
dlrs from 168 mln dlrs.
    The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at
year end from 430 mln dlrs at year end 1985, after a net
decrease of 131 mln dlrs during 1986.
    Current assets at year-end fell to 2.41 billion dlrs from
4.43 billion dlrs and current liabilities fell to 1.88 billion
dlrs from 2.38 billion.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shell Francaise &lt;SFMF.PA>, a subsidiary of
&lt;Shell Petroleum NV>, returned to the black last year for the
first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln
francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in
1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.
    The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved
strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs
against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved
performances by its main profit centres.
    It said the results could have been even better had it not
been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in
the last quarter of the year.
    In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against
14.52 mln tonnes in 1985.
    The company said the results were in line with its targets
for the second year of its three-year recovery programme.
    Meanwhile, &lt;Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to
profit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net
profit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln. No
other details were available.

<TITLE>PORK DELEGATES VOTE ON FARM BILL, FARM CREDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Delegates from the National Pork
Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress
in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S.
congress not to change the farm bill. While there are no
specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices
directly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said.
    Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said "to have
unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very
difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption."
    Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but
that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for
legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.
    Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that
Congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify
problems in the farm credit system.
    Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice
President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a
program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a 
resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.
    Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will
work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save
or create any one credit system.

<TITLE>CONFIDENCE IN OPEC FIRMS U.S. ENERGY FUTURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Renewed confidence in OPEC's ability to
limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above
yesterday's closing prices, according to analysts.
    They also said the heating oil contract found additional
support from a short-covering rally on the close.
    April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April
heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.
    "Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from
yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that
OPEC is producing within its quota," said Simon Greenshields, a
vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.
    News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman
statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its
official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices,
traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early
March was 14.7 mln bpd.
    In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support
from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as
well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as
refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.
    Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to
51.24 cts a gallon.

<TITLE>USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in
the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since
August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's
level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said
sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported
under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for
delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR
Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.
    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales
to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.
    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and
151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from
the previous week's combined sales, it said.
    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for
delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by
30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000
tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the
preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week
average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico
and Italy, it said.
    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4
times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less
than the four week average.
    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and
Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown
destinations.
    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of
increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for
unknown destinations.
    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales
-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the
1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good
showing, the department said.
    Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea,
Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, while South Korea and Indonesia
were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season, which begins
August 1.

may downgrade Duquesne Light Co's two billion dlrs of debt.
    Moody's said it would assess the likely financial
consequences of the 19 mln dlr rate reduction ordered today by
the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
    The unexpected order raises significant doubts about the
quality of Duquesne's regulatory support and financial
prospects. The Commission's determination that Perry Unit 1's
power is not needed could depress Duquesne's earnings and cash
flow well into the future. Duqusne has Baa-1 senior debt and
preferred stock and Baa-2 debentures and preference stock.

<TITLE>COFFEE FALL NOT SEEN AFFECTING COLOMBIA'S DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The sharp fall in international coffee
prices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation,
finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.
    He said the current depression on world coffee markets was
not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
Colombia's financial state which he described as sound.
    "Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the
foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"
he said.
    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have
rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt
of 13.6 billion dlrs.
    Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week
from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade
union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower
coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs
in revenues for 1987.
    Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american
bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of
3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,
which he said was approved.

<TITLE>HUMANA &lt;HUM> DECLARES SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Humana Inc said its board
approved a shareholder rights plan, or so-called poison pill
plan, to ensure its shareholders receive fair treatment in the
event of a proposed takeover.
    Humana said it is now aware of any effort to gain control
of the company.
    Under the plan its board declared a dividend distribution
of one right for each outstanding common share held as of March
16. It said each right entitles holders to purchase a unit of
1/100 of a share of newly authorizes series A participating
preferred at 75 dlrs per unit.
    Humana said the rights become effective after an entity
acquires 20 pct or more of its outstanding common or tenders
for 30 pct of its stock. After such an acquisition, then each
right entitles holders to purchase securities of the company or
an acquiring entity having a market value of twice the right's
exercise price.
    Humana said the rights expire March 4, 1997, unless
redeemed earlier. It said the rights may be redeemed by the
company for one ct per right at any time prior to 10 days
following a public announcement that a 20 pct position has been
acquired.

<TITLE>HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed
Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall
Street analysts said.
    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
it was still interested in the merger.
    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
he is not interested.
    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
target other than to rule out Hughes.
    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of
Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
going.
    "I think the merger is not going through," said Phil Pace,
analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost a
lot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40
pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."
    "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"
said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
    "It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll,
analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak."
Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
period of time.
    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln
dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling
Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be
saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.
    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first
signed "the outlook for the industry has improved materially."
Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry
is lifting.

Armstrong Rubber Co, said it signed agreements with &lt;Condere
Corp> for the sale of its Natchez, Miss. tire plant and its S
and A Truck Tire Sales and Services Corp.
    Terms were not disclosed. Armtek spokesman John Sievers
said S and A is a 50 mln dlr business.
    Earlier this week, Armtek announced the sale of its
industrial tire and assembly business division to Dyneer Corp
of Scotsdale, Ariz.
    Cash proceeds from both sales will be used to reduce
outstanding debt.
     Under a long term supply agreement with Condere, it is
anticipated that truck tires produced at the Natchez plant will
be supplied to the Armstrong Tire Co, an Armtek operating
company, the company said.
    The closing is scheduled to be concluded by March 31, it
said.

<TITLE>FERC ISSUES TAKE-OR-PAY GAS POLICY PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the 
recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas
contracts between producers and pipelines.
    It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment
period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by
Commissioner Charles Stalon.
    FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policy
statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general
policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be
recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."
    FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelines
assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the
commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the
remaining costs through their demand rates."
    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming
existing contracts to help spread the impact of these
take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.
    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposal
represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the
industry through this difficult period of transition to a more
competitive market."
    Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy will
encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay
contractual disputes that have impeded the industry's
transition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to
the industry that we get this problem behind us."

<TITLE>PESCH UNIT SEEKS BALANCE OF REPUBLIC HEALTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alpha Health Systems Corp, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pesch and Co, said it submitted a
merger proposal to the board of REPH Acquisition Co, the parent
company of Republic Health Corp, which is 64 pct owned by Pesch
interests.
    The balance of REPH's common stock is owned by members of
Republic management, McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD>, Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P.
    Republic currently owns 44 hospitals and manages 46 other
facilities, in 25 states.
    Details of the proposal were not disclosed.  Company
representatives were not immediately available.
    The proposal provides that REPH would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Alpha and that the existing REPH common
stockholders would become stockholders of Alpha, it said.
    REPH's board has appointed a special committee to negotiate
terms of the proposed merger, Pesch said.
    Last year, Republic was acquired by REPH in a leveraged
buyout transaction led by Dr. LeRoy Pesch, the principal
shareholder of Pesch and Co.
    Alpha recently submitted a second offer to acquire the
stock of American Medical International Inc (AMI) at 22 dlrs a
share in cash and securities, which is still being considered
by American Medical's board, Pesch said.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Spar Aerospace Ltd>, reporting a
sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and
revenue growth during the next five years.
    "Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its
continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based
communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to
significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five
years," the company said.
    It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased
order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from
223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.
    Spar added that lower development costs in the
communications group and a return to normal operations in gears
and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious
drain on profits" this year.
    It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications
group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new
products and market development, a four-month strike at its
Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from
customers to start work on new programs.

Democrat, said he found a favorable response from key House
Democratic taxwriters to a general idea of raising 18 billion
dlrs in unspecified taxes for the 1988 financial year.
    Wright met with House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois and other Democrats to discuss a plan
broached by the House Budget Committee to spread 36 billion
dlrs deficit reduction through 9 billion dlrs in domestic cuts,
9 billion dlrs in defense spending and the rest in tax hikes.
"They are realists," Wright said of the tax writers after the

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Food and Commercial Workers Union
Local 222 rejected a new contract proposal from Iowa Beef
Processors Inc and remain out of work, union spokesman Allen
Zack said.
    In mid-December, Iowa Beef, a subsidiary of Occidental
Petroleum Corp, closed its beef processing plant at Dakota
City, Nebraska, because it said "it had no alternative to
threats by meatpackers to disrupt operations."
    About 2,800 UFCWU members are affected by what the union
terms as a lockout.  A 3-1/2 year labor contract at the plant
expired December 13.
    Zack said IBP's proposal included elimination of a two-tier
wage structure, a 60 cent an hour wage cut for slaughterers and
a 45 cent an hour wage reduction for processors.
    The new proposal also included a bonus system of 1,000 dlrs
for workers who had been at the plant for two years, Zack said.
The annual turnover rate at the facility is 100 pct, he said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>USG Corp is raising 200 mln dlrs
through an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.77 pct,
said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have an 8-3/4 pct coupon and were priced at
99.784 to yield 120 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct
Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-1 by
Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. A sinking fund starting
in 1998 to retire five pct of the debentures annually can be
increased by 150 pct at the company's option, giving them
estimated average lives of 20.5 or 14.5 years, Salomon said.

joint economic commission as part of efforts to promote
commercial links and industrial cooperation between the two
countries.
    The French Finance Ministry said the commission, to be
composed of businessmen, was agreed during talks between
Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir and Yugoslavian minister
without portfolio Egon Padovan.
    A ministry statement said both sides had agreed on the need
to boost trade links in keeping with an accord signed last year
calling for a 50 pct rise in commercial exchanges between the
two countries over the next six years.
    French trade with Yugoslavia has grown little over the past

purchasers.
    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
other relief.
    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees,
suppliers, creditors, and customers.
    "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
shares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
shareholders against abusive tactics, such as "market
accumulations by Waste Management or others."
    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
common.
    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
prior to their exercise date.
    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
March 20.

<TITLE>GARN FEARS RUN ON SAVINGS AND LOAN DEPOSITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) said a delay
in rescuing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp risked
a run on thrift deposits by nervous customers.
    Garn told a Georgetown University conference on financial
institutions that news reports that the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp was technically in deficit were true and
urged swift congressional action to strengthen the fund.
    Garn said his office received calls from individuals
worried about the safety of their money. "The runs have started,"
Garn, a member of the Banking Committee, said.
    Legislation to infuse more money into the fund which
insures savings deposits was to be voted on today by the
committee but was postponed because of last-minute differences.
    FSLIC has reserves of two billion dlrs but faces potential
claims of 15 billion dlrs, Garn said.
    He said the claims would not come all at once, however, and
dismissed any real danger to deposits at federally insured
thrifts up to the insurance level of 100,000 dlrs.
    "People's money is safe," Garn said, but he added, "We need to
quiet down the situation and put their fear to bed."
    Garn said he and Committee Chairman William Proxmire
(D-Wis) agree on the need for legislation but they differed
over strategy.
    Garn opposes including other issues in the legislation and
would prefer a bill that was limited to restoring FSLIC and
giving regulators more power to cope with failing banks and
thrifts.
    Proxmire's bill also would prohibit new so-called nonbank
banks and thrifts which use a regulatory loophole to operate
outside the usual legal limits on traditional banks.
    William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp, told the conference that if that fund were
combined with FSLIC they could have 29 billion dlrs and cover
contingencies for both the bank and thrift industries.
    However, political differences make a merger of the two
federal funds unlikely, Isaac, now president of the Secura
Group, a consulting firm, said.
    By the 1990's the financial industry will include a handful
of nationwide institutions offering every type of financial
service which evolved from today's banks, nontraditional
financial firms and industrial companies.

    Funaro, who is in Rome today, will fly to Tokyo on Sunday,

France, England, Italy, West Germany and Switzerland.
    Brazil halted payment of interest rates on 68 billion dlrs

<DATELINE>    GREELEY, Colo., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>ConAgra Inc agreed to acquire
Monfort of Colorado Inc in a stock transaction, both companies
said.
    According to the letter of intent signed by the companies,
ConAgra will acquire all of Monfort's 4.3 mln outstanding
shares for 10.75 mln of its own shares.
    Based on ConAgra's closing price of 34 dlrs today, the
transaction is worth about 356.5 mln dlrs. The merger is
expected to be completed in June, they said.
    The companies said the acquisition will result in a
restatement of ConAgra's earnings for the fiscal year ending
May 31, but the restatement is not expected to materially
change the previously reported, or upcoming, fiscal year-end
earnings. In fiscal 1986, ConAgra had net income of 105.3 mln
dlrs on sales of 5.9 billion dlrs.
    For its fiscal year ending August 1986, Monfort reported
25.1 mln dlrs in earnings on sales of 1.6 billion dlrs. The
company is one of the largest lamb and beef producers in the
U.S., producing, transporting and selling the products
domestically and internationally.

<TITLE>HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Key members of the House Agriculture
committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a
pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a
broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,
Congressional sources said.
    The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn
English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support
an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm
(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop
winter and spring wheat.
    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original
proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987
wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the
subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.
    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still
collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed
until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill
and 0/92.
    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program
follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential
farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,
and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.
    Congressional sources said there has not been enough time
to study the implications of a broad 0/92.
    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a
House Agriculture committee member.
    However, several Congressional sources said they expect a
broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House
Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make
spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part
of an overall deficit reduction package.
    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley
(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may
exceed one billion dlrs.
    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the
Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration
estimate it would result in significant budget savings.
    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all
1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5
billion dlrs over five years.
    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the
approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.
    Some officials said it already is late for implementation
of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for
wheat and feedgrains.
    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either
would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.

<TITLE>FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration wants to
encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not
believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.
    "It seems to me that more trade between us is better than
less trade," he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.
    To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign
policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the
Soviet Union to lapse, he said.
    Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining
export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited
items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.
    Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that
comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.
    U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries
that restrict emigration and other rights.
    "What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet
Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends," he said.
    But, he added: "We don't know if they will continue, we
don't know how significant they will be."

<TITLE>PARADYNE &lt;PDN> PLEADS GUILTY TO CRIMINAL CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LARGO, Fla, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paradyne Corp said it pleaded guilty
to criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the Social
Security Administration and agreed to pay 1.2 mln dlrs in fines
and costs to the U.S. Government.
    The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1
mln dlr settlement of class action law suits.
    About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be
provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is
contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it
said.
     The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges
including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to
which Paradyne pleaded guilty.
    The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the
government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil
false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.
    Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for
the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a
derivative lawsuit.
    For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net
loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln
dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to
cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.
    Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and
chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned
as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the
settlement of the indictment.
    Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and
chief operating officer.
    The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,
it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is
optimistic about the outlook for the year.
    For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net
income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.
    Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were
charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal
indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne
in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security
Administration.
    The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government
officials and defaud the Social Security Administration.
Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing
false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation.
 
   Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors
agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other
defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.
    The charges would then be dropped if the defendants
successfully complete the probation period. Details of the
requirements in the agreement were not immediately available.

<AUTHOR>    By Nelson Graves, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>In their search for ways to cut
spending on U.S. farm programs, policymakers and their advisers
here are citing trading in options contracts as an alternative
to federal income and price supports.
    Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that the
government could get out of guaranteeing minimum support prices
if farmers systematically used options contracts to protect
themselves against vacillating market prices.
    "With agricultural options now available, there is less need
for government price support programs to provide price
stability for farmers," the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank, said in a recent position paper.
    "Washington no longer needs to restrict the level and
variability of commodity market prices. Farmers and others in
agribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability by
trading in option markets," the paper, written by Clemson
University professor Kandice Kahl, said.
    Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the
benefits of price support programs without entailing the cost
to taxpayers.
    Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy "put" options in order to
obtain the right to sell at a particular price to the private
seller of the option contract.
    "This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allows
him to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,
by foregoing his option," Kahl said.
    Interest in promoting understanding of options trading
among farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed
change in agricultural policy that would have the effect of
exposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations
in income subsidies.
    The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration and
a cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receive
at least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of how
much they planted.
    Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price
stabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency
payments, equal to the difference between a set target price
and the higher of the support price or market price.
    The so-called decoupling plan, or "0/92", would aim to
curtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement that
farmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.
    Critics of "0/92" plan contend that if the scheme succeeded
in curbing surplus output, market prices would rise and
deficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not to
plant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in the
forefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreage
plantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency payment
with a fixed and gradually declining payment.
    But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea of
offering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.
    Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued by
the notion of having the federal government subsidize the
purchase of "call" options to help farmers hedge their income
risk.
    By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the right
to buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market price
rose above that option price, the farmer could exercise the
option and sell the commodity on the spot market, making up
most of the reduction in the deficiency payment.
    An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offer
legislation linking options and decoupling, but that it might
have to await the results of a pilot project on futures and
options trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.
    The bill required USDA, in association with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in at
least 40 counties which produce major program crops.
    The program, only recently launched, was designed to
encourage producers to participate in futures and options
markets and to ensure that producers' net returns would not
fall below the county loan level for the crops in question.

    The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce

    The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger
plan is midnight tonight.
    Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad and
holds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust while
awaiting federal approval of the merger plan.
    The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one or
the other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision on
the request for reconsideration.
    If the ICC ultimately decides not to reopen the case, it is
expected to reinstate the divestiture order.

<TITLE>BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's recent announcement of a
suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign
debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views
among many international economists and commodities analysts
that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.
    The developing world's most indebted nation is also its
most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as
coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange
revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.
    "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no
way they can trade their way out of this situation," Aldo
Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase
Econometrics, said.
    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the
problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted
world markets, but also had to work to make its position on
foreign exchange markets more profitable.
    "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and
exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange
rates," Roldan said.
    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were
depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a
country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50
pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23
billion dlrs.
    But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and they
have good foreign marketing channels."
    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be
coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign
creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the
market this year with a vengeance.
    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization
(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up
earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing
each other of intransigence.
    "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,
which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.
    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to
preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said
Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others
would suffer.
    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but
as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the
dealer said.
    "If they do come into the market at this level it will go
lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"
he said.
    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents
lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant
deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster
told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has
no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of
the ICO talks on export quotas.
    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the
focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "They
will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"
according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus
difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the
Brazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and
they can't afford to store the crops," he said.
    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time
about large South American crops developing under near ideal
conditions towards record yields.
    "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than
usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.
    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean
Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest
could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.
    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices
are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the
vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.
    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a
reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to
farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.
    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the
soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices
by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can
forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the
loan.
    "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are
starting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. But
he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below
10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.
    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel
Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much
as it can this year because of its economic situation.
    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "The
Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for
storage," he added.
    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil
would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said
it would not make a big difference.
    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be
muted no matter its need to generate capital.
    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which
could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The
country may have oversold and be unable to honor export
commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by
consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will
give it little room to stretch exports, they said.
    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of
surplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it
fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and
find many more markets for it," one analyst said.
    "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would
collapse and they can't afford to do that," she added.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels
per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the
previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter
1986, the International Energy Agency said.
    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production
quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings
were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest
monthly oil market report.
    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to
fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for
fixed volumes over an extended period.

    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota
of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to
Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been
signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required
liftings.
    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on
Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2
mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices
apparently cut February production.
    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the
Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and
0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal
consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.
    The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in
February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and
47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.
    The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd
OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids
(ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other
developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd
with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of
non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal)
and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.
    Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record
1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected
in February in accordance with government curtailments of
approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

<TITLE>ICN &lt;ICN> SUBJECT OF CLASS ACTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two separate class action lawsuits
were filed against ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc and its Viratek Inc
&lt;VIRA> subsidiary, charging the companies with disseminating
allegedly false and misleading information regarding the
company's drug Virazole, which is being tested as a possible
treatment for AIDS.
    The suit, filed in Federal Court here on behalf of ICN
shareholders, charges that disclosures made by ICN over about
the past year encouraged the investing public to believe that
Virazole was a promising drug of major importance and did not
disclose serious adverse side effects, court documents said.
    An ICN spokesman declined comment on the lawsuits.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for
comment.
    Virazole, also known as ribavirin, is undergoing extensive
testing as a possible treatment for AIDS-related illnesses.
    The drug, which is available in a number of countries
outside the United States, has been approved by the FDA for use
domestically in aerosol form as a treatment for an infection
that strikes young children, called respiratory syncytial
virus.
    The FDA and a house subcommittee are conducting their own
separate probes into whether ICN withheld data from the FDA on
adverse reactions to the antiviral drug.
    The Securities and Exchange Commission is also
investigating the company.

<TITLE>ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO FREE REST OF CONTRA AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration issued a
formal statement to Congress designed to free the remaining 40
mln dlrs in 1987 aid for the U.S.-backed "Contra" rebels in
Nicaragua.
    The aid is the last instalment of 100 mln dlrs voted by
Congress for the Contras, and is to be spent on major military
equipment. Congress now has 15 days to disapprove of the 40 mln
dlrs.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We think the
prospects for approval are very good."
    The long-awaited administration move followed by one day
President Reagan's speech to the nation on a report on the
secret Iran arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to the
contras.
    In the House of Representatives earlier today, Rep. David
Bonior, a Michigan Democrat, told reporters Democratic leaders
in the House had decided to push for a 180-day moratorium on
further aid. He said the House would vote next Wednesday.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Holiday Inns Inc, a unit of Holiday
Corp, is raising 1.4 billion dlrs through offerings of notes
and debentures, said bookrunner Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Junk bond traders said they thought this to be the
second-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market. They said
the biggest was BCI Holdings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on
April 10, 1986.
    Via sole manager Drexel, Holiday Inns is selling 900 mln
dlrs of senior notes due 1994 with a 10-1/2 pct coupon and par
pricing. Non-callable for five years, the notes are rated B-1
by Moody's and B-plus by Standard and Poor's.
    Holiday Inns is also offering 500 mln dlrs of subordinated
debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par pricing. The
debentures are non-callable for three years and non-refundable
for five years, Drexel said as lead manager.
    A sinking fund starts in 1997 to retire 60 pct of the
debentures by maturity. This issue is rated B-2 by Moody's and
B-minus by Standard and Poor's. Goldman Sachs co-managed the
debenture deal.

<TITLE>HUNT GROUP HAS COMDATA STAKE, SEEKS INFLUENCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>An investor group led by members of
the Hunt family of Dallas, Texas, told the Securities and
Exchange Commission it has acquired a 6.2 pct stake in Comdata
Network Inc &lt;CDN> and may try to influence company policy.
    The investor group, led by Rosewood Financial Inc, said it
opposes a company recapitalization plan worked out between
Comdata and Mason Best Co, a Texas investment firm, which last
reported holding about 9.5 pct of the company's stock.
    The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire
5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14
dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday.
    Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate,
whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has
notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to buy
between 15 and 25 pct of Comdata's common stock.
    Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of
Comdata's stock until a 15 to 30 day waiting period is over,
unless the FTC gives it early approval.
    Under the proposed Comdata recapitalization plan, the
company would buy up to 10 mln of its common shares at 13.25
dlrs each.
    Mason Best, which belongs to CNI Parnters, a Texas
partnership, would not tender any of its stake under the plan,
but would instead buy another one mln Comdata common shares and
would get representation on the company's board.
    The Hunt group said it has told Comdata that it considers
required payments under the plan, such as a 1.5 mln dlr fee and
the issuance of a warrant to buy 500,000 common shares to be a
waste of the company's assets.
    The Hunt group, which also includes securities Texas firms
Cypress Partners L.P and Driftwood Ltd, said it spent 15.2 mln
dlrs on its 1,197,700 Comdata common shares.

Caputo said.
    Speaking to reporters, Caputo said the near doubling in
trade showed the "tangible and immediate results" of a wide-
ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of
both countries last July.
    He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus
700 mln dlrs in 1985.
    The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two
countries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years.
    Argentine wheat exports to Brazil will increase from
1,375,000 tonnes in 1987 to 2.0 mln tonnes in 1991, the accord
said.

<TITLE>SIA TO APPEAL FED RULING ON COMMERCIAL PAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities Industry Association,
SIA, has asked the U.S. supreme court to overturn a lower-court
ruling that would allow banks to sell commercial paper, SIA
general counsel William Fitzpatrick said.
    In a petition, the SIA said the court of appeals erred in
upholding the decision of the Federal Reserve board of
governors to permit Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT> to
underwrite and distribute commercial paper.
    The SIA charged that the Fed's ruling violates the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act barring banks from underwriting most types
of securities.
    The court of appeals decision, issued last December,
reversed an earlier district court ruling that selling
commercial paper is an improper bank activity and that private
placements by banks is also improper.
    In an earlier round of the case, decided in 1984, the
Supreme Court upheld the SIA's contention that commercial paper
is a security for the purposes of th Glass-Steagall Act.
    The SIA is a trade association representing the interests
of more than 500 U.S. investment banks and securities firms.

<TITLE>TALKS FAIL TO END BRAZILIAN SEAMEN'S STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pay talks aimed at ending a
week-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and the
strike will continue, a union official said.
    The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships
in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of
the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.
    The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have
rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company
Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of
Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).
    Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro
with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without
resolving the dispute.
    He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands,
Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.
    Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to
the government, which has suspended interest payments on part
of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in
the country's trade balance.
    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo
Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike
continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport
Brazilian exports.
    "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment and it is
not conceivable that exports be hit," he told the Gazeta
Mercantil newspaper.

<TITLE>VINER &lt;EAVKF> VIABLE AFTER HECK'S &lt;HEX> MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.A. Viner Holdings Ltd said the earlier
reported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Heck's Inc &lt;HEX>, in
which Viner holds 408,000 shares, would not materially affect
Viner's capital position or its ability to carry on its
profitable brokerage business.
    Viner said its brokerage subsidiary, Edward A. Viner and Co
had regulatory capital of 24.5 mln U.S. dlrs at year-end 1986.
    The company said Heck's Chapter 11 filing could, however,
affect Viner's previously reported legal action to recover
costs from an aborted merger agreement with Heck's.
     It said it and the Toussie-Viner group, with which it made
the merger offer, were assessing their options regarding the
Heck's investment.
    Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000
U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's.
It earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.
    Full-year earnings totaled 2.9 mln dlrs against a
year-earlier loss of 1.5 mln dlrs. The full-year earnings
included a 900,000 dlr net writedown of the Heck's stake, it
said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> SUES USAIR &lt;U> OVER POISON PILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed
suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its
board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill"
anti-takeover plan.
    TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said
TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its
52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way
interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc
&lt;PIE>.
    Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the
enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison
pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more
expensive.
    USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid
was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.
    USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the
matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no
comment on TWA's lawsuit.
    USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the
Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct
of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending
approval of a takeover.
    USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in
order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would
allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that
would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."
    USAir called on the transportation department to reject
TWA's request.

<TITLE>COSTA RICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REFORMING ICO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN JOSE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Costa Rica's economy minister said he
sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee
Organisation system of export quotas.
    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of
the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because
of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-
nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain
and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.
    Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weight
of the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger export
quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.
    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota
system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once
it has satisfied internal demand.
    "There are countries such as our own whose sales
possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current
quotas," Escalante said.
    At the same time, there are countries favoured by the
current system that have been assigned quotas far above their
export potential, he said.
    The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic,"
Escalante said.
    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee
prices over the last week to speculation rather than real
matters of supply and demand.
    "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in the
world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust."

<TITLE>U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. money supply growth is slowing
down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the
Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have
contracted in February.
    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
was justified on account of weakness in the economy.    
    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported
today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary
forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.
The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.
    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.
With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit
accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is
set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.
    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
falling interest rates and banking deregulation.
    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
Economics Inc.
    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all
sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows
at the Fed," McCarthy said.
    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We
have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's
coming in a lot weaker than I thought."    
    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data
prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had
been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct
rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.
    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be
explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
slowdown in the business expansion.
    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.
    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
they were a month ago," he noted.
    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and
rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.
    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct
or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate
enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd
certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."
    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance
sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under
way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line
with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade
deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar
depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to
close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all
that optimistic about the bond market."

    The rise compared to a 1.8 pct rise in January and a 2.5

    The Institute said accumulated overall inflation for the
first two months of this year was 4.0 pct compared to 5.0 pct
for the same period last year.
    Inflation for the 12 months ending February 1987 was 25.5
pct compared to 13.0 pct for the 12 months ending February
1986.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The opposition National Party took a
five percentage point lead over New Zealand's Labour government
in an opinion poll, reversing the seven point lead held by
Labour in a comparable poll in February.
    In the regular Television New Zealand Heylen/Eyewitness
poll, National's support rose to 50 pct against 45 pct a month
earlier while Labour's popularity dropped to 45 pct from 52
pct. National has not been ahead in this poll since April.
    This result contrasts with a newspaper poll published
yesterday that put Labour's popularity at 50 pct and National's
at 44 pct.
    Both polls showed large numbers of voters are uncommitted.
    Approval of the government's handling of the economy also
dropped in the television poll, to 34 pct from 40 pct.
    Prime Minister David Lange remained first choice as Prime
Minister but with 25 pct against 28 pct last month. Opposition
leader Jim Bolger remained steady on nine pct in this category
but his colleague and former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon rose
two points to 18 pct.
    An election is due to be held before September this year.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN FISHMEAL IMPORTS HIGHEST IN 15 YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German gross fishmeal imports rose
60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the
highest level since 1972, trade sources said.
    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net
imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.
    Total West German consumption was estimated at around a
high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The
sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.
    South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West
German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 -
182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.
    The two South American countries' share of the West German
market rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from
Ecuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985.
    West Germany imported 56,823 tonnes of fishmeal in
December, up from 46,236 tonnes in the same 1985 month, with
re-exports at 22,262 tonnes after 25,062 a year earlier.

<TITLE>BRAZIL'S FUNARO WINS FEW PROMISES ON EUROPE TRIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro
last night concluded this week's tour of European capitals
having gleaned little in the way of concrete support from
governments for his country's attempts to find a radical
solution to its debt payments crisis.
    However, banking sources noted the existence of
considerable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its
commercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread belief
that adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems
while patience might pave the way for an eventual
reconciliation.
    Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest
payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks,
followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and
trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions.
    The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration
in Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter
of 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation.
Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week
visited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government
officials and agencies.
    This week they have sought official support in the U.K.,
France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
    They have now decided to extend their tour, flying on
Sunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with a
possible visit to Canada before they return home.
    Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to
government representatives, believing that problems with
Brazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution.
    However, banking sources noted that their attempts to
enlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been
met almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks.
    This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for
Brazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme,
with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also
recommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly.

<TITLE>RAPID-AMERICAN CORP UNIT PURSUES FRAUD SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Rapid-American Corp> said its Faberge
Inc subsidiary was granted approval by federal court to pursue
its 11 mln dlr fraud suit against &lt;Porterfield Buying Unit> and
its partners.
    Faberge said the U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York, reinstituted the suit against Porterfield and its
partners Samuel Wyman and Grace Porterfield, vacating an
earlier court decision dismissing the suit.
    The suit, filed in 1982, charges Porterfield with
overcharging commissions and for billing commericals that were
promised but never aired, according to the company. Faberge
alleges that Porterfield used fraudulent invoices and schemes
which netted it more than 3,500,000 dlrs in illegal profits.
    The suit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), was dismissed earlier because
the court ruled it did not meet certain criteria of the RICO
Act. But an Appeals Court sent the suit back to district court
based on two related decisions involving the RICO Act, Faberge
said.

<TITLE>U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Officials are studying the possible
link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the
spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a
Ministry of Agriculture official said.
    A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of
salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had
been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote
the growth of cattle.
   The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the
Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to
investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of
salmonella.
    "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible
effects on human and animal health," the official said. The
government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm
Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves
under 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would
help reduce the spread of salmonella.

<TITLE>DOME&lt;DMP> REPEATS DOME MINES&lt;DM> STAKE FOR SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake of
gold producer Dome Mines Ltd continues to be for sale "at the
right price," spokesman David Annesley said in response to an
inquiry.
    Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard
Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its
stake in Dome Mines.
    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy
Corp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment for
Dome, and we have no intention of selling it."
    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.
    He also declined to specify at what price the company would
consider selling it shares.
    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
Dome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.
    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. A
price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly
attractive," Annesley said.
    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome
Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an
opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
virtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.
    Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure
debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56
major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.
    The company previously said it expects to detail the plan
to lenders early next week.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> PROPOSES NEW SIMPLIFIED REGULATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co
said it is proposing a new simplified approach to regulating
the long-distance telecommunications market.
    In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, ATT
proposed replacing the current rate of return regulation with
simplified rules that "would eliminate many costs now imposed on
customers while freeing ATT to introduce new services and
pricing options more swiftly."
    The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp said
the firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principal
long-distance competitor, ATT.
    Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would commit
to continue providing basic long-distance services to all
customers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in all
parts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to do
otherwise.
    Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the company
to file tariffs for new interstate services and price changes
that would go into effect within 14 days.
    In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of the
voluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time it
introduces or changes long-distance services.
    The new proposal would place the burden on challengers to
demonstrate that ATT's tariffs "are unreasonable".
    It would also require long-distance companies to submit
periodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in the
industry.
    Lawrence Garfinkel, ATT's Vice-President of Marketing
Services, said, "With this filing, we're suggesting that
regulators replace a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a
more finely tuned, targeted approach."

eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid
money market liquidity, covering the period March 9 to 20.
    The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between
0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current
4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday.
    Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11
to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.
    They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to
6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the
Bank for the previous seven-day facility.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's director-general of
finance Chris Stals said he was optimistic about reaching a
mutually acceptable agreement with foreign bank creditors in
debt renegotiation talks scheduled to begin next month.
    Stals, the country's chief foreign debt negotiator, said "we
are busy finding out how they (banks) feel. They all have
different opinions. There is no consensus."
    But asked if he was optimistic on agreement for a new debt
repayment plan, Stals replied "yes" in a telephone interview from
his Pretoria office.
    He declined to comment further before the major review of
the interim debt agreement regarding the moratorium on
principal repayments on 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's 24
billion dlr external debt.
    The agreement on the moratorium with some 330 creditor
banks expires on June 30. "We have had a series of discussions
with a great number of banks both bilaterally and individually
on the foreign debt situation in preparation for April," Stals
said.
    He said no date has been set for the meeting and declined
to comment on published reports in the past few months that
banks may demand accelerated repayments.
    Banking sources here said only an escalation of South
African political unrest would increase foreign pressure on
repayments.
    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said last month that in
the forthcoming talks South Africa would give a fair deal to
all creditors but not agree to "unrealistic demands."

subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers
and upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cts a bushel set
earlier this year.
    The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985
by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U.S.
subsidies were driving American corn prices below Canadian
production costs.
    A spokesman for the Department of Revenue said a study of
the level of the duty will be undertaken in the next six months
to determine if it should be adjusted.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Kathleen Hays</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Momentum in th U.S. economy may be
picking up given solid across-the board increases in the
February U.S. employment report, economists said.
    U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,
twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a
319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously
reported 448,000 increase.
    "Even if you look at January and February together, this is
still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in
the market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.
    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much
larger gains in February U.S. production and income than
previously forecast.
    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from
34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose
0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since
November 1966, the Commerce Department said.
    "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very
large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7
pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4
pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour
in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.
    "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means
we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis
the wage and salary disbursement," he said.
    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should
rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.
    He said the February employment gains are consistent with
his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product
growth forecast of 3.7 pct.
    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But
most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.
    "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  
  "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he
said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,
but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."
    "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable
goods were weak in January and now employment is strong."
    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,
followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.
retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap
widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.
    "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman
Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending,
goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first
quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.
    "The employment and production data point to a big
inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth
quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."
    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000
in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was
accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
industries returning to work.
    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains
have resulted from an improving trade outlook.
    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.
trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve
in the first quarter.
    "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,
but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show
that trade is improving," Benderley said.
    "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some
reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter
GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."
    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment
rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in
January, previously reported at 166,000.
    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But
this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down
from a previously reported 142,000 gain.
    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at
6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since
March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.
    "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"
Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,
but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS G-6 PACT JUST A START</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is
only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic
cooperation among leading countries.
    In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker
said "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and
culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start."
    He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which
we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote
more balanced international growth."
    The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to
strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget
deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their
currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic
fundamentals.
    Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure for
protectionist trade legislation "and this pressure for
protectionism is coming from new areas of society."
    But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that
supported free trade.

<TITLE>TORONTO DOMINION TO BUY SEAT ON STOCK EXCHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> said it agreed
to acquire a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange, becoming the
first Canadian bank to do so after government proposals to
allow banks full involvement in the securities industry.
    The bank, Canada's fifth largest, said one of its
subsidiaries was already a member of the Toronto Futures
Exchange and that this further step showed the bank's
commitment to active involvement in the securities industry.
    Toronto Dominion established a discount brokerage service
in 1984 called Green Line Investors Service that now serves
more investors than any other discount broker in Canada.
    The bank previously said in January that it preferred to
establish its own securities unit rather than acquire an
existing investment dealer.
    "Full TSE access will enable us to provide an even higher
level of customer service and maintain Green Line's position as
an industry leader," said Toronto Dominion president Robert
Korthals in a statement.
    He told reporters at a news conference that the bank agreed
to purchase the seat for 195,000 dlrs from Hector M. Chisholm
and Co.
    The price represents a recent high from the 166,000 dlrs
paid for a seat in 1981, but the record price remains 200,000
dlrs paid in 1929.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's director-general of
finance Chris Stals said he was optimistic about reaching a
mutually acceptable agreement with foreign bank creditors in
debt renegotiation talks scheduled to begin next month.
    Stals, the country's chief foreign debt negotiator, said "we
are busy finding out how they (banks) feel. They all have
different opinions. There is no consensus."
    But asked if he was optimistic on agreement for a new debt
repayment plan, Stals replied "yes" in a telephone interview from
his Pretoria office.
    The agreement on the moratorium with some 330 creditor
banks expires on June 30. "We have had a series of discussions
with a great number of banks both bilaterally and individually
on the foreign debt situation in preparation for April," Stals
said.
    He said no date has been set for the meeting and declined
to comment on published reports in the past few months that
banks may demand accelerated repayments.
    Banking sources here said only an escalation of South
African political unrest would increase foreign pressure on
repayments.
    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said last month that in
the forthcoming talks, South Africa would give a fair deal to
all creditors but not agree to "unrealistic demands."

<TITLE>BAKER SEES BRAZIL/BANKS REACHING AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said he believes Brazil will strike an agreement with its
private creditors.
    Answering questions from the National Newspaper
Association, Baker said "Brazil is not defaulting on its debt,"
and pointed out its interest payments moratorium was called
because of dwindling foreign reserves.
    He said that based on discussions with Brazilian officials
here last week, he believed Brazil's approach to its problems
was "nonconfrontational," adding, "We fully expect Brazil will
work this out with its private creditors."
    Baker pointed out Brazil was paying in full and on time its
debts to multilateral institutions, the U.S. government and
other western creditor governments.
    The country has declared an interest payments moratorium on
68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt and frozen
some 15 billion dlrs in trade and interbank deposits by
commercial bank creditors at Brazilian institutions.

<TITLE>BAKER DENIES CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY ON DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
there has been no change in U.S. policy on the value of the
dollar.
    Baker, when asked if the policy was changed in view of
comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who
said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the
dollar by 10 to 15 pct, replied, "No."
    Yesterday Robert Ortner, Undersecretary of Commerce for
Economic Affairs, said he thought the yen was undervalued but
said that was his personal view.
    This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to
conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States
and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at
about the right level to reflect underlying economic
conditions.
    Baker, who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper
Association, declined to elaborate on his statement about U.S.
policy.

<TITLE>SOME SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS REMAIN ON RHINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Limited shipping restrictions due to high
water remain in force on parts of the West German stretch of
the Rhine river between the Dutch border and the city of Mainz
but most are expected to be lifted this weekend.
    water authority officials said The restrictions, caused by
high water levels, include speed limits and directives to keep
to the middle of the river to prevent damage to the river
banks. The high water was expected to recede within two days to
below levels at which the restrictions come into force.
    Traffic was halted briefly late Tuesday night, Wednesday
and parts of Thursday on stretches of the Rhine between Bonn
and Koblenz but the shipping bans were lifted, the officials
said. Shipping is now permitted on all parts of the West German
section of the Rhine, with restrictions in some areas.

<DATELINE>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Narragansett Capital Inc &lt;NARR>
said it and Dudley S. Taft have requested a response from Taft
Broadcasting Co by March 12.
    Earlier today, Taft Broadcasting said Taft, the company's
vice chairman, and Narragansett had offered 145 dlrs for each
of Taft's 9.2 mln outstanding shares.
    The company said the offer is conditioned on approval of
its board, but a spokesman declined comment on whether or not
the board has scheduled a meeting.
     The Narragansett/Taft group will provide the equity portion
of the offer by contributing at least 125 mln dlrs in cash and
Taft Broadcasting common, Narragansett said.
    It said the group has been advised by First Boston Inc's
&lt;FBC> First Boston Corp that the investment banker is "highly
confident that financing for the acquisition can be
consummated."
    Narragansett said the offer is subject to negotiation of a
definitive merger agreement and definitive financing agreements
as well as approval by regulators, Taft's board and Taft's
stockholders.
    The Narragansett/Taft group said its letter to Taft's board
states the group intends to return control over a significant
portion of the company's equity to the Taft family while
providing other stockholders with a means of realizing a very
attractive value for their shares.

to reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of the

    The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce
competition.
    Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of
pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would
preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged
railroad and the public.
    If the commission agrees that public benefits and
competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the
merger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file
statements in response to the supplemental petition.

<TITLE>NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group
said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief
executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
    The statement said the sale did not represent any
withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
shareholders.
    Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
    Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
    Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
    Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner
&lt;Industrivarden AB>.
    The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
company was in a much worse state than he thought.

    The utility's BBB-minus preferred stock was affirmed. The
company has one billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    S and P cited continuing improvement in earnings protection
measures because of a 1986 emergency rate increase.
    While various writeoffs related to the abandoned Marble
Hill nuclear facility have weakened common equity, the
retention of all common earnings until at least 1989 will help
restore capital structure balance fairly quickly, S/P said.

<TITLE>GERMAN SECURITIES PURCHASES SET RECORD IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Purchases of West German bonds in
January reached a record 13 billion marks' worth as a result of
investment from other European countries amid expectations of a
European Monetary System realignment, the Bundesbank said.
    This produced a surplus in the securities item of the
long-term capital account of 11.17 billion marks and was the
primary contributor to a 10.15 billion surplus in the total
capital account, turning round December's 6.48 billion deficit.
    In January last year, the capital account, combining long
and short-term flows, showed a surplus of 2.27 billion marks,
the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank said foreign purchase of German shares in
January was, by contrast to the massive bond investments, only
about 200 mln marks worth, while overseas purchases of
"Schuldschein" promissory notes fell by 500 mln from December.
    The long-term account in total showed a surplus of 11.17
billion marks, reversing the 2.60 billion deficit in December
and up from a surplus of 9.37 billion in January, 1986.
    Among other items, direct domestic investment abroad posted
an outflow of 2.86 billion marks after a deficit of 4.98
billion in December and a surplus of 1.13 billion in January
last year.
    The Bundesbank confirmed earlier figures from the federal
statistics office that the current account surplus in January
fell to 4.86 billion marks from 8.47 billion last year.
    The trade surplus in the month was down to 7.20 billion
from 11.57 billion in December.
    In the invisibles account, the surplus on services was 100
mln marks, turning round a deficit of 500 mln marks in
December. The balance on payments transfers narrowed to a
deficit of 2.40 billion marks from 2.70 billion.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said debt
ratings on 840 mln dlrs of debt of Baker International Corp and
Hughes Tool Co remain on creditwatch.
    S and P cited the adjournment of a special shareholder
meeting in which Hughes objected to certain conditions for the
merger of the companies set by the U.S. Justice Department.
    If the merger is consumated, S and P would rate the newly
formed Baker Hughes Inc senior debt at A-minus, subordinated
debt at BBB-plus and commercial paper at A-2. But if the merger
does not occur, Baker's senior debt would be cut to A-minus
from A and commercial paper to A-2 from A-1.
    Without the merger, Hughes Tool's current ratings of B-plus
for senior debt, B-minus for subordinated debt and C for
commercial paper would be affirmed, S and P said.
    That would reflect the continuation of dismal industry
conditions and the company's substantially weaker credit
profile, S and P explained.

said it and police authorities are investigating a possible
embezzlement by a bonded former employee that may involve
several hundred thousand dollars.
    The company said it does not expect the possible
embezzlement to materially affect 1986 earnings. It said the
release of results will be delayed for about a week by the

the money.

<TITLE>GENENTECH &lt;GENE> FILES SUIT AGAINST FDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Genentech Inc said it filed
a suit against the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia over an unresolved
issue relating to genetically engineered human growth hormone.
    At issue, said Genentech, is whether Eli Lilly and Co's
&lt;ELI> recombinant human growth hormone and its new recombinant
growth hormone, are the same drug. Both drugs are under review
by the FDA.
    Since 1985, Genentech has been marketing Protropin, a
recombinant human growth hormone for treating abnormally short
children.
    The biotechnology concern said it has the right to seven
years of exclusive marketing for Protropin, granted orphan drug
status by the FDA. Orphan drugs are a special category of drugs
that are used to treat rare diseases.
    Genentech said the suit seeks clarification of what
constitutes a drug under the standards of the orphan Drug Act.
It suggested that without the "clarification," companies that
develop orphan drugs may not recover development costs during
the period of marketing exclusivity.
    It said Lilly's growth hormone and its new growth hormone
differ slightly, and are produced by different processes.

of the state's rights to a 2.5 billion franc one-for-five

    The price was based on a 12 billion franc minimum value set
on Rhone-Poulenc by the independent Privatisation Committee

privatisation programme, the Ministry said.
    A Ministry statement said eight mln privileged investment
certificates, a form of non-voting preference share, would be
issued, equivalent to one certificate for every five existing
shares.
    It said 10 pct of the certificates would be reserved for
Rhone-Poulenc employees at a preferential price, and 1.5 mln
certificates would be placed on the U.S. Market by a public
offering.
    About four mln certificates, the remainder of the state's
rights entitlement to the issue, would be offered on the Paris
Bourse on the basis of 20 francs per lot of five rights and 315
francs per new certificate, making a total 335 francs, it said.
    Rhone-Poulenc is 88.39 pct state-owned.

barge traffic up to the Twin Cities in Minnesota after repairs
were completed and the first barges moved upstream through Lock
and Dam 20 near Quincy, Ill at 0600 CST today, an Army Corps of
Engineers spokesman said.
    About 14 to 15 inches of ice were reported between locks
three and four on the upper Mississippi River, but other
sections were generally free of ice, the spokesman said.
    Midwestern weather has been so mild that barges probably
could have kept loading at Mid-Mississippi River terminals
through the winter, if Lock and Dam 20 had not been scheduled
for repairs, he said.
    The Peoria and La Grange locks on the Illinois River are
still scheduled to close July 13, for two months of repairs.

the product of 1.8 times LIBOR from 21.975.
    The Residential CMO package also has three fixed-rate

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Duff and Phelps said it has downgraded
fixed income securities of USX Corp and its subsidiaries and at
the same time took the issues off its watch list.
    The change affects about 6.6 billion dlrs in debt
securities.
    USX senior debt was lowered to DP-11 (high BB) from DP-9
middle BBB), Marathon oil senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9,
United States Steel senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9 and
subordinated debt to DP-13 (low BB) from DP-11, USX preferred
stock to DP-14 (high B) from DP-12 (middle BB) and preference
stock to DP-15 (middle B) from DP-13.
    The downgrades reflect substantial business risk and
increased financial risk, Duff and Phelps said.
    The steel industry remains intensely competitive and major
domestic integrated producers have lost share to imports and
minimills, D and P said. In oil and gas, profitability and cash
flows are larger, but there is still considerable volatility.
As for financial risk, USX has arranged to borrow 1 billion
dlrs through a production payment of its Marathon subsidiary.
Consequently a selected group of creditors has prior claim to
public debt holders for cash flows from this asset, D and P
said.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador today suspended its crude oil
exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that
damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy
and Mines MInistry statement said.
    It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera
Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was
declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor.
    Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day
(bpd).
    A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping
station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged.
    He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached
to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed.
    The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador
volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean
seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international
Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the
volcano, he said.
    The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia,
according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.

downgraded 50 mln dlrs of debt of Allied Bancshares Inc and the
lead bank, Allied Bank of Texas.
    Cut were the parent's senior debt to Ba-3 from Baa-2 and
commercial paper to Not Prime from Prime-2. The lead bank's
long-term deposits were reduced to Ba-1 from Baa-2 and
short-term deposits were cut to Not Prime from Prime-2.

on Allied's asset quality and profitability. The rating agency
expects nonperforming loans to remain high by industry
standards because of exposure to energy and real estate.

<DATELINE>    COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co>
said its property-casualty companies had a net loss of 56 mln
dlrs last year while its life insurance operations earned 66.8
mln dlrs.
    Nationwide said its property-casualty group, the
fourth-largest U.S. property-casualty insurer had a 106 mln dlr
loss in 1986. Nationwide Life Insurance Co earned 62.8 mln dlrs
in 1985, with last year's profit including record capital gains
of 14.4 mln dlrs, up from gains of 2.6 mln dlrs the previous
year.
    The company said its property-casualty group had a record
loss from insurance operations last year of 859 mln dlrs after
policyholders' dividends, up 25 pct from 1985's 710 mln dlrs.
    Nationwide said a surge in claims from personal auto
insurance and the volatile commercial liability coverages
during a period of unprecedented sales growth generated the
loss.
    The company said over 576 mln dlrs of last year's group
losses came from commercial insurance lines and 282 mln dlrs
from its personal auto insurance business.
    Partially offsetting 1986's record insurance losses,
Nationwide said, were record investment gains of 775 mln dlrs
and a 28 mln dlr federal tax credit. The investment gains were
up 39 pct from 1985's gains of 559 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pierre Suchet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French primary bond market is showing
signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
week, dealers noted.
    The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the
money markets since December has been based on a floor and
ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
seven day repurchase rates.
    For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate
cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
absorbed.
    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
focussed on the likely three next issues.
    These will include an expected four to five billion franc
issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
Refinancement Hypothecaire.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reuters Holdings PLC's Reuters
Information Services Inc subsidiary and Real Estate Financing
Partnership of Philadelphia said they have developed RSVP, an
electronic market access system for commercial property
financing.
    The companies said the system, on completion of testing,
will use the Reuter communications network to provide a
confidential method for the purchasing, selling and financing
of commercial property. They said principal participants in
RSVP are expected to be private and institutional commercial
real estate owners, brokers, purchasers and investors.
    The companies said the system, which will operate in
domestic and international markets, is expected to be
particularly useful to mortgage brokers and loan
correspondents.
    They said Reuters will provide systems software, hardware
and telecommunications capabilities and support under a
long-term working agreement with Real Estate Financing
Partnership and will also provide sales assistance and
marketing support to Real Estate Financing.
    Real Estate Financing designed RSVP.
    The companies said RSVP will use Reuter Monitor technology
and the Reuter private communications network to provide a
global financing capability for commercial real estate
ventures. It will enable parties seeking real estate financing
to identify funding sources on a private basis.
    They said the system is scheduled for testing in August in
selected U.S. cities and is expected to be operational about 90
days after initial testing.

<TITLE>IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian government, which
introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,
has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is
scope for further cuts in 1988.
    The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions
of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic
policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the
weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.
    The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest
rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.
    The team's report to the government praises last year's
spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending
by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy
perform "better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in
the 1980s."
    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation
of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much
lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the
government has set itself for 1989.
    The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of
GNP in 1986.
    The report says "The most that can be afforded over the next
few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of
general Government."
    It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax
system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax
burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the
debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.
    "Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure
growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,
we feel that your position would be stronger if you could
decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988," the
report adds.
    The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the
government's determination to keep its currency strong and to
curb inflation.
    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net
long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.
    It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and
an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the
subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in
Belgian francs.

unit of NEC Corp &lt;NIPNY> said a U.S. District Court judge
denied NEC's motion to disqualify Judge William Ingram from
presiding over its lawsuit against Intel Corp &lt;INTC>.
    NEC said it sought to disqualify the judge when it learned
in October 1986 that Ingram had an ownership interest in an
investment club that owned Intel stock.
    Ingram reported that his interest in Intel through the club
amounted to about 80 dlrs worth of Intel's stock and the judge
ended his participation in the investment club after NEC moved
to have him disqualified, an NEC spokeswoman said.
    NEC said it intends to appeal the ruling.
    NEC sued Intel in December 1984 seeking a judgement
declaring that microcode, or the control function, in certain
NEC microprocessor products does not infringe on any valid
Intel copyrights.
    Intel subsequently filed a suit charging NEC with
infringing on Intel semiconductor copyrights.

<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>This week's Bank of England resistance to
strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
said.
    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action
over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
distance of that range," he said.
    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
broad target range around this area.
    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
    "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive
director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
foreign exchange market.
    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
holds around these levels.
    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they
ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.
    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being
invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
notice.
    However, the authorities will hope that at least a
proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
    "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey,
economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
sterling, at least in the near term.
    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
about March 17, Budget Day.
    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
Budget, said Temperton.
    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
    "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
equities arm of Mercury International Group.
    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is "very disappointed" by a Canadian government
finding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.
    "This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing
U.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of
multilateral trade negotiations," Lyng said in a statement.
    The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to
apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.
    Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are
not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding
that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.
    "Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that
Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising
faster than consumption," Lyng said.

<TITLE>GATT STUDYING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES CEILING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world trade body GATT said its
negotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for a
ceiling on agricultural subsidies.
    GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq told
reporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as the
participants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on the
table.
    He said the ceilings under discussion would only be applied
to those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
with high subsidy spending.
    Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development showed that its 24 member western
industrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by a
total average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from
1979-81.
    Within that total, the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs, Japan 24
billion, and the European Community 57 billion dlrs.
    Yves Berthelot, an official for the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, said the suppression of
agricultural subsidies in temperate countries, which would
allow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domestic
prices, would be difficult but inevitable.

<TITLE>OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> OFFICIALS HAWKING STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Outboard Marine Corp's top executives
are making sales presentations to portfolio managers and
analysts ahead of a planned two mln share offering expected
soon, company officials said.
    Chairman Charles Strang and Wayne Jones, vice president for
strategic planning, are meeting with portfolio managers in New
York and Boston to line up interest for the offering
underwritten solely by Morgan Stanley, the officials said.
    Outboard Marine has been the subject of recurring takeover
rumors, with one rumor this week naming Sun Chemical as the
potential suitor for 40 dlrs a share.
    Sun Chemical is said to have 4.9 pct of Outboard and is
conducting a study on whether to bid for control of the marine
engine and boatbuilding company. A Sun Chemical spokesman
declined to comment.
    Stanley Fishman, analyst at Fahnestock and Co, said it is
better for a suitor to bid for Outboard before the two mln
shares are sold. Outboard now has 17 mln shares outstanding.
    "Even though Outboard would use proceeds from the share
offering to pay down debt, and there would be less debt the
acquiring company would assume, it still means more shares the
suitor must buy to acquire the company," he said.
    Fishman, who has heard the Sun Chemical rumor, said a 40
dlrs a share would just open the bidding.
    Outboard Marine today was trading at 33-5/8, down 5/8.
    "There are only two companies that count in the marine
leisure business, Brunswick Corp &lt;BC> being the first. But you
can't play down number two," He said. "It's a growing field.
There's a lot of leisure money out there. I think 40 would be a
minimum price. It will be higher."
    A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the offering has been
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission but a
kick-off date and price have not been set.

<TITLE>BANKERS PREDICT SHAKEOUT IN SWEDISH BANKING SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The central bank recommended a major
change in the traditional ownership structure of Swedish
commercial banks that bankers said would inevitably lead to the
takeover of remaining small regional banks.
    The recommendation was prompted by a recent proposal by the
&lt;Proventus> financial group to create a new holding company
that will control the third-largest commercial bank &lt;Gotabanken
and Wermlandsbanken>, a small regional bank.
    The central bank gave its approval and said financial
groups should be allowed to have banking subsidiaries as long
as the groups did not include industrial or trading companies.
    The central bank was commenting on a proposed new bill
governing Swedish financial groups.
    It recommended that insurance companies should not be
allowed to own banks until a separate inquiry into the problem
was completed. Sweden's two biggest insurance companies have
both said they would like to enter the banking business.
    Sweden's commercial banks on the other hand have long
wanted to buy up insurance companies.
    Bankers said the recommendations would mainly bring the
rules up to date with new circumstances created by the
extensive de-regulation of the Swedish financial markets since
1982.
    Bankers said it was clear that others would follow the
Proventus example and that this would lead to a shake-up in the
banking system with the remaining small regional banks being
absorbed by larger banking groups.
    The central bank also recommended banks be allowed to
operate their stockbroking departments as subsidiaries, which
bankers said would lead to banks taking over small stockbroking
firms. Banks have long complained the ban on splitting off the
broking departments forced them to operate at a disadvantage
because they could not match the partnerships and large
salaries stockbrokers could offer their staff.

Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).
    In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG
stated its "strong support" for an eep offer to Moscow.
    "We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet
EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet
purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to
purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced," NAWG said.
    "Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S.
eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure
mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain
agreement," the letter said.

<TITLE>ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS>
chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase
in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was
encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.
    Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release
of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign
earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,
notably in the securities business.
    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10
share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.
    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share
price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.
    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the
future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and
ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.
    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986
by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1
pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.
    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings
margins via traditional lending activities, he said.
    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk
provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly
concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor
which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank
stocks recently.
    He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially
troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin
American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.
    He added that losses incurred through loans to tin
producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had
been written off.

<TITLE>ROCHESTER GAS &lt;RGS> SEES FURTHER NUCLEAR DELAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rochester Gas and Electric Co
said it now estimates Unit Two of the Nine Mile nuclear power
plant will not start commercial operation until 1988's first
quarter.
    The utility said this estimate is based on the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's advisory to the plant's operator,
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp &lt;NMK>, a more through demonstration
of the main steam isolation valve's acceptablility will be
needed before the plant's power ascension program can proceed.
    Rochester Gas disclosed the further delay in the operation
of Nine Mile Unit Two in the preliminary prospectus describing
its proposed offering of 300,000 preferred shares, par value
100 dlrs.
    A spokesman said Niagara Mohawk had been projecting
commercial operation of the plant in September, adding this
projection was scheduled for review upon completion of the main
steam isolation valve testing program which company officials
still expect next week.
    In the past, Niagara Mohawk has put the cost of delays in
Nine Mile Unit Two at two mln dlrs per day.
    Niagara Mohawk has a 41 pct interest in the nuclear power
plant, while Rochester Gas owns 14 pct.
    In a statement released today, Rochester Gas said the NRC,
based on progress of the valve testing program, had advised
Niagra Mohawk a more through demonstration of the acceptability
of the valve's and their ability to meet regulations and
technical specifications will be required before the power
ascension program can proceed.
    The Niagara Mohawk spokesman said the utility would have
not immediate response to the Rochester Gas statement.

<TITLE>FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AID TO JOBLESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government plans to go ahead with a
three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed,
with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to
everyone becoming redundant, government officials said.
    At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln
jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive
unemployment benefit.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television
interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in
a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the
right to social benefits."
    The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment
through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5
billion franc government fund set up last month to finance
spending on special areas of concern.
    Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers
hit by European Community cost-cutting measures.
    French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8
mln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in
1981.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration continues
to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union, but would need assurances from the Soviets that they
would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a
senior U.S. Agriculture Department official said.
    "I think it still is under active debate whether or not it
would be advisable" to make an the export enhancement offer to
the Soviets, Thomas Kay, administrator of the department's
Foreign Agriculture Service, told Reuters.
    "We'd need some assurances from them (the Soviets) that they
would buy if offered" the wheat under the subsidy plan, he said.
Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent "premature."
    The Reagan administration's cabinet-level Economic Policy
Council is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters,
agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, administration officials
said earlier.

<TITLE>CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED - YEUTTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. corn
imports injure Canadian farmers is "totally unjustified."
    "U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is
inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any
reasonable measure," Yeutter said in a statement.
    He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it could
result in "a rash of protectionist actions throughout the
world." French corn growers have recently indicated they will
challenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.
    Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision
closely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on
facts, "will carefully evaluate appropriate responses." Yeutter
did not say what steps the U.S. may take in response.

lead-manager Lazard Freres et Cie said.
    The issue will be priced at par with a one pct coupon, and
each 10,000 franc bond will carry 18 warrants, each giving the
right to subscribe to Moet-Hennessy shares over a three-year
period at 2,720 francs each. The high equity content of the
issue accounts for the low coupon.
    Moet-Hennessy shares closed on the Paris Bourse today at
2,678 francs, up 38 from yesterday's close.
    The issue is being co-lead managed by Credit Lyonnais,
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Credit Suisse First Boston.

<TITLE>S/P SAYS CORPORATE DOWNGRADES MAY EASE THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
expects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this year
from the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985.
    However, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stay
at about the same level as in the past few years.
    The narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgrades
would reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatile
energy markets and slow but steady economic growth, S and P
said.
    In particular, S and P expects that the industrial and
banking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986.
    S and P noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades were
concentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negative
factor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers and
acquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers.
    It said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year.
    While S and P noted that the energy markets have stabilized
after last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would not
mark a turnaround for this industry.
    In addition, S and P does not expect any big shocks to hit
the junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of
1986's unexpected LTV Corp &lt;LTV> bankruptcy filing.
    Utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall
1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. But
like last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and P
said.
    The rating agency said that downgrades would continue to
outpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987's
rating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio
of downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted.
    S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industry
would remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. A
detailed report will appear in the March 9 S/P Creditweek.

<TITLE>CONTRA LEADER LINKS MYSTERY DLRS TO ARMS SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero
has for the first time linked payments received for his forces
to a dummy company controlled by former White House aide Oliver
North, legal sources said.
    The company, Lake Resources Inc, was established by North
and his ally, retired Air Force major General Richard Secord,
and had a Swiss bank account into which proceeds from secret
arms sales to Iran were deposited.
    Calero yesterday made public bank statements showing his
group has received 32 mln dlrs since mid-1984, but said he has
no idea who donated the money.
    Calero, head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, known by
its Spanish initials as FDN, provided the same records to a
grand jury investigating the Iran arms scandal that has shaken
the Reagan administration.
    The bank statements he showed reporters ended with March,
1985, so they shed no light on whether Iran arms profits were
diverted to contra rebels since shipments of U.S. arms to Iran
did not begin until September 1985.
    But last night, Calero told Cable News Network that he had
just discovered deposits made in late October, 1985 by Lake
Resources into a contra account in the Cayman Islands.
   
    This came at a time when proceeds from the Iran arms sales
were being funneled to the Swiss bank account.
    "I just found out," he said.
    Legal sources confirmed that Calero had turned over the
newly disclosed information, which was brought to his attention
after one of his lawyers noticed the two desposits made by Lake
Resources buried in the mass of bank records.
    They said that Calero has promised to review in more detail
the bank statements and pass along any further information on
possible deposits by the North-Secord groups.
    The Tower commission said in its report that up to 19.8 mln
dlrs from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran was unaccounted for
and may have been diverted to the contras.
    Calero's FDN is the largest of the contra rebel groups
that are fighting to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista
government of Nicaragua.
    On the advice of his lawyer, Calero declined to go into
details about what he told the grand jury.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>India has called a fresh buying tender
for up to four 13,000 tonne cargoes of white sugar on March 11,
traders here said.
    The tender calls for one cargo of prompt sugar and two to
three with March/April shipment sugar, or the same as the eight
cargoes bought at a tender two days ago. That tender originally
only sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale of
eight. India also granted the sellers options to sell twice
that amount at the same price but for April/May shipment.
    Depending on prices, traders said it would be likely for
India again to buy more than the tonnage formally sought.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Pioneer Group Inc said its 70
pct-owned Teberebie Goldfields Ltd venture has been granted an
additional concession of land in Ghana to look for and mine
gold.
    The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an
additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,
contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier, the
company said.
    The original concession appears to have a substantial
amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or
6/100 ounces, of gold per metric ton.
    But the venture has no firm estimates on the costs of
extracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the
reserves can be mined profitably, the company said.
    It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted tests on the
newly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in
geological characteristics to the original land.

<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world's major copper producing and
consuming countries have reached "a degree of consensus" on
objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at
reviewing the world copper market, officials said.
    Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed
forum for copper have recommended that another session be held
in September to consider further the nature of such a group, a
spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) said.
    The one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to
examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
stabilise depressed world prices.
    Its objectives would include increasing market
transparency, through improved statistics, and undertaking
activities aimed at developing the copper market and
contributing to improvement of demand.
    UNCTAD's spokesman said, "Once they have agreed on detailed
functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to
setting up the body."

<TITLE>CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
    "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
to major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices
50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
barrel.
    "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
under question," McKinley said.
    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
the first quarter of this year.
    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
to offer discounts to the official price.
    "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"
the general trading manager of an international oil company
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
    "This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
it to be there," McKinley said.
    International oil traders said that other short-haul
crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
managers at several companies told Reuters.
    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
Management, said OPEC production was lower "because of the
Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."
     He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.
    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
    "There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
being resold," one international trader said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/ PAPER STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Patrick Rizzo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The attempt by International Paper Co
&lt;IP> and Stone Container Co &lt;STO> to raise linerboard prices
could stick, industry analysts said, citing strong demand and
tight capacity. But they said rising inventories hurt the odds.
    "It remains to be seen whether the increases will be
accepted, but I think the odds are better than 50-50 they
will," Mark Rogers, paper analyst for Prudential Bache said.
    Mead Corp &lt;ME> and Union Camp Corp &lt;UCC> said they are also
considering price increases.
    Rogers, who has been aggressively recommending Stone and
International Paper for several months, said the increases
could stick because plants are running full tilt and little new
capacity is coming on stream.
    "The operating rates in linerboard are running at about 97
to 98 pct of capacity, but demand continues to climb," Gene
Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer of Union Camp
said "The industry is essentially sold out."
    Cartledge said domestic linerboard shipments in January hit
about 1.6 mln tons, six pct higher than January 1986, while
exports hit 170,000 tons, three to four pct higher.
    Nevertheless, rising inventories could nip the increase in
the bud, Lawrence Ross, forest products analyst for Paine
Webber, said.
    "Containerboard inventories have been growing for the past
three months," Ross said. "Over that time inventories rose from
4.8 weeks worth of supplies to 5.9 weeks most recently."
    Also, Ross said that the Jacksonville, Fla., paper mill, 49
pct owned by Stone, is planning to come on stream again soon,
which may help alleviate some of the supply constraints. "The
plant's capacity, by itself, is about two pct of the industry
total," Ross said.
    But, Rogers said the Jacksonville mill "won't be enough" to
significantly ease tight capacity this year. The price increase
is necessary, he said, to attract more investment.
    Rates of return in the industry have been too low in recent
years to merit inventment in new capocity, Rogers said, adding
that he sees prices climbing to the 400 dlrs-a-ton range this
year.
    "The consensus on the Street is changing," he said, "from
whether there will be increases to when is the next increase
and how much."

<TITLE>MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)
will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn
syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.
    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange
expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has
been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in
December, 1985.
    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of
55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank
truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet
milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most
commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other
beverages.
    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production
facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated
by the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months
traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of
March, May, July, September and December.
    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a
minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation
of one dlr per CWT.
    "We hope the producers and users of fructose will be
actively involved, those producers being the large processors,
the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage
bottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for all
types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries
that utilize fructose."

<TITLE>SIEMENS WANTS TO AMEND TELECOM PLUS &lt;TELE> PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Telecom Plus International Inc
said &lt;Siemens AG>'s Siemens Information Systems wants to amend
its agreement to purchase Telecom's 65 pct interest in Tel Plus
Communications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months.
    Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln
dlr transaction Monday.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
    Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
    Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
and warranties are true.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information
which would make its representations and warranties untrue.
    Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The
65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.
    A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of
all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln
dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year
on the anniversary date of the transaction.
    He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added
to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.
    Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit
Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of
certain intercompany debt until completion of the review.
Telecom said it estimates this to ba about 15 mln dlrs.

additional concession of land in Ghana to seek and mine gold.
    The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an
additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,
contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier.
    The original concession appears to have a substantial
amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or
6/100 ounces, of gold per tonne. But the venture has no firm
estimate on the costs of extracting the gold and no assurances
can be given that the reserves can be mined profitably, the
company said. It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted
tests on the newly granted land but added the land seems to be
similar in geological characteristics to the original land.

<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A counter-proposal from creditor
banks to Argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billion
dlr foreign debt was faulty, an Argentine observer at
negotiations said.
    "The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor
banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, as
it is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party Deputy
Raul Baglini said.
    Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the
steering committee for Argentina's creditor banks in New York,
spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.
    Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account
Argentina's request for a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four
pct growth targets in 1987.
    He said the steering committee wanted only to discuss some
aspects of the request, while Argentina's negotiators were
laying emphasis on a global pacakge.
    The United States said last week it would back a 500 mln
dlr bridge loan to Argentina.

<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Dilson Funaro,
currently on a global tour to seek governmental support for his
efforts to solve Brazil's 108 billion dlrs foreign debt crisis,
said creditors have expressed willingness to help.
    In an interview with the Globo television network,
transmitted from Rome, Funaro said he had proposed a "four-year
plan" to the creditors, which would include a rescaling of the
commitments derived from its debt.
    After visiting the U.S., England, France, West Germany,
Italy and Switzerland, Funaro is now on his way to Tokyo, where
he is to arrive on Sunday for talks with Japanese government
officials as well as private bankers.

<TITLE>LUCKY STORES &lt;LKS>, EDELMAN IN STANDSTILL PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUBLIN, Calif., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lucky Stores Inc said it and
investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
securities.
    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
company said.
    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership
subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed
reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and
restructuring plan.
    Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed
to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of
out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other
costs.
    "This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders
by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and
the accompanying demands on management time," Lucky Stores
chairman John Lillie said in a statement.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
should help the company's profits, analysts said.
    "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
volume users, but status quo for residential users," said
PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
    But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
constrained the company's profits in the long distance
business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
    ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
    Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
its competitors to oppose it filings.
    MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing
yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
in the telephone business.
    Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
industry giant faces.
    "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"
said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn't
see a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. "It
will give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.
    ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
hearings.
    It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United
Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>.
    "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it," a U.S.
Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
to greater competition.
    It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
and in the process they may be altered by the various
constituencies affected by the move.
    "There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
won't happen that fast," said analyst Victor Krueger of the
Gartner Group.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Navy last month grounded half of
its A-6E attack jets for wing inspections after a California
accident but has since returned half of the grounded planes to
service, a Navy spokesman said.
    Kevin Mukri said 186 of the Navy's 340 A-6E aircraft, built
by Grumman Corp, were grounded on Feb. 20 after a Jan. 14 A-6E
crash during a training flight near El Centro, Calif., which
killed one of two crewmen aboard.
    "A subsequent inspection of the wreckage at the Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington showed an apparent inner wing
stress problem," Mukri told Reuters.
    "Ninety-seven of the grounded planes have since undergone
visual inspections and 91 of those have been cleared to return
to service," he said.

<TITLE>IRAN INVESTIGATORS SEEK REAGAN TAPES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House and Senate committees
investigating the Iran arms scandal said they would like to
review tapes of phone conversations between President Reagan
and White House officials, if such tapes exist.
    The committees were responding to a magazine article
that quoted unidentified "sources with first-hand knowledge of
U.S. communications intelligence" as saying there is an archive
of recorded conversations among Reagan administration
officials, including the president.
    The article in Progressive magazine also said the
government had secretly monitored the home telephone of former
National Security adviser Robert McFarlane after he had left
government service in late 1985.
    "According to sources with first hand knowledge of U.S.
communications intelligence operations," the story said, "the
McFarlane intercept grew out of a program that has produced a
still-undisclosed archive of recorded conversations involving
... Reagan, Vice President George Bush, (fired National
Security Council aide) Lt Col Oliver North, (former National
Security Adviser) Adm John Poindexter, (former White House
Chief of Staff) Donald Regan and other key figures in the
Iran-contra arms scandal."
    It said the monitoring was done for security and record
purposes by the top-secret National Security Agency (NSA), and
was apparently done with the consent of those monitored.
    But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied one
premise of the article, saying, "The National Security Agency
said it did not monitor any of McFarlane's conversations."
    He did not comment on the other recorded conversations the
Progressive article said were included in the program.
    "Clearly we would be interested in taking a look if indeed
such tapes exist," a Senate Iran committee aide told Reuters in
response to the magazine article.
    A spokesman for the House Iran committee said the panel
would consider a request to the NSA for copies of the
telephone-tap archive described in the article.
    Several legislators said the tapes, if it is confirmed that
they exist, could prove invaluable to the special House and
Senate committees that were created in January to investigate
Reagan's most damaging political crisis.
    "This sort of evidence could be absolutely crucial in
getting to the bottom of the affair," said Rep. Robert
Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat and member of the House
Intelligence Committee, told Reuters.

to report a loss, without tax benefit, of about 16 mln dlrs for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1986, versus a profit of
295,000 dlrs in fiscal 1985.
    The company added, however, that about 13.6 mln dlrs of the
loss relates to discontinued operations and disposal of
subsidiaries.
    The company said the loss is part of its previously
announced restructuring that includes the sale of its foreign
and domestic units.
    Struthers added that it has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an extension to file its annual report
on form 10-K as a result of delays caused by the restructuring.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> CONFIRMS OWNERSHIP OF USAIR &lt;U> STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc said it owns
more than four mln USAir Group shares or about 15 pct of the
total outstanding.
    TWA said it may acquire additional shares in the open
market, in private transactions, through a tender offer or
otherwise, subject to Department of Transportation approval.
    TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir
rejected the offer yesterday, calling it a last-minute attempt
to interfere with its takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc.
    A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application
for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of
Transportation, and later today it will file a response to
USAir's motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application.
    TWA said it made the statement today on its stock position
in USAir in response to inquiries.
    Traders said they believed TWA Chairman Carl Icahn was the
buyer of an 855,000 share block crossed today by Salomon
Brothers.
    USAir stock was trading at 50-3/4, up 2-1/4 on heavy volume
of 3.1 mln shares. TWA stock fell 3/8 to 30-5/8.
    While analysts and arbitragers have speculated that Icahn
may have made the offer for USAir in order to trigger the
acquisition of his own airline, Wall Street today began to take
Icahn's effort more seriously.
    "I think he's going to be the next Frank Lorenzo of Wall
Street," said one market source. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air, has added to his airline with the acquisitions of Eastern
Airlines and People Express Airlines.
    There was also speculation that Icahn would like to buy
USAir and then sell TWA as a merged company.

<TITLE>GROUP TO BOOST FAIRCHILD INDUSTRIES (FEN) STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>An investor group led by New York
investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild
Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its
holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation
company's outstanding stock.
    The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries
shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.
    The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust
regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional
shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the
total outstanding stock.
    The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild
Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe
management has been successful in enhancing or protecting
shareholder values."
    It said it was considering the additional share purchases
to enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over the
future management and policies of the issuer."
    It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership
it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in
management policies, available financial resources and other
factors.
    The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other
measures intended to influence Fairchild management and
policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.
    The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore
investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles
that is advised by Soros.
    The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2,
it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold
6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.
    A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had told
the company he was not dissatisfied with its management.
    "Contrary to the filing, Mr. Soros has told the company
today that he is not dissatisfied with management," Fairchild's
Bill Fulwider told Reuters.
    However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing to
say at this time about Soros' disclosure that he may buy up
enough additional Fairchild shares to hold as much as 49.9 pct
of the company's outstanding stock.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Payless Cashways Inc chairman David
Stanley told analysts the company's first quarter results to be
reported March 17 will be better than the seven cts per share
reported in the year ago quarter.
    "It was not a wonderful sales quarter, but it only
represents 14 pct of the year's total results," Stanley said.
    Stanley also said that 1987 full year sales will be in
excess of 1.8 billion dlrs as compared to the 1.5 billion dlrs
reported in 1986. He also said that analysts' estimates of 1.55
dlr per shr for 1987 "are not crazy."
    Payless reported net income of 1.22 dlr per share in 1986.
    "The economy may not get a lot better, but we expect our
advantages in the lumber industry and cost cutting measures to
keep us competitive," Larry Kunz, chief financial officer,
said.
     The company acquired Knox Lumber Co for about 24.3 mln
dlrs in October 1986.
    Stanley said the company's stronger-than-optimal balance
sheet will enable it to make further acquisitions but no
negotiations are going on at the current time.
    He said some benefits of a new management information
system will be felt in 1987 and more substantially in 1988.

<TITLE>FED'S HELLER URGES OVERHAUL OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert
Heller said the U.S. legal and regulatory framework of the U.S
financial system needs a complete overhaul so American banks
can be more competitive in international markets.
    "It has become abundantly clear that our financial system
must be overhauled to bring it up to the standard that will be
required if we are to remain the leading financial power of the
world in the coming years," Heller said in a speech prepared for
delivery to a financial services industry conference.
    Heller said a patchwork approach to changing the nation's
banking and financial services laws will not work.
    "Instead, a comprehensive overhaul of the entire financial
system is called for," he said.
    Heller said he was encouraged that Congress would take a
comprehensive look at reforming the nation's banking laws after
they enact legislation now pending that would recapitalize the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and give federal
regulators more power to deal with failing banks.
    Heller said he liked the concept of the financial services
holding company, which would allow a bank to exist side by side
with other financial services companies. He said that would end
the debate on securities powers for banks.
    "The holding company may own both a securities house and a
bank, so that both services may be provided to the same
customer, subject to safeguards against conflicts of interest,"
he said.
    Such an institution be in a better position to compete in
the financial services markets around the globe, he said.
    Heller said he expects world trade to expand more rapidly
that domestic production and that traditional trade finance
should grow with it.
    "It may be time to dust off the old letters of credit and to
prepare for an increase in traditional export financing
opportunities," Heller said.
    But he warned that protectionist sentiments could "kill the
golden goose that is about to provide new profit opportunities
for international traders and bankers alike that will benefit
consumers by providing them with cheaper goods."

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Oil Corp said it is reorganizing
its U.S. exploration and producing operations into a single
affiliate, Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. Inc, to be
headquartered in Dallas, effective April one.
    The Mobil Corp subsidiary said the operations are presently
run from three affiliates located in Denver, New Orleans and
Houston.
    It said about 300 employees will be relocated to Dallas,
adding these will be primarily in management, administrative
and staff functions.
    Mobil Oil said most technical and field operating people
will remain at their current locations but some staff functions
will be reduced.
    Spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the
impact of any reductions.
    The company said the new affiliate will comprise four
producing divisions and six exploration divisions. Four of the
exploration divisions will be located with producing divisions
in Denver, Houston, New Orleans, and Midland, Texas. The
remaining two will be in Oklahoma City and Bakersfield, Calif.
    Mobil Oil said the reorganization will "enhance our
profitability" by emphasizing technology and improved
communications, adding it will be able to respond quickly to
changes in business environment.
    The company said C.E. Spruell, now vice president,
international producing operations, has been appointed
president and general manager of the new affiliate.

banks to Argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billion

    "The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor
banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, as
it is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party Deputy
Raul Baglini said.
    Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the

spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.
    Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government's move to pare its huge
financing costs by shortening debt maturities has left more
room for other borrowers and sparked a lively market for
treasury bills, senior market analysts said.
    The Bank of Canada, Ottawa's fiscal agent in the
marketplace, revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowing
needs has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms and
heavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction, issued in
terms of up to one year.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," the Bank of Canada said in its 1986
annual report released this week.
    The government has said its budget deficit financing
requirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1987, from 30 billion dlrs the prior year.
Projected fiscal 1988 requirements are 21.3 billion dlrs.
    The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bond
issues, nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10
years. Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market new
issues with terms in the two- to five-year range.
    Meanwhile, treasury bills outstanding at year end totalled
nearly 70 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over
the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    Although the amount of money saved from moving away from
the long bonds was not disclosed, bond experts believe it was
considerable because of the much lower interest premiums paid
on short term debt.
    But market watchers were unsure what affect the move will
have on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadian
bonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preference
for long term financings.
    Bond traders said the Japanese, who purchased a record 9.5
billion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year, have adapted to the
changes by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to
the medium term issues offered by Ottawa.
    "Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six
months has been very much concentrated in the medium term
maturities," noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be
identified.
    Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually
develop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years.
    Said David Gluskin, vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc, "When interest rates finally seem to have stopped
going down, there is going to be a flood of people trying to
lock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in
the door."
    But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates
trending down, investors appear to welcome the change,
especially the greater treasury bill financing.
    "The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active,"
said Michael Berry, vice-president of the securities firm,
Walwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd.
    The change also improves receptivity in the market for
other borrowers, including provincial governments, the big
utilities and corporations.
    "There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end
now, that also may be the result that any percieved shortage
has probably been taken up by provincial funding activities,"
commented Berry.

<TITLE>BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Strikes by Brazil's 40,000
seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing
major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt
crisis.
    A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25
years and union leaders say they have seriously affected
Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.
    On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest
payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp
deterioration in its trade balance.
    Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most
petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial
heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for
higher fuel prices.
    There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages
could lead to a serious fuel shortage.
    The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the
72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.
    The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today
entitled "Dangerous Confrontation," said: "From the economic
point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,
with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the
country's external trade."
    The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected
offers of up to 100 pct.
    Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due
to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior
official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao
Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless
of the tribunal's ruling.
    Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse
over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price
freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not
only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station
owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao
Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.
    Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of
Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for
exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.
    Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their
profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six
U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).
    Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last
night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still
could.
    Political sources said the government of President Jose
Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel
supply situation.

<TITLE>DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
energy industry analysts said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
pay down debt, analysts said.
    "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst
who asked not to be named.
    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale "at
the right price."
    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
Encor shares do not pay dividends.
    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
    "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd
oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
    "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
they have been able to in recent years," he added.
    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
dlrs in early February.
    The company also recently set up its own operating
management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
    Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So
(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.
    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
Commerce Bank.
    "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
    "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.
    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
holding.
    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very
attractive."

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES JAPAN OPEN MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The director of the Treasury
Department's office of international banking and portfolio
investment said Japan should open its bond and stock markets to
more U.S. firms.
    "The Treasury would like to see greater openness of
Jaspanese markets, including more U.S. firms admitted to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, and an increased role for U.S. financial
firms in the Japanese Government bond market," Ammerman said in
a prepared speech for a conference on financial services
sponsored by Georgetown University.
    Ammerman also said the Reagan administration hopes "any
discrimination against U.S. banks wishing to set up in the
securities business in Japan in their own name will be
eliminated promptly."
    He said the United States also was pressing Canada to stop
giving favored treatment to domestic banks over U.S.
competitors and was talking with Canadian representatives.
    He said the United States will "press vigorously for
liberalization" of financial services in all foreign markets. If
negotiations fail, "We will not hesitate to take vigorous
actions to promote or protect our interests," he added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior Defense Department official
said he believed President Reagan has decided against an early
deployment of the controversial anti-missile defense system
known as "Star Wars."
    But the official, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard
Perle, told a luncheon Reagan could decide within a few weeks
to adopt a less restrictive interpretation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to justify a move towards
wider "Star Wars" testing and development.
    "I think the president has made a decision not to proceed
with an early deployment of SDI," said Perle, referring to the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as Reagan's anti-missile project
is formally called.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS CREDITORS WILLING TO HELP BRAZIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, MARCH 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Dilson Funaro,
currently on an international tour to seek governmental support
for his efforts to solve Brazil's 108-billion-dlr foreign debt
crisis, said creditors have expressed willingness to help.
    In an interview with the Globo television network,
transmitted from Rome, Funaro said the reception by
representatives of creditor countries with whom he met along
the week was always to seek new ways.
    "Brazil made several adjustments in its economy in the past
which affected the goodwill of its people. We now wish to keep
the country's growth in order to be able to face the problems
of the future," Funaro said.
    The minister said that he had proposed a "four-year plan" to
the creditors, which would include a rescaling of the
commitments derived from its debt.
    "We cannot continue negotiating every year with our
creditors, having to face difficulties in the meantime, not
knowing whether a new package will or will not be approved, as
it is happening to other debtor countries," the minister said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Feedgrains Council is
surprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal's
decision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially
injuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.
    "At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade
in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is
incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much
from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would
threaten that process by caving in to pressures for
protectionism," council president Darwin E. Stolte said.
    Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian trading
relationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains 
support for the free trade negotiations, and also negatively
impact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Department animal
health officials are conducting a national survey of live-bird
markets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, an
infectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.
    The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird
markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once
the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to
determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza
viruses, it said.
    In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to
control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,
it said.
    The survey is expected to be completed by April 15.

<TITLE>HOLIDAY &lt;HIA> UNIT'S NOTES DOWNGRADED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it cut to
B from B-plus 900 mln dlrs of notes due 1994 of Holiday Inns
Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp.
    S and P said the action reflected a change in the issue's
terms to unsecured from secured. That change was made after S
and P's initial rating release on February 20, it noted.
    After the firm's recapitalization, substantially all of its
assets will be pledged to secure bank and other debt totaling
1.4 billion dlrs. S and P said it is making a rating
distinction between secured and unsecured debt because of the
significant amount of secured in Holiday's capital structure.
    However, S and P said that if the amount of secured debt
decreases meaningfully, then the secured and unsecured debt
could be rated equally.
    The 900 mln dlrs of seven-year notes were priced late
yesterday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The notes
were given a 10-1/2 pct coupon and par pricing.
    Holiday Inns also sold yesterday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of
subordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par
pricing. This issue was rated B-minus by S and P.
    Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc said its initial
rating of B-1 for the notes remained appropriate.

<TITLE>U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Advocates of a 0/92 plan for
feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a
disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is
scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional
sources said.
    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English
(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to
implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.
    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987
wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that
scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.
    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,
it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should
be treated equally, they said.
   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then
supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not
offer their proposals next week, sources said.
   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but
whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.
    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first
choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat
farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid
for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of
controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an
even greater cutback in the bill, they said.
    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still
receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)
have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to
include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.
    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm
bill, but to be fair to all crops.
    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would
likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are
greater than to idle the land, economists said.
    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is
premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the
House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the
impacts of such a program.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CRISIS SPURS RETHINK OF DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's economic crisis is forcing a
wholesale re-examination of the established strategy for
dealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.
    While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeed
in his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the
debt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least
some bankers that new ideas are needed.
    "The time has come to look at the alternatives," one
seasoned debt rescheduler said.
    Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicating
the 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to in
principle last October was prompting top bankers to examine 
the way they are managing the debt crisis.
    Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recently
of "debt fatigue" and the need to breathe new life into debt
rescheduling procedures.
    There are already signs of change. Japanese banks are
setting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer
some LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,
improve financial management and get tax breaks.    
    But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role
will be gradual. "The process is such that you cannot expect
tangible progress in a short period of time," one banker said.
    Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and
several European capitals in the past week when he called on
government officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a
political dialogue on debt.
    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, for
instance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such
as debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending
agencies.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," Mulford told
a House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any
proposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks
would be a non-starter in Congress.
    But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote
accounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps
and debt securitization and to enable banks to consider
interest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.
    Experts say the government must also make it easier for
banks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.
    Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banks
to explore different options. "The banks should be encouraged
to look at the so-called menu approach," he said.
    Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates
intact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their
exposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.
    Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to
receive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to
new loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loans
that fund the interest payments on the old debt.
    To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome
negotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of "exit
bonds", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors
in exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The banks
would be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.
    Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the
commercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.
    The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was
challenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the original
architect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a
time to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.
    The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. "There
does seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the
bank advisory committees," a U.S. official said.
    Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on
Monday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and
that U.S. banks are over-represented on them.
    Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria's
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to the
charge. "Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer
prepared to bail out the U.S. banks," he told reporters in New
York this week.
    While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, some
have started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still
the right tool for the job.
    "The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity
of commercial banks alone, at least in some cases," one top New
York rescheduler said.
    But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger
role, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.
    "It's the worst form of government there is apart from all
the others," one banker said, paraphrasing former British prime
minister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy.

that the Congress and trade show will be divided into two parts
in 1988.
    Next years APC, held in Atlanta, will be a business session
only and will continue to be the first week of March.
    The trade show is being changed into a new international
event called the World Pork Expo. The first expo will be held
in June 1988 in Des Moines with an expanded format, they said.
    Executive vice-president Orville Sweet said the decision to
spilt the show and Congress came about because there are
producers who never get to see the trade show floor.
    "It makes sense that we divide the business session from
the trade show," Sweet said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board member Robert
Heller said the trend toward global financial markets required
that all participants be treated even-handedly on such matters
as bank capital requirements.
    The recent U.S.-U.K. agreement on capital adequacy provided
a model for others, including Japan, Heller told a Georgetown
University conference on financial markets.
    "If they (the Japanese bank) want to do more business in
Europe or the United States they have got to adhere to
international standards," he said.
    Heller said there were talks currently between the United
States and Japan on bank rules.
    He said the trend toward internationalization in financial
services would cause markets to move to centers with the least
regulation.
    "That is not desirable.  We want to have a sensible amount
of regulation," Heller said.

<TITLE>FORGED EXXON &lt;XON> ZERO-COUPON EURONOTES FOUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp said that forgeries of a
20-year zero-coupon Euronote issued by its Exxon Capital Corp
subsidiary have been discovered in the European market.
    The issue involved was launched in 1984 and matures on
November 15, 2004. About 1,900 notes with a total face value of
19 mln dlrs and a market value of about four mln dlrs have been
identified so far, the company said.
    Exxon said that Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, the fiscal and
paying agent for the issue, Euro-clear and Cedel (the two major
European securities clearing systems), and police in London and
Brussels are investigating the case.
    Indications of forgeries came to light on Wednesday at
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co in London, which acts as Euro-clear's
depositary, and Exxon said they were confirmed today.
    Euro-clear told Exxon that it has examined to its
satisfaction all the notes at the depositary and is checking
the authenticity of new deposits of the notes as they enter the
Euro-clear System.
    Cedel is also reviewing all notes within its system, Exxon
added. At Exxon's direction, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co stands
ready to validate any notes in order to establish their
authenticity, Exxon said.
    A spokeswoman for Exxon was unable to say whether
secondary-market trading in the notes had been affected or who
would have legal responsibility for reimbursing defrauded
investors.
    Zero-coupon forgeries have turned up in the Euromarket
before. Because there are no interest coupons attached to the
bond certificates, they are easier to forge than coupon issues,
market sources said.

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS EXPORT BONUS COULD BE FUNDED FROM CCC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the export enhancement program (eep) could be funded from
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) if the one billion dlrs
appropriated for export bonus by Congress is exhausted.
    Lyng told reporters lack of funding should not be a
constraint on the program because USDA has the authority to use
CCC funds to continue the program. He noted Congress authorized
up to 1.5 billion dlrs for eep.
    Earlier this week, Leo Mayer, associate administrator of
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, said 865 mln dlrs of the
one billion in appropriated funds for eep have been used. USDA
officials said if all the eep offers announced are accepted by
importing countries the one billion dlrs would be exhausted
soon.
    Some Congressional sources have expressed concern that the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) might try to block USDA
from seeking more than the one billion dlrs appropriated for
the program.
    These sources suggested the lack of funds might force USDA
to halt the program, which some commodity groups believe has
given a boost to U.S. exports of some farm products,
particularly wheat and wheat flour.
    However, Lyng's comments seemed to suggest that USDA could
at least temporarily continue the program using CCC funds and
would not be forced to curtail eep.

<TITLE>SEMICONDUCTOR FEBRUARY BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO 1.13</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CUPERTINO, Calif., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Semiconductor Industry
Association said the February three-month average book-to-bill
ratio was 1.13 pct, compared to a revised 1.12 pct in January.
    The January figure was revised from the 1.11 pct reported
last month.
    In its monthly survey of U.S., European and Japanese
semiconductor makers, the association said average orders for
February totaled 788.2 mln dlrs, compared with 780.2 mln in
January and 684.3 mln in February a year ago.
    A book-to-bill ratio of 1.13 means that for every 100 dlrs
worth of product shipped, manufacturers received 113 dlrs worth
of new orders.
    The association said February shipments were 677.8 mln
dlrs, up 4.9 pct from the 645.9 mln shipped during January and
seven pct higher than the 633.5 mln reported in February a year
ago.
    Three month average billings for February totaled 699.4 mln
dlrs, up 0.2 pct from January's 697.8 mln, the association also
said.
    "The continuing improvement in the U.S. semiconductor
market reflects the fact that U.S. electronics equipment
manufacturers' sales are finally increasing," Semiconductor
Industry Association president Andrew Procassini said.
    The figures of the past few months suggest that the
industry is experiencing a gradual recovery that is likely to
continue, said Edward White, semiconductor analyst at E.F.
Hutton Group Inc.
    But he also said semiconductor makers still need a pickup
in capital spending within the high-technology sector before
any dramatic upturn can take place.
    The February figures show strong single-month improvement
in the semiconductor industry, but after closer examination
they may prove to be disappointing to investors, said Michael
Gumport, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    "On the face of it these numbers are below recent
expectations," Gumport also said.
    A 1.15 or higher book-to-bill ratio had been expected,
Gumport said.
    He also said the three month average book-to-bill ratio,
which was reported earlier than expected, reflected a downward
revision in the December order total, Gumport said.
    December's order rate amounted to 757.5 mln dlrs, down from
the earlier-reported 783.8 mln dlrs, the association said.

<TITLE>CHAIRMAN OF KING WORLD &lt;KWP> FACES CHARGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Miami, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roger King, chairman of King World
Productions Inc, faces charges of cocaine possession, auto
theft and strong-arm robbery stemming from his arrest in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., last month, police said.
    The report of King's legal problems sent the stock of his
company -- a syndicator of some of television's most popular
talk and game shows -- down sharply on Wall Street.
    Fort Lauderdale police spokesman Ott Cefkin said King was
arrested on February 21 on charges that he beat up a taxi
driver during a dispute over a fare and then stole the man's
car. After King was taken in custody, police found three small
bags of cocaine in his shirt pocket, Cefkin said.
    King World distributes Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and the
Oprah Winfrey Show. According to the police report, King, 42,
was in Fort Lauderdale visiting his brother when the incident
occurred.
    Police said a taxi driver picked King up outside a Fort
Lauderdale night club but stopped the car after a short
distance when he became concerned that his passenger would be
unable to pay the fare.
  "Mr. King attacked the driver, punched him and then took the
cab and drove off," Cefkin said.
  King was arrested by police a few minutes later and was
charged with strong-arm robbery, auto theft and possession of a
small quantity of cocaine, police said.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's ruling in favor of a duty on
U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn
Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other
nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the
association.
    "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and
just change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Hall
told Reuters.
    A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm
policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and
supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85
cts per bushel.
    "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "The
amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."
    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument
that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and
that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus
causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government
payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.
    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that
other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack
U.S. farm programs.
    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm
programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall
said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of
U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the
imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.

<DATELINE>    BIRMINGHAM, Ala, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Healthcare Services Of America
Inc said it will write off about 16 mln dlrs in non-recurring
expenses in 1986.
    It also said it expects income from operations to be about
breakeven for 1986 and the estimated loss for the year to be
about the same as the writeoffs.
    Results will be released by March 31, 1987.
    Included in the writeoffs were six mln dlrs in
developmental costs, six mln dlrs in unamortized loan costs and
debt discounts and four mln dlrs in other non-recurring costs.
    The company said it continues to be in default of certain
financial and non-financial covenants set forth in its major
loan documents.
    It said negotiations continue with the banks, but has no
assurance that such funding will continue.
    It said it authorized Smith barney, Harris Upham and Co to
seek a business combination with third parties.
    Healthcare also said the board has authorized the sale or
lease of certain assets to reduce the cash required from the
revolving credit line for completion of current construction
projects.

net income of 3.5 mln dlrs on sales of 54.4 mln dlrs

<TITLE>USAIR &lt;U> SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA &lt;TWA></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group said it sought the help
of the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight
with Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order
TWA to sell its USAir shares.
    "What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal
Aviation Act," USAir said.
    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the
Department of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65
billion dlr takeover of USAir.
    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department
of Transportation to dismiss the application.
    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided
pre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide
a competitive and public interest analysis required under
regulations.
    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be
limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding
shares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10
pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir's
stock.
    TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to
more than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.
    TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said the
company had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was in
compliance with the law.

<DATELINE>    PARK RIDGE, ILL., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>An American Farm Bureau
Federation (AFBF) official said that far from hurting Canadian
corn producers, U.S. farm programs benefit all foreign
producers.
    AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response
to the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal
that subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian
growers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S.
cents a bushel.
    "Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified
previous U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign
producers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and
losing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the
price of corn Worldwide," he said.

<TITLE>TAFT&lt;TFB> BIDDERS WOULD SELL ENTERTAINMENT UNIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting
Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell
the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the
investors.
    Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital
Corp &lt;NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan,
declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the
Entertainment Group. "We are considering selling the group,"
Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood
film studios which might be interested.
    Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per
share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12
pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.
    Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but
continues as vice chairman of the company.
    Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by
March 12.
    If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company
financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said.
Narragansett is an investment management company specializing
in leveraged buyout transactions.
    Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to
say investors believe the bidders may raise their price.
    Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and
American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return
telephohe calls seeking comment.
    But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said "I
don't think it's worth 150 dlrs." He noted Taft recently agreed
to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss.
He said the entertainment group, which includes the
Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a
glut of animated product.
    Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its
major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the
company.
    MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the
company with a distribution of various pieces to the major
shareholders among the possibilities.
    Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin
Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the
belief the company would be worth more with a change in its
strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent
television stations because the company paid too much.

<TITLE>POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Higher oil prices and stronger than
expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.
interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
chart outlook, financial analysts said.
    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment
during February was above market expectations for a rise of
170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
futures that drove the June contract through key technical
support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.
    "I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"
said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level
in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month
trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
led to bullish forecasts by chartists.
    But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.
    Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32
may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
losses.
    "I tend to go along with the double top scenario," said
Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.
    Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact
that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.
    Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner
remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find
support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.
    The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation
that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on
an improving inflation outlook.
    With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, "the inflation
outlook is improving," Leiner said, and that should lead to
relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
prices.
    Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
remains a concern for the inflation outlook.
    Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an
extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.
    "The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"
said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.
    The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
"media induced," Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC
production may be within quotas, "oil stocks are at
tremendously high levels."
    Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil
prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he
said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES SOME S. AFRICAN IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury proposed allowing 
temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
fall.
    The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next
week requests written congressional and public comment within
60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported
for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.
    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
-- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
    "The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal
government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in
a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on
uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for
processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the
act," the Treasury brief said.
    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
the Soviet Union for processing.
    Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African
ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export
"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a
license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission."
    The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods
to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled
organizations for repair or servicing in the United States.
    "The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made
under bond," the brief said.
    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United
States to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation
practiced by South Africa's white minority government,
prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel,
coal and textiles at the end of 1986.

German subsidiary has received a contract valued at about eight
mln dlrs from the Soviet Union to supply engineering and
manufacturing services to build a television parts plant.
    The company's Precision Etched Products unit in Muellheim,
West Germany, signed the contract to provide services that will
enable the Soviets to build a plant to make television tube
aperture masks, it said.
    A BMC spokesman told Reuters the one-year contract will be
for about eight mln dlrs. The contract is the first BMC has had
with the Soviet Union in 10 years ago, he said.
    The project has received the necessary U.S. government

    BMC also said it has entered into a joint venture agreement
with Italy to produce finished single vision plastic eyewear
lenses using a new manufacturing process. It would provide no
further details.

<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A government official said that a
decision by Brazil not to import maize because it forecast a
record harvest would not affect Argentina's exports.
    "We have heard nothing about this, but if Brazil has decided
not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one
of our main customers," Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries
Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said.
    Private sources also said Argentina's exports would not be
affected by Brazil's decision, which Agriculture Minister Iris
Resende announced yesterday in Sao Paulo.
    Brazil had not asked for any Argentine maize, they said.
    They also said a smaller crop and adverse weather this
summer in Argentina had reduced production.
    Braceras said that last year Brazil bought 800,000 tonnes
of Argentine maize but in some years it had not imported any
from Argentina.
    The Soviet Union was Argentina's main customer and Japan
was also becoming a bigger importer of the country's maize, he
said.

<TITLE>DOT DISMISSES TWA &lt;TWA>, USAIR &lt;U> APPLICATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application by
Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
control of USAir Group.
    The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
could put together an application for control that met the
agency's procedural requirements.
    The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
    It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
    In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
    But the DOT said it would not wait.
    "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order
issued late Friday.
    "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.
    "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
procedural rules," the DOT said.
    The agency added that it would continue to consider a
separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
stock through a voting trust.
    USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
did not meet DOT requirements.

    "When the DOT opens for business on Monday morning, we will
be refiling a perfected and completed section 408 application,"
said TWA general counsel Mark Buckstein.
    Buckstein said the DOT ruled the application, which was
filed Wednesday, was incomplete. He said he did not yet know
why the agency objected.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA BAILS OUT ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's central bank said it
acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing &lt;United Asian Bank Bhd>
(UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to
rebuild public confidence in it.
    UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49
mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an
accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central
bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.
    But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by
shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the
Indian Government.
    Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed
shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of
228.74 mln ringgit.
    It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.
    The central bank early this week also announced that it had
bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,
&lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its
capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.
    Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the
shares of the two banks.
    "The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the
recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures
taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the
stability of the these banks," it added.
    The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the
Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an
ailing bank or to buy a stake in it.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity
measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by
a strong earthquake.
    Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on
television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.
A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite
suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.
    Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a
television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a
month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin
oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.
    The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point
Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near
the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.
    Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.
    The government's austerity measures ban the sale of
aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and
no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.
    Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and
holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines
Ministry communique said.

<TITLE>FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard
a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could
rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.
    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no
hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the
Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian
coast last night.
    If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's
worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with
a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the
loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.
    The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was
the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.
    The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914
when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland
collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.
    The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that
took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was
torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.
    In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries
sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and
147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.

were missing, bringing the total of dead or presumed dead to

<TITLE>GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior officials in the West German
coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
international monetary conference in Paris.
    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
increase in income tax.
    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
medium-sized companies.
    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
    The West German government had come under pressure from the
United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
growth was uncertain.
    The government said in January it was aiming for real
growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
    Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion.
Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few
days ago, remains open at the moment."

<TITLE>EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>As a British government investigation got
under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free
Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had
already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.
    Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary
investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry
capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to
leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.
    Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks
through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend
Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.
    Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the
Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned
to pull them out of service at present.
    "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait
and see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBC
radio.
    As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged
hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts
had already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo"
ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.
    In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime
Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on
roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck
areas divided by bulkheads.
    Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German
yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety
standards.
    But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would
have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its
design.
    Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley
said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to
a barge.
    "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out
of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is
compartmentalised and you have more stability," he said.
    Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly
stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.
    "If you do get water into that area then you can get very
severe effects on the stability of the ship," he added.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE AFTER COURT DECISION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hundreds of marines were on alert
at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain
on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court
yesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners
have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.
    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the
workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our
protest until the end," a union leader said.
    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines
take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and
let the marines handle the situation by themselves.
    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to
send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister
Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national
security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has
cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.
    Petrol station owners in four states also continued their
shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two
stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's Armed Forces Commander
General Benny Murdani said warnings about an extremist threat
to the country's forthcoming elections do not mean the security
situation has deteriorated.
   He was quoted in today's edition of the armed forces
newspaper Harian AB as saying the warnings were only an appeal
for vigilance ahead of the April 23 polls.
    Major-General Setijana, military commander of central Java,
said in widely-quoted remarks last week that both leftist and
rightist extremists were planning to sabotage the polls in an
attempt to topple President Suharto's government.
    Murdani told a meeting of the ruling Golkar party in
Jakarta yesterday that he believed the security situation was
now stable.
    However, he also said mass meetings during the election
campaign period should be avoided, as they could trigger what
he termed a critical situation very easily.
    About 60 people died in accidents and election-related
violence during the last parliamentary elections in 1982.

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By WALKER SIMON, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

<TITLE>EC FARM LIBERALISATION SEEN HURTING THAI TAPIOCA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Any European Community decision to
liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca
industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the
Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).
    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to
cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more
competitive than tapioca in the European market.
    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more
than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by
Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25
mln tonnes a year until 1990.
    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff
loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct
import duty.
    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,
suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.
    He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are
close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear
completely."
    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it
had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling
on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China has raised the prices it pays
farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse
a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture,
Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said.
    The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt
intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve
crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He
gave no details of the price increases.
    On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases
from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of
purchasing through agents.
    He said the state will increase investment in agriculture
and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production
materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices.
    The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and
payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a
low state-fixed price.
    He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln
tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year
and an actual 391 mln last year.
    He gave no more details.

<TITLE>GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Increased federal government borrowing
needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
higher this year, bond market sources say.
    "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities
investment house in Frankfurt said.
    The sources also said the government had already stepped up
its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
only starting last May.
    One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's
just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added
conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
favourable for raising new debt.
    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
through bonds was 26.6 billion.
    The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
through the more acceptable loan stock form.
    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the
portfolio manager said.
    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
the government to reduce borrowings.
    The sources said the government would fall far short of
covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.
    A finance ministry economist said the government did not
expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
net 22.3 billion marks this year.
    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
into effect.
    "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.
    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
dollar may now rise against the mark.
    "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in
London said.
    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said.

coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five
dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an
increase in export volume, industry sources said.
    The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky
coal and at 43.80 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal, fob.
    Japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both
areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said.
    The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to
3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88, but the Soviet Union urged Japan to
increase the amount to 6.5 mln, they said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The special prosecutor in the Iran arms
scandal is expected to bring indictments that could include
felony charges against senior Reagan administration officials,
the New York Times reported.
    It quoted law enforcement officials with knowledge of the
investigation as saying special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, who
is investigating the scandal, was focusing on three areas.
    The paper identified these as conspiracy to defraud the
government, obstructing justice and making false statements to
the government. It said the prosecutor had not ruled out any
suspects, including current and former government officials.
    But the paper said Walsh, in his investigation of the sale
of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to the U.S.-backed
contra rebels in Nicaragua, was running short of time. This was
because Congress has begun granting immunity to key figures in
the affair to speed up congressional investigations.
    The paper quoted one official as saying that, while
obstruction of justice was usually hard to prove, evidence of a
cover-up "may have been comically obvious here."

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT OUTLOOK SEEN AS UNCERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for Australian industrial
investment is uncertain, with capital spending at an historical
low and business overly dependent on domestic demand, the
Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the National Institute
of Economic and Industry Research said.
    The organizations were commenting in their monthly Economic
Focus on a survey commissioned by the Australian Council of
Trade Unions concluded.
    Private investment as a proportion of gross domestic
product fell to 9.8 pct in 1985/86 from 15 pct in 1981 and is
forecast to decline to 8.8 pct in 1987/88, the Focus said.
    Earlier studies indicated private investment could sustain
a two pct long-term economic growth rate, but the latest
figures suggested this could not be maintained, it said.
    The Australian dollar's depreciation, coupled with research
incentives, is increasing the profitability of investment for
exports but several factors inhibit growth. These include weak
commodity prices, high fixed capital costs, uncertain domestic
economic policy and corporate debt.
    Firms have tended to finance expansion with debt rather
than equity, leading to a 39 pct rise in the ratio of interest
payments to gross cash flow between 1980/85, the survey found.
    Economic Focus said many companies looked for a 2.5 to 4.5
year payback on capital investment or export development --
often too short a period to secure markets.
    The relatively low incentive to produce for export in part
reflected the ownership of Australian industry, they said.
    Sixty-seven pct of Australian-owned companies said external
demand was conducive to investment against only 27 pct for
foreign-owned companies.
    The survey covered 45 companies accounting for about 25 pct
of total investment, Economic Focus said.

<TITLE>JAPAN RATING AGENCIES IN BATTLE WITH U.S. GIANTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Three Japanese credit rating agencies are
entering into fierce competition with &lt;Moody's Japan K.K.> and
&lt;Standard and Poor's Asia Inc>, the local branches of the two
U.S. Giants, as the Japanese credit market opens up to
foreigners, Japanese rating agency managers said.
    Standard and Poor's recent triple-A rating of &lt;Chiyoda Fire
and Marine Insurance Co Ltd's> claims-paying ability caused the
Japanese agencies, which had rated Chiyoda's convertible bond
only A-plus, to come under some criticism for being too
conservative, they said.
    Chiyoda is Japan's eighth largest non-life insurer.
    Standard and Poor's Corp has been in the business for more
than a century while &lt;Moody's Investors Service Inc> was
founded more than 80 years ago. Each has rated some 20,000 to
30,000 U.S. And about 100 Japanese issues.
    With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through
overseas financing companies, Chiyoda's rating will stimulate
their interest in using the U.S. Agencies, the analysts said.
    Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on its
strong capitalisation, stable performance and high levels of
unrealised appreciation, particularly in its stock portfolio.
    The U.S. Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory
environment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate.
    Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratings
on the claims-paying ability of &lt;Sumitomo Life Insurance Co>
and &lt;Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's,
the first ratings given to Japanese life insurers.
    Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off
shocks from any foreign investment, Standard and Poor's said.
    A month ago &lt;Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assigned
an AAA rating to &lt;Financial Securities Assurance Inc>, a U.S.
Firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities.
     "NIS has assigned rates on a U.S. Firm for the first time in
Japan, which was the first step into the U.S. Rating market,"
Kazuya Kumura, general manager of NIS, said.
    Kyosuke Yoshida, managing director of Japan Bond Research
Institute (JBRI), said, "Agencies should be more actively used
to respond better to growing overseas investor interest."
    Takeshi Watanabe, president of Japan Credit Rating Agency
Ltd (JCRA), said, "(Our) advantages are that we have a deeper
understanding of business practices in Japan, other Asian
nations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert
and quick to react to domestic news."
     JBRI, with 12 years' experience, is Japan's largest agency.
The other two have been in business for two years.
    Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by
Japanese residents, which is expected soon, will stimulate
local agencies to grow quickly, securities analysts said.
    The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by
gradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation.
    In December it allowed non-residents holding at least an
A-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai, shogun and
euroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent
financial criteria.
     But local companies, regardless of the rating obtained for
a planned bond, must meet the tough financial criteria set by
commissioned banks and underwriters, which includes minimum net
asset requirements and capitalisation, local agency managers
said.
    Commissioned banks are responsible for protecting
bondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments.
    Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by
the very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanese
credit rating agencies, the managers said.
     "The idea of rating in Japan has been woven into
prerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial
criteria," JCRA's Watanabe said.
    The Finance Ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds.
    "An internationally comprehensive market system is needed to
lure more overseas investors into the Japanese market," JBRI's
Yoshida said.

developing countries, Bangladesh Commerce Minister M.A. Munim
told officials from 30 Asian countries in the Group of 77.
    The officials are meeting to finalise the agenda for the
group's regional ministerial conference here Saturday.
Delegates from all 43 Asian member countries of the G-77 are
expected to attend the later meeting.
    Commerce Ministry officials said the countries will try to
adopt a common strategy to counter protectionist measures by
developed countries and forge developing country cooperation
    Commerce Secretary A.B.M. Ghulam Mostafa said the officials
would discuss issues relating to financial resources,
commodities, international trade and least developed countries,
and formulate "concrete measures towards concerted action."
    Recommendations of the Dhaka meeting will be placed before
the July United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
meeting at Geneva, officials said.
    The Dhaka meeting would also discuss the possibility of
setting up a "South Bank," along the lines of the Asian
Development Bank, to boost financial exchanges and economic
coperation between developing countries. It has not been
proposed formally and no details were given.

<TITLE>FOREIGN BROKERS MAY GET MORE ACCESS TO JAPAN BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses are thinking of
allowing foreign brokerages to underwrite more Japanese
government bonds from April, securities managers said.
    The average foreign brokerage now underwrites only around
0.07 pct of each such issue's volume, they told Reuters.
    The proposal is a response to overseas calls for Japan to
liberalise its markets in the trend towards global trading.
    Japanese brokerages are consistently heavy buyers of U.S.
Treasury issues. &lt;Nomura Securities International Inc> and
&lt;Daiwa Securities America Inc> were named primary dealers in
U.S. Government securities in December, they noted.
    Brokerages within the government bond-writing syndicate are
now negotiating by how much foreign house subscriptions to
government bonds should be raised, the managers said.
    The syndicate members agreed in April, 1982 that 26 pct of
10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93
securities firms, 17 of them foreign, and 74 pct by banks.
    The Finance Ministry later approved the arrangement.
    Foreign brokers want to underwrite more government bonds
due to their end-investor appeal. &lt;Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd>
caught market attention by buying 45 billion yen of the 100
billion of government two-year notes auctioned on February 3.
    Salomon's operation was an attempt to demonstrate its
commitment to the Japanese market in the hope of expanding its
underwriting share of 10-year bonds, securities sources said.
    They said that to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct
share, cut local brokerages' share, or introduce auctions to
the government bond primary market, the sources said.
    Bankers are likely to oppose losing any share and the
Finance Ministry is unwilling to introduce auctions on the
ground that it would slow smooth absorption of bonds in the
secondary market, securities manager said.

<TITLE>U.S. SEEKS MAJOR JAPANESE ECONOMIC CHANGE IN APRIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States has openly attacked
Japan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time and
warned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be
significant, senior U.S. Officials said.
    In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan's
overall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its
fiscal position is not as dire as it says.
    The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S.
Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating
attempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports.
    The U.S. Attack represents a distinct shift by the
conservative Reagan administration, which until recently has
been sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government
role in the economy, diplomats said.
    Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take
action to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said
the April package must be more than routine.
    Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do
not expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of
last April's measures.
    That means accelerated public investment, lower interest
rates on government housing loans and measures to pass along
the benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of which
would have a major immediate economic impact.
    Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to
stimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the
Finance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S.
Policy.
    But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by
fanning resentment against U.S. Interference in domestic
affairs.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japan
would stimulate the economy not in response to U.S. Criticism,
but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen.
    The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousness
within the Reagan administration.
    U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen
Wallis told reporters last week the U.S. Does not necessarily
want an increase in Japan's budget deficit.
    "There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its
economy," he said.
    The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
    What is new is U.S. Backing for the position.
    At last week's talks, Japanese officials said, they argued
Tokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boost
the economy with funds from the giant postal savings system.
    But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for,
and receive, the figures supporting the new U.S. Position, a
senior U.S. Official said.
    Other western officials are not so sure. They said it would
take time to boost public investment much further, as there are
not that many projects in the pipeline.
    Stepped-up capital spending would help domestic
construction companies, but it would not have much impact on
imports, they added.

pct growth over the year ending in November.
    MAS said in its latest monthly statistical bulletin the
December increase was largely due to seasonal year-end demand.
    The demand deposit component of M-1 increased to 4.79
billion dlrs in December from 4.62 billion in November and 4.05
billion in December 1985.
    Currency in active circulation rose to 5.03 billion dlrs in
December from 4.85 billion in November and 4.74 billion a year
earlier.
    Broadly-based M-2 money supply rose 1.6 pct to 30.95
billion dlrs during December after a 1.7 pct rise in November,
bringing year-on-year growth to 10.0 pct for the year ending in
December against 10.2 pct for the year ending in November.

<TITLE>CHINESE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE UP AFTER WEAK 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of China's industrial output in
January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the
same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.
    Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January
1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.
    The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to
last year's poor performance. "No significant improvement was
made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes
were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the
last quarter of 1986.
    The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose
and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.
    It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987
industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with
better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway
throughout the country. It gave no more details.
    The official industrial growth target this year is seven
pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year.

<TITLE>IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese customers have bought nearly six
mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
customers with different formulas. One company has bought
800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.

    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
markets, oil traders said.
    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
    Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
are supporting spot price levels, they said.

    Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one
Japanese trader said.
    The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have
been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the
official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the
price related to processing arrangements.
